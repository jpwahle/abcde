I installed this Rom 4 days ago as nougat 7.1.2. \n\nWith our phone not getting the update to nougat yet, (Canada). I was ready to get rid of this phone and move on. \n\nI broke my screen a few months ago and started looking for a new device. I love this Moto X Play, it's everything I need in a device and then some. With the battery life being so good and the size of the whole phone being perfect, I just can't find anything I thought I would like. I know the new x4 is coming, but there are a few things that really turned me off of it.\n\nSo a few months ago I bought a Nextbit Robin to tide me over until the near future so I could maybe wait until after x4 was launched. I chose the Robin because of price and pretty much price only..... Not a bad phone. But it pretty much fell short in every aspect against my x play except for speed. The Nextbit was fast compared to my 2 year old x play.\n\nAfter a couple months of being unsatisfied every time I took the Robin out of my holster at work, I grabbed my shattered screen x play and booted it up to check for an update. There wasn't any (Sept 26th). I sat down and listened to the 1552636262 notifications come through on FB since the phone hasn't been on in a while.... While I held it I couldn't stop thinking how much better it felt than the Robin....\n\nI hit Google hard, I looked for roms. I found a rom. It was AOSP Extended. I hadn't installed a rom in a few years (last time was on my Nexus 5). A few quick refreshers on the Google machine and I was pumped to have twrp installed, bootloader unlocked and gapps and aex sideloaded. After a cache wipe and a first boot that took way too long. (I was excited and impatient), I got to use this Rom!\n\nThis is like a new phone. It's rocket fast compared to marshmallow, battery life is as good as ever, it's running 7.1.2 with latest security patch, it's not the Nextbit Robin and it is my lovely Moto X Play with recent Android (I believe Oreo is in the works). It ends up being much faster than the Robin after disabling animations and customising some stuff.\n\nIf your looking to refresh your moto x play, go ahead and install this Rom. I'm 4 days in and haven't had any issues, this Rom is solid. Also, I just ordered a new screen and digitizer and frame assembly for my old faithful and if I can get that installed I'll run this thing for another few years if I can.\n\n\n\nWhoooooo!","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MotoX","subreddit_id":"t5_2xebt","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AOSP Extended Rom on Moto X Play 1563 is like a new phone!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MotoX/comments/73iimk/aosp_extended_rom_on_moto_x_play_1563_is_like_a/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

It made it look like it would use \"edgy\" humor as its only draw. However, I decided to give it a shot because F is for family similarly looked like absolute shit if you only watched the trailer, but the show actually ended up being an incredibly well written show. Also, Netflix has a pretty good track record with its adult animations. Bojack and F is For Family are imo superb. So, I am 8 episodes into season one of big mouth and this is my opinion:\nIts not nearly as bad as the trailer made it look. Sure, it does often rely on \"edgy\" gross out and sexual humor to make a punchline, but I think that as opposed to say family guy, there is more to this show. This show is at its best when its humor relies on its characters. The two best examples I can think of are in episode 5 and in episode 8. In episode five, there is a scene where one of the main character's older sister tries to explain to him that women are not turned on necesarily by sex, but by everthing surrounding sex. It is hilarious watching a 12 year old boy trying to understand this concept. The second example is in episode 8 (which by the way is probably the best episode in the season) where the same character is at a high school party and is scared of hooking up with a high school girl because he is insecure about his body. Both are really funny, and they serve to build on the character. There is also some actual character development in the show. For example, in episode 9 Jessi finds out that her mother is having an affair with another woman, and we go through this montage in her head of her parents' relationship falling apart. It actually made you feel for her. \nNow all of this doesn't mean the show is flawless by any stretch of the word. The art style and animation are ugly, and there is often a lot of forced \"edgy\" humor, which is actually the biggest criticism of the show. There are also some VERY annoying characters that only serve as punchline dispensers that show up way too much, namely the coach and Lola. All that being said, I think this show is worth watching, and hopefully if they get a greenlight for a second season (which they might actually not sadly) they will take the potential in this first season and do something more with it.","spoiler":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"television","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh6e","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"spoiler","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Big Mouth Actually Wasnt That Bad (minor spoilers)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/73iimy/big_mouth_actually_wasnt_that_bad_minor_spoilers/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

My name's Jose and I'm 19 years old. \n\n\nI'm looking for some good pals. Someone I can talk to everyday and really get to know. I don't really care about what we talk about as long as there's effort on both sides to keep the conversation going. It's kinda hard to keep talking when there's nothing but one worded replies, y'know? I really enjoy voice calling because I just feel like it's way easier to maintain a friendship when you can actually talk to them and hear their voice so I'd really prefer talking to someone who's comfortable with that. It doesn't have to be right away so if you're shy at first it's totally okay! I'm a dweeb so I spend most of my time at home playing games or surfing the web. So I'll have tons of time to talk and I try my best to reply somewhat quickly. I wouldn't mind talking to anyone. As long as you're kind and can keep a conversation then we should be all good. However, I'd prefer talking to people near my age (17-21) and I'd prefer talking to someone near my timezone too. \n\n\nIf you enjoy/do any of the following you should definitely message me! \n\n* Mario Kart\n\n* Pokemon\n\n* Super Smash Brothers\n\n* Steven Universe\n\n* Play on PC (I have other consoles but don't have the subscriptions to play online with them) \n\n* Memes of any kind \n\n* Dragon Ball/Z/Super (Fuck GT) \n\n* Naruto/Boruto\n\n* My Hero Academia \n\n* Laughing \n\nSo if I sound interesting to anyone reading this then please don't hesitate to send me a PM with how you wanna talk. I have kik, snapchat, skype, and discord. I really don't like talking through PMs because it's just super clunky and it occasionally notifies me when I have a message and I really don't want to keep refreshing Reddit until there's an orange envelope on the top right corner. I hope to hear from one of you soon and thank you for reading!

I am in Maryland, as is the treatment center that shared the information. Apologies in advance if I'm sharing too many unnecessary details here.\n\nSome background: I am 26 years old, and I do not live with my parents. They are also not involved in any way with paying for any of my treatment; I am on my own insurance plan independent of them, and they do not pay any of my medical bills.\n\nFor the past month or so, I've been participating in an intensive outpatient treatment program for an eating disorder. The program involves individual therapy, group therapy, daily consultation with a psychiatrist, and family therapy. I have had several sessions of family therapy with my parents via phone, since they live several states away. I checked myself into this program of my own volition, and at no point was I ever a danger to myself or others, or incapable of making decisions for myself. I just recognized that I had a problem, that my physical health was declining, and that I needed professional help to get back on track.\n\nThe schedule of the program has been hard for me since the beginning\u2014it's 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, and you are under constant supervision on a locked unit (you are sharing space with the inpatient eating disorder people, so the locks aren't necessarily to keep the outpatient people inside, though they do function that way). I have been taking more than a few unplanned days off of treatment because I'm so exhausted from the grueling schedule and the sheer amount of emotional work that's required. My insurance requires me to attend a minimum of 4 days per week in order to receive coverage for the program, and until this week I was meeting that minimum, but yesterday I took the day off again, which put me below that minimum for the week. I was fully aware of this, and fully prepared for the program to discharge me because of it. I had been having serious concerns about staying in the program, and I felt that my concerns weren't being adequately addressed by my treatment team there\u2014and the treatment team was aware of that.\n\nSince I had a family therapy phone session scheduled with my parents for yesterday afternoon, the family therapist had a perfectly valid reason to call my parents to let them know I wasn't there that day and we'd have to cancel the session. However, she went much further than that\u2014she called my dad and shared lots of the above information with him. She told him I was being discharged for taking too many days off, and that I could be readmitted if I wanted to keep up my attendance.\n\nNow, to be clear, she wasn't calling him because she was concerned for my safety. If she was concerned for my safety, she should (and could) have called my boyfriend, who she knows I live with, and whose number she has. She did not call my boyfriend at all yesterday. My boyfriend is the first emergency contact on all of my medical forms, and I also filled out a medical records release form for him, just in case. I did not sign any sort of release for my parents.\n\nIs this a HIPAA violation? The therapist did try to call me before calling my dad, but I was asleep so I missed her calls. And again, this was not a concern-for-my-safety call. I understand that HIPAA allows for sharing of medical info with family and friends without my explicit consent if I am unavailable to consent and the sharing of info is deemed in my \"best interest.\" But this still seems like a screw-up on her part at best, and pretty manipulative/possibly illegal behavior at worst. Not sure how it could reasonably be considered in an adult patient's \"best interest\" to call their parents and tell on them for not showing up to treatment.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"legaladvice","subreddit_id":"t5_2rawz","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Not sure if HIPAA violation or just boundary issues","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/73ipiq/not_sure_if_hipaa_violation_or_just_boundary/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

I can't even believe I let it get that far. Ever since I was 12 I've been going to therapists regularly. As I was 14 my father died.

Boy was I wrong... I couldn't integrate into the class since I'm too anxious to talk to people.  Now I never catched up socially and I'm basically an outcast. My mother doesn't care about me either, so I literally have noone to talk to other than 45 minutes a week to my therapist. And even when I talk to my therapist I can't be 100% honest because if I talked about contemplating suicide I'd get locked up stationary and only could leave if someone else gave their ok. If that happened I would probably fail another year in school and that would probably destroy my future. Hah \"future\".. Another thing that I recently noticed is that ever since my father died I have lost my personality and humour. I don't really know how else to describe it, it probably has to do with me sitting on my computer all day for the past 2,5 years to surpress everything. Anyway, my point is that I don't think I can handle my pathetic existence much longer, I will see how things play out. Also sorry for the wall of text.

Sorry for the format. Sort of new to reddit and getting the hang of it.\n\n\n\nSo I'm 27 and just had my first real job at a law firm. I got hired in because the guy that they had originally hired had left to do something better. So I thought 'score! I got my real big girl 8 til 4:30 job!' Plus it had always been in the office setting I always wanted to go in. I would be prepping law suits and other office things.\n\n\n\nFor my background: I was a little shiet in high school and thought I had everything planned out. I had joined the Army and wanted to be a Nurse but life decided to be funny and one thing led to another and I got a medical discharge. Didn't want to re-enlist after that so I had a fast food job. Then it led to being trapped in retail and I was....never good at dealing with people.\n\n\n\nFast forward to the present: I had applied for a law firm and thought everything was going to be perfect. I was finally learning how to adult and had even go to a two weeks' paid training in Chicago(I live in Indiana, close to Chicago). \n\n\n\nA week or so after I had got back an email had been sent out to stop filling suits and we had found out that the main attorney had resigned. \n\n\n\nWell, reddit, you can guess what happened after that. Lay offs had begun and I thought I had been safe. Turned out I wasn't and I had been let go a week before Labor Day. Actually my entire department had been laid off. \n\n\n\nEver since then I had been churning out job apps but the area where I live is AWFUL job wise. I had two interviews and I know it isn't a good idea to let them know that you had been laid off. They always asked why after a few weeks have I been applying? My answer: I always enjoyed my time with the law firm but there had been talks in possible lay offs and I wanted to be safe. \n\n\n\nI don't know if it's just them but I haven't gotten a call back and I always freeze up whenever they asked me that. \n\n\n\nThe situation now: I had recently nailed an interview for a laboratory this coming Wednesday and, Reddit, I do NOT want to mess this one up. This one pays close to 15 bucks an hour and I am desperate for a job. I haven't been laid off before so I'm still trying to figure out what to say to that in an interview.\n\n\n\nWhat would be my safe answer if they ask me why I would be leaving the office after a few weeks(Note that I had put there that I'm currently working). \n\n\n\nETA For more information: I have a two year degree in Business Administration from a local college because, again I was stupid and just like any other teenager who thought she knew it all.\n\nThis year has not been well with me job wise. The longest job I had this year lasted almost a year before I went to a production warehouse. That one was a complete farce as the ad stated it was nothing seasonal and it was like being in high school all over again. Never put that one in. \n\nHad been employeed for a couple of months for a brand new store in my area before I put in my two weeks notice for the law firm. I left there on good terms.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"jobs","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhnd","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Okay reddit, I got an interview this coming Wednesday and I need help in NOT messing this up.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/73irqx/okay_reddit_i_got_an_interview_this_coming/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

I'm fairly out of shape however, but I usually have little problems taking hikes (with frequent breaks).\n\nI use Alltrails and they list this as a hard trail, while many of the hikes I've done near me are listed as moderate (and are actually extremely dangerous), so I'm mainly concerned if I won't actually be able to complete this (whether it be due to tight spaces, or dangerous spots I may not be able to complete).\n\nI've found people joking about overweight people doing the full hike and that bringing plenty of water is the main concern.\n\nWould it be not feasible for me to potentially complete? We're dedicating a full day to this, so I imagine that taking frequent breaks would make this doable.\n\n\nAlso, are there any places nearby worth checking out?\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT:\n\n\nBecause someone asked,\n\nI'm out of shape because,\n\n* I was a smoker for 12-ish years. So I get out of breath pretty easily (but it's mainly on inclines). This generally is just resolved by stopping if I can't keep up with my breathing and just resting for a few minutes until it goes away.\n\n* I work in a white collar industry, so I'm not as active as I'd like. We try to hike every weekend at least and I've been attempting to get to the gym more frequently.\n\n* I'm not *that* fat, but definitely heavier compared to what I once was. At one point I was 185 pounds with 6% body fat. I'm 6'0 and 260 lbs, which I feel like I'm fat. It gives me motivation to say I am, but I'm not obese since you guys may need to worry about my 'dimensions' lol\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nWe aren't going this year, mainly because it seems like there are spots where I may have a hard time fitting. We'd rather not ruin our trip by trying to wedge me out from a drop and the fire side trail would be pointless to go up/down.\n\nWe'll probably come back next fall, by that time I should have the rest of my weight shedded and be good to go.\n\n\nFor people saying,\n\nFYI You're fat.

I broke up with my first girlfriend today. Obviously it was my first breakup too and so I'm having trouble sorting through my thoughts. For this post, I'll just call her Angie to keep her anonymous.\n\nA little background on me: I'm 18 years old, a freshman in college. I moved 2 hours away from my hometown to go to college. I first met Angie 3 years ago. We started dating a year after we met, and we were extremely close. Both of us were similar in that we had a small number of people who we considered friends. We told each other everything and did everything together. It was amazing being with her and she was the best girlfriend anyone could ask for (I truly mean that). \n\nUnfortunately, I think the worst side of me came out during our relationship. About half a year after we started dating, I started becoming someone I never thought I was. Before, I never considered myself a jealous person, but I started becoming jealous about everything, from the people she was hanging out with, to things she would do without me. I was becoming extremely petty and immature, and even though I tried not to be, somehow I could never fight against those feelings.\n\nOver the course of the past two years, even though I told Angie and myself I loved her, it started becoming more evident that it was a selfish love rather than a selfless love. She started building up resent for me and I could see it. I made her cry so many times, and in retrospect, I realize every time I made her cry, I became more calloused to her emotion. I just didn't care. Of course, I felt bad for making her cry, but not nearly like I should have. Not like a regular person would. Truthfully, I was abusing her. I would get mad at her for something, she would feel like it was her fault and she needed to change, I would feel bad and apologize, she would forgive me, and then it would repeat. It became a cycle of emotional abuse.\n\nAll the jealousy and fights over stupid things and resentment and abuse lead to today. It actually would've been our 2 year anniversary this Monday, October 2. I got really upset with her today and realized I was upset over a really petty thing. It finally dawned on me that our relationship couldn't continue. I'm bad for her and she deserves way better. I broke her heart so many times, and I should've felt bad about it but I didn't. This is where I'm worried. I'm two hours from home, I have no friends here, and I just separated from my best friend in the world. I feel like I should be crying or have some kind of emotional response but nothing is happening. I don't feel like I can ever date anyone again because I don't want to hurt, manipulate, and abuse them like I did Angie. I just feel empty inside. I don't know what to do.

I was diagnosed with TS, OCD, ADD at the age of 3. I had a rough time my entire school life due to TS, and I had to watch my mom and dad try to figure out how to handle the cards they were delt. Luckily I had a caring, loving family who did their absolute best to understand and try to do anything they could to make my life easier and more comfortable. So through the years you learn that TS is something that can be very frustrating and tough to handle mentally, and a lot of times physically. I am 28 now, married with a beautiful and loving wife, and 2 amazing, smart kids. My father passed away last year due to lung cancer, and this past year has been a very had one to deal with. It has been an emotional rollercoaster to put it mildly. With everything that has been going on in my life since my father passed, my TS has been at a very steady pace of frustrating, painful, annoying, and all around shitty. The first couple of months after my dad passed, I think I was more or less in shock because I don't really remember my TS flairing up too bad. Then I started to realize that I can't change the fact that my dad's gone, and my mom needs help around the house with even the most basic things, because she has had multiple back surgeries and has a hard time doing much for very long. On top of everything else I have 2 kids and a wife to take care of. The past two months or so have been brutal. I am at an all time high of stress, anxiety, and my TS is terrible. I have had shoulder shrugs so bad that my shoulders feel broken everytime I tic. My back and sides feel so bruised and my hide/legs are basically numb. I have been smoking devil's lettuce for about 12 years on a daily basis just to alleviate some of the daily stresses of life, and because well, I enjoy it, but even that doesn't take the edge off. I hope that maybe I can dig through some of these posts and find some suggestions for relaxation and try to calm my TS symptoms... anyway I am hopeful and happy that I found this sub, and am happy to be along for the journey and I think I have some valuable (to some) insight into this subject. \n\nSorry for such a long post, just needed somewhere to talk about something that I feel is kind of taboo in a way, and is hard to find a positive place to express what a lot of us deal with day to day. \n\ntl;dr hi.

This is my first proper reddit post and the first time I've ever shared something publicly but after reading through this sub I thought I'd make a contribution. A lot of the experiences posted in here seemed a bit extreme the first time I read them which I think steered me away from believing this issue affected me so if someone reads this and has their own realisation - great.\n\nAbout me - I'm 27, male, healthy and fit, have an excellent career, great family and an active social life. I am pretty much living the dream and have nothing to complain about. Up until a couple of months ago I was in a stable long term, long distance relationship with a girl who lived in a time zone 12 hours different to mine. It was challenging but we made it work - we were able to see each other fairly often thanks to my work.\n\nI've always been a sexually adventurous person with a large sexual appetite and have had no issues finding partners to sleep with. Since I was a teenager I have always used porn and considered it a healthy outlet for this part of me. \n\nPreviously when I had heard of porn addiction the image it conjured in my mind was a socially inept man, binge watching disturbing porn. This didn't fit the image I had of myself. I did watch a lot of porn but in my mind, this was just because I enjoyed sex so much. The porn I watched was never extreme (relative to my actual sex life) and I hated porn that I found even remotely abusive, non-consensual or exploitative. \n\nOver the last six or so months I was beginning to consider that maybe the amount I was consuming was affecting me but I found it easier to blame the symptoms I was experiencing on other factors. This was until the last time I went to see my ex-partner. During the time I spent with her I felt kind of numb, and didn't really enjoy the sex we had as much as normal. I wasn't there emotionally and grew tired of her company. This is at the point where our relationship when she was considering giving up on her dream career to come and live with me. When I got home I saw this as a sign of the relationship dying and called it off.\n\nIn the following months I came to the realisation that maybe porn wasn't helping me. I found it hard to meet new partners unless there was a guarantee that the encounter would end in sex. I learned how the instant access to dopamine porn gives you can destroy the normal response in your brain. I'm not going to say it was the cause of my problems but I think it was a factor and from what I've learned now I believe there is definitely an upper limit the amount of porn it is healthy to watch.\n\nThat leads me to where I am now. I want to make sure that my brain is working the way it's supposed to when I am with someone real. I don't want to feel like I need to move on to the next better thing. Whether or not porn was the cause of these issues for me I'm going to stop using it and see what happens. Seeing that his has worked for other people in this community I thought there's not point in trying to re-invent the wheel. I've decided to do the 90 day PM challenge which lines up with the end of the year nicely. I'm very disciplined in my general life but if it's not obvious already - I like sex. I don't expect this will be easy but I really hope that the potential benefits I see will become real.\n\nThanks for reading.

I'm now at a crossroads and am trying to decide on a career path.  I've always enjoyed computers and initially went to school for information systems, but dropped out quickly, then enrolled at a community college to quickly get an associate's degree in programming.  For some strange reason, I didn't work very hard to get a job right away when I first graduated back in 2013.  I guess it was sort of like I was postponing adulthood or something... I don't know....  I just moved back home when that happened, and always thought I wouldn't be able to find a job in that field in the small area I had grown up in.\n\nAnyway, I live in a rural area as you can tell where it's very hard to find a job as a programmer, but would be willing to relocate - even to a bigger city, I just don't think I could ever live in a massive tech/population hub area like in California or New York.  It's just not me.  My resume has no programming jobs on it, just an internship I did at the community college I went to, but I've been working on a game in Unity in my spare time and have a link to that on the resume.  I may be partial, but I think the stuff I've done is actually pretty impressive, especially the enemy AI that does some pretty nifty things.  All that said, I have a few questions and anyone taking time out to answer me would be doing me a huge favor.  Programming isn't my be-all end-all.  I've considered a lot of things like health care and the trades for example, but I don't think I would fit in with the \"salt-of-the-earth\" people that the trades attract, and I'm tired of all the \"sure-fire\" health care careers that I look into and find out that they've gone bust in my area because colleges pump out graduates (I think this has happened to ct/mri tech in my area, which was something I was really banking on).  So here are the questions:\n1) Anyone know much about programming/software development outside populated areas?  Is it still in demand in slightly less populated areas? Are the hiring criteria more or less stringent?\n\n2) You hear a lot of conflicting info about computer programming.  I've heard that if you can program your way out of a wet paper bag you can get a job, and also heard the exact opposite.\n\n3) If I've gone 3 or 4 years since graduating with no programming job, is that going to be a problem with me getting a job?  Any suggestions if so?\n\n4) Anyone know if it's even possible now to get a job with an associate's degree in this field?\n\n5) I don't have to work in computers.  I had a long-standing idea that I'd go into ct/mri tech at my local university.  I've heard the radiological sciences including sonography and ct/mri tech are more saturated than all the job articles let on.  For Christ sake though I need to figure something out.  Should I just throw caution to the wind and do that instead?  I'm sick of all the research ad nauseam!\n\nMany thanks.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"findapath","subreddit_id":"t5_2wqq6","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Programmer/Developer outside of major population hubs","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/73iz1o/programmerdeveloper_outside_of_major_population/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

It's a week long event and it has a parade on Sunday and events all week leading up to it. I'm 21 and have never missed the parade. I even went one year on a knee scooter because I'd had ankle surgery three days before. \n\n\nThis year I took the week off work(I don't live with my parents), drove to my hometown, and my mom told me that \"if I was good we'd go to the talent show and flee market and parade.\"\n\n\nWell. I went and spent hundreds of dollars on groceries for them, tons of errands cleaning, the like. No talent show because she didn't feel up to it. Ok no big deal. \n\n\nToday comes and it's the flee market. She said that she had a headache but could I drive half an hour away to go to a Fannie may store to get her some chocolates? I skip the flee market. All through this I had been getting invitations from my friends to go out drinking and having fun but my mom told me that if I did that then she wouldn't go to the parade with me. \n\n\nMy mom had broken ribs a few years ago and never recovered (she layed in bed for MONTHS) so she now walks with a walker at less than 50 years old. I mentioned to her that this would be her first parade with a walker so we may need to move our usual seat closer to the place with bathrooms and stuff to make it easier on her. \n\n\nBy me saying that she told my dad that I told her I was embarrassed of her (I am but would never say that) and ungrateful and hopefully I wasn't expecting to be reimbursed for the groceries (she promised me a check) and no way on gods green earth are we going to the parade tomorrow. My dad is legitimately not able to go from back and heart problems. \n\n\nI have a lot to say about my parents and my experiences but I'm not quite ready yet, but I'm comfortable telling this story. So my Saturday night is ruined because I said no to all my friends, if I want to go to the parade tomorrow (which again I have never missed) I have to go alone, and I just feel truly and utterly alone. \n\n\nI don't have any siblings to share this with. I live with my grandpa and there's only so much knowledge I can burden him with. I have the next week off as well and will still be with my parents (my grandpa is going to be in Florida and we live way out in the county in a big house so I get scared please don't judge) who just use and use and use me until there's nothing left. \n\n\nLike I said in a previous post which I deleted because I was embarrassed, I don't really know what I'm asking for here. Encouragement maybe? A place to vent? Someone to tell me I should be glad just to have parents? I understand why people kill themselves. But even as I say that I know ITS JUST A PARADE\n\n\nWHY AM I SO UPSET FOR SUCH A STUPID REASON!? I'm so angry at myself that I can't just be tougher and stop whining about not going to a damn parade. \n\n\nEdit: my friends are already all together hanging out downtown and drunk but here the parade is something you do with your family so it would be intruding to try and go with one of them to it even if they would love to have me. \n\n\nUpdate: watching Mulan and eating chocolates she forced me to buy her (I gave her hers) while crying like a little bitch.

I remember when I started high school I threw away all of my trophies, letters of recognition, drawings, etc..\n\n* I never take any pictures or videos of myself, and not because I think I'm ugly or anything like that (I know I'm not that good-looking, but neither me nor other people really give a shit).\n\n* I had social media in middle school but during high school I slowly faded out of it. Since then I haven't touched social media, or at least in the sense of having a public profile directly associated with my \"true\" identity (reddit is great! :)\n\n* I delete contacts from my phone when I think I won't talk to them for the next few months.\n\n* I keep my emotional distance from everybody I encounter. My actions and sentiments are genuine, no doubt, but I just never get attached to anybody. If for some reason I start to, internally I get a bit paranoid and try to \"stop caring\" about them.\n\n* Another weird but possibly unrelated thing about me - I try to avoid both high-highs and low-lows.

I hit my rock bottom with a family intervention and agreed to go to rehab. I guess you could have considered me a functional alcoholic and a newbie, but I have realized in my recovery that it doesn't matter \"how much of an alcoholic\" I was because I'm an alcoholic. I can't drink. Period.\n\nAnyway, I've become more comfortable in the fact that I'm an alcoholic. I've told my best friends and my immediate family knows. I'm not broadcasting the fact I had an issue or that I'm in recovery, but I'm not really trying to hide it. My husband's mom is an alcoholic and drug user, and she has left a lot of damage in her wake. She's done many things to indirectly and directly to her family.\n\nMy husband seemed to have a hard time separating our issues at first, but he knows I'm a different person therefor a different alcoholic. I want my father-in-law (divorced from mom) to know I went to rehab, so I won't have to lie to him. I had been going to AA Sunday nights, but now that a show we watch together is back on and will be through December, I'm not going.\nOh, I can go if I want, but my husband doesn't want him to know I'm an alcoholic. I understand given the bias many in his family have towards alcoholics. However, this means I would have to lie about where I am. He would definitely wonder why I wasn't watching our weekly ritual together anymore. \n\nI know I can go to a different meeting, but I haven't worked myself up to do that yet. I have a hard time doing new things. I still go twice a week but miss my Sunday nights.\n\nAny suggestions as to what I can do or some examples of similar situations? I want to respect my husband's wishes. I also don't want to lie and am comfortable confiding in him. FIL is very biased, but he's known me through my alcoholism and knows I'm \"different\" -- just doesn't know I'm an alcoholic.

I am 19, soon to be 20, and for most of my teenage years never really had a close, reliable group of friends. I like to blame it on how shy I was freshman year of high school, and I didn't get into a close friend group right away. I made some friends, hung out with some of them a few times, but never really found my place. I had lots of \"friends\" and acquaintances at school, and I never felt like people hated me, but I always felt like at the end of the day I would go home and have no plans with friends for weekends, holidays, etc. Eventually I made some good friends a year older than me, but they graduated the year before I did, so my senior year of high school was back to being lonely. I took a year off after high school to figure out what I wanted to do, which was an even lonelier time in my life, and I eventually chose music education as my major and I am now a month into college.\n\nMusic has always a part of my life, as my father is a choir director, and I grew up taking all sorts of lessons and being involved in choir and band. I don't like to call it an escape, as I think it doesn't do me any justice to refer to my passion as an \"escape\". It's like if someone calls your passion a \"hobby\" when you\u2019re really trying to make a life out of it. It just feels like an insult to myself.\n\nI like to think of myself as a likeable person. I participate in conversation well, I am knowledgeable to the point where I can hold a conversation with someone about almost anything, mostly because I accept when someone knows more about something than me and I like to ask questions in conversation and be engaged when speaking to people. I\u2019ve found it\u2019s easier to just act interested in something someone is passionate about and make them feel important and appreciated rather than act uninterested. After all, I wish this is how people would talk to me in conversation.\n\nI\u2019m only a month and a half into college, at a school where it\u2019s really difficult to meet people if you aren\u2019t involved in a frat or something (which I am not). I thought my old high school friends were exaggerating when they said it\u2019s hard to make friends when you\u2019re not in a fraternity. Turns out they were mostly right.\n\nThe only friends I\u2019ve made so far have only entered my life because I met them through an old high school choir friend of mine. They\u2019re cool, but I have the same problem I have with most of the friends I\u2019ve ever made in my life; they don\u2019t seem that interested in hanging out with me. I am almost always the one to initiate social time, and most of the time they either don\u2019t respond, say they\u2019re busy and hang out without me, or they say they want to hang out and then bail at the last minute.\n\nThis is what\u2019s always confused me. I thought things would change in college. I thought I would be able to find a group of friends that didn\u2019t do this all the time. I wanted to try and have a real group of friends that considered me just as much of a member of their circle as everyone else. But I still haven\u2019t found that yet. I understand it\u2019s only a month and a half into school, but I\u2019m getting lonelier and lonelier with every night I sit alone in my room listening to music and wishing I was doing something else.\nExhibit A is how I\u2019m sitting here on a Saturday night, listening to Led Zeppelin by myself, seeing people out doing things with each other, and wishing I had friends that would invite me to hang out with them, let alone respond to my texts.\n\nI have no idea what to do now. How do I find that close group of friends?\n\nSorry for the long wall of text. I feel like I might as well give you guys something to read, and maybe tell you a little more about myself since nobody else wants to hear about it.\n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"offmychest","subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I have no true friends","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/73j78q/i_have_no_true_friends/","whitelist_status":"house_only"}

I was wearing my moms black Run DMC t-shirt which was two sizes too big on me, I had on grey sweatpants that were baggy on me and I had on some blue converse and my hair was in a messy bun because I wanted to be comfortable so I wasn't really looking all that cute anywayssss on to the story.\n\nSo, there are workers in the halls working on the ceiling, it was two guys and one had just left to get something, which left me and this middle aged man with a braided ponytail and beer belly with a green muscle shirt way too tight for him alone, I politely said hi because I was raised with manners, he said hi and I entered the bathroom and that was that.\n\nI did my business, washed my hands, and was about to join my grandma in the waiting room, when the worker stops me and we started talking, our conversation went something like this\n\nMan: So, how old are you? \n\nMe: 14\n\nMan: Really?! You look so much younger( I'm 4'9 with a baby face, chubby cheeks, and an overbite so I get that a lot and wasn't really surprised at all)\n\nMe: (Laughs) I get that a lot\n\nMan: You're really pretty, do you have a boyfriend? \n\nAt this point I'm getting impatient and ready to go, and I'm always on the fence with strangers so I have my guard up already.\n\nMe: No sir, I have a girlfriend...I think I should go\n\nI try to walk away but he continues talking \n\nMan: Really?! You don't look like a lesbian\n\nI raised my eyebrow confused on what a lesbian was supposed to look like \n\nMe: Yeah\n\nMan: So, you've never tried dating a boy? I bet they chase after you, I mean you're beautiful and you have a great ass and boobs \n\nMy alarm bells go off, firstly I haven't developed my boobs that much and they aren't big at all, secondly I have on baggy sweatpants and a big t-shirt that covers my ass\n\nMe: Umm sir I'm 14, listen I really need to go\n\nI'm guessing he took notice of my cellphone and headphones because then he asked\n\nMan: That doesn't mean anything, Can I have your number? Your ma wouldn't know if we was on the phone since you've got them earphones \n\nMe: (angry) No, I'm not giving you my phone number, I've GOT TO GO \n\nI tried to get pass him but he grabs my arms and says \"If I wanna play little girl, I. Will. Play.\" Chills run down my spine and I hope someone comes down the hall, luckily a nurse and his boss came down and saw him, he let me go and I walked past him quickly but not before he leaves one final Creepy mark, putting his gross hands on my butt and squeezing, I wanted to throw up, I told my grandma and we're now looking into getting him fired\n\nSo, creepy old worker dude at the hospital who grabbed my ass....Let's never fucking meet again","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"LetsNotMeet","subreddit_id":"t5_2t3t8","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Creepy Hospital Worker Dude","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/73j80l/creepy_hospital_worker_dude/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw"}

Married, mid 30's, 3 kids, good job and such.  \n\nThe problem is that since I was a child I have dreamed, fantasized, whatever about being a girl.  My first times masturbating was pretending I was a girl.  Since I was a teen I would use anything I could find and put it in me to simulate the action of getting fucked like a girl.  As I got older I gravitated towards femdom porn, envisioning myself as a girl but also getting dominated by a girl.  \n\nFast forward to my current life, over the years these feelings just keep getting stronger and stronger.  At first I just thought it was a porn or kink thing, but I have seriously thought about transitioning for years.  If I had known now as a teenager I think I would have in high school if at all possible.  \n\nI guess what I am at now is that feeling of being trapped.  I have a wife I love and can't imagine being without, but she knows very little of this.  I have hinted over the years and have tried to guide some of our kinks towards this, but with no luck.  With my life and job I can't realistically fulfill my wishes, but I can't seem to shake what is increasingly becoming severe disgust with my body physically.\n\nI am rambling but posting this hear as a way to vent, and I apologize for it but it seems like a safe place.  \n\nI am thinking about trying to become more androgenous to see if maybe that helps.  I am 6' tall, fairly fit at 175lbs but with broad shoulders and a decent amount of body hair.  My testosterone is already low, with my doctor recommending me take more to compensate.  I am going to start a diet and try to lose 20lbs to \"feel better\" and see if that helps.  I have also made it very known to my wife that I hate my body hair and so I am going to try something to lessen this problem.  I think I am not going to take the extra testosterone and just stay low T, and am honestly thinking of doing some DIY low dosage of some sort to try and slightly feminize without becoming too noticeable.  \n\nMaybe this is a horrible idea, and I need someone who has been there to give me their 2 cents.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"asktransgender","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4b9","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Needing To Say Some Stuff Out Loud","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/73j9sc/needing_to_say_some_stuff_out_loud/","whitelist_status":"promo_specified"}

He's funny and takes great care of our family (my two sons and his two). I am 34 and a nurse, he is 39 and I'm mortgage business. We've lived together for 6+ months.\n\nHowever, we both have similar personalities and tempers. We are wonderful 90% of the time, but the moment he becomes stressed about work or his custody case with his ex, we usually end up fighting about something. I lost control yesterday and cleared all the items off of our dresser, breaking picture frames and creating a huge mess. He was trying to walk out of the room and I grabbed him by the shirt ordering him to come back and talk to me. He claims I hit him, and so that's why he threw a closed fist punch. I remember it as I grabbed his shirt and he swung around and wopped me in the side of the head, so I came back with both of my hands trying to hit him back. Regardless of who threw the first punch, he then pushed my head down and delivered 3 blows to the side of my face/ear/temple. My ear immediately began ringing. I was stunned and immediately began sobbing and stumbled to the bathroom worth my phone to call 911. He took this opportunity to get his keys and leave, but not before breaking the bathroom door off of the frame to tell me to \"get the fuck out of the bathroom\" and once he realized I was on the phone with 911 he began screaming that I was a psycho and I'm the one that hit him. He then left.\n\nThe police arrived and took pictures of my face and ear, of the broken glass and the broken door frame. He had also placed my 90lb German shepherd in my SUV without the car on and the police and I looked for him for 30 min before I realized he was in there. My fianc\u00e9 wouldn't answer the phone and then over text claimed he was only \"throwing my shit\" in my car and didn't do anything to my dog. The police have issued a warrant for him and he has ignored that fact since returning home.\nOn top of everything, I've been battling a horrible stomach bug all week, had a fever of 103 yesterday and was so weak and feeling terrible that I ended up in the ER for 6 hours receiving IV fluids and meds. \nHe came to the hospital to pick me up because I don't really have anyone here.\n\nI just. I feel like I'm rambling. I don't know what to do. He keeps denying he hit Me. Saying he won't tell his mother that he lied. He instead deflects and begins listing all of the things he determines are wrong with me. I am heartbroken and confused and scared and sad. I see a therapist weekly, I take meds for depression and anxiety and have worked with my therapist for years on my temper. He has none of the above. He drinks and acts out as his form of therapy.\n\nI truly don't know how to proceed. Do I let the sheriffs offc know he's here so they can come get his statement? \nDo I leave and go stay with my parents in another town? \nDo I stick by him despite his inability to admit any wrong doing and go to counseling with him? I told him I knew I lost control and how sorry I was etc. he hasn't done anything of the sort. I don't want to fail us or him. If he needs true help I don't want to peace out. \n\nAny advice or thoughts are appreciated :( \n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"domesticviolence","subreddit_id":"t5_2s2fr","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Terribly confused in Texas","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/73jbjb/terribly_confused_in_texas/","whitelist_status":null}

I am 18. I have a therapist, but she's always booked up, and I can rarely get in. I often don't feel like I can tell her the truth anyways. She's weirdly judgmental for a therapist. I'm on a high dosage of Prozac, and I take ADHD medication and birth control for incredibly bad periods.\n\nI tend to go through intense mood swings at random times, usually at night/in the evening. It's like I become an entirely different person. Sometimes I'm perfectly happy, and five seconds later, I'm angry or intensely sad or some other annoying emotion. Here's an example: I really love animals and I would never intentionally hurt one. I built cat houses for the feral cat colony living behind my apartment complex. I feed them and everything. But sometimes, my dog just makes me snap. He loves everything that isn't me, and I *hate* him for it. I was out walking him and he just ran up to everyone he could find. I told him that I hate him. He's not an empathetic dog, and I don't think he had any idea what I was trying to convey, but it's still a disgusting thing to do. I feel like such an awful person, but I think it was true at the time I said it. I hated my dog in that moment. I would never harbor any ill will towards any animal when I'm \"normal\". \n\nSome other things that make me snap are seeing women of the \"right size and shape\" glorified. It's stupid, but I hate my body and the way I look, so it really upsets me and makes me angry to even see someone who's attractive. Very fucked up. I can't really control myself when I'm in that state. I'm just overridden by emotions and I don't think the same way I usually do.\n\nIs it possible that I have something that goes a bit further than typical depression? I really feel like working towards some ideas of what's going on and nailing down some common themes would help me before I visit my psychiatrist for a formal diagnosis/analysis.

Our relationship was like any of the relationships I read about on here. The first 6 months or so  was complete bliss and I thought I had found the perfect one. After the first month or so she mentioned she was Bipolar Type II. I had no idea what that was truly at the time and did a few Google searches about it. Found out about the highs and lows. I thought I could help her by just loving her extra during these low points and enjoy the high points. This worked well for a while. Then after hanging out every weekend for several months she was concerned that we weren't spending enough time together. So we started to spend a few extra days a week together. Soon she starts sleeping over at my place. She asked at one point about 3-4 months into the relationship if she could move in. I said I wasn't comfortable with that yet but maybe after a year of dating or so. This was at what I assumed was a low point in regards to the Bipolar and didn't ever go over well with her. Eventually she started to leave a few things at my place every time she stayed. I still wasn't comfortable with it. She then had a very depressive episode and called me while I was at work saying she was having bad thoughts and was going to hurt herself. I was totally unaware of how to deal with something like this so I kept trying to cheer her up but nothing worked. She cut herself and had her friend take her to the hospital. They kept her overnight and checked her into a suicide watch place. We were texting before she was admitted to the suicide watch place and I basically had said I was sorry if I had done anything. She convinced the doctors she wasn't suicidal and was released the next day. Immediatly after getting out and grabbing a few things from where she was living, I picked her up and brought her to my place. I said she could stay there for as long as she needed and I'd keep an eye on her. I called in sick to one day of work, and she progessivly got better with each day. Things were great again. So great that I told her she could start to bring a few things over. Which she did as soon as she could. After living with me for about a month she told me she had BPD. Again I had no clue as to what this was entirely. I watched a few videos on YouTube about BPD and how they see everything in B&amp;W and thought I  knew everything about it. Then Bipolar. Never anything about dating something with BPD/Bipolar. Again I thought with enough love I could help her get better. Things went on fairly normal. High days. Low Days. Soon I wasn't spending enough time with her. I couldn't work on my laptop, without her feeling lonely. We took a trip to Santa Cruz one weekend and that made everything so much better. I had never seen her so happy and that made me happy. Things continued in a high state, then low state. But I had it all figured out. I thought I was in control. Soon she started pressuring to have kids. This was definitely something I was not comfortable with yet. And even though we were in the high state/ low state fluctuation, things were good but started to get worse. She stopped taking her medication saying it hurt her stomach. I thought she knew more about her illness than I did and shouldn't question her. I mentioned a few times I didn't think she should make that decision and that should be something her doctor decides. That brought up arguments. Things continued to get worse and she stopped therapy. I wasn't ok with that. Then we had a great few couple of days of bliss. Everything was perfect between us and we were both so happy. I started to do more research on BPD and stumbled on this sub. I started to read more and more. I realized I was being manipulated. But I was ok with it, because I thought I was a White knight and could save her if I just loved her enough. Things continued to get worse, she started accusing me of things I didn't do, things like not loving her enough, looking at other females, etc. I started to stand up for myself and say that these accusations were not true. Arguments continued for the last 3 days with me standing my ground. She was upset and went drinking. She came home and continued to accuse me of things I didn't do or irrational jealousy (jealous that I had talked to an ex-gf on the phone in front of her once during our whole relationship). She was yelling at me like she never had. She would yell and pace between rooms and then stop to yell in my face. I put walls up immediately and stopped showing emotions. I tried to stay totally calm and was sitting on the ground trying to have a rational conversation. Which was not happening. I felt as though I was being scolded. As soon as I would try to reply, she'd yell and accuse me of whatever it was she was upset at at the time. She jumped subjects rapidly after I proved how I wasn't in the wrong to something that she thought I had done wrong. She was upset I didn't say I was in a relationship with her on my Instagram. I said I use it mostly for my art so it'd be silly to post something like that (even though I had posted a giant portrait painting of her). She then threatened to go stay with someone for the night about 2 hours away. She started grabbing everything she had in the apartment and piled it by the front door. She started to throw a few bottles out of rage and broke a couple things. I asked her to stop. She continued. I asked her if she could stay the night at her mother's just 15 minutes away for the night. This triggered her more so and she went into a rage/fit I've never seen before. She continued storming through the apartment grabbing everything she owned and threw it at the front door all while making plans loudly to run off with her friend over the phone. She grabbed the kitchen knife and started cutting her wrists. I asked her to stop or I'd call the cops. This sent her off the deep end again. She started accusing me of not loving her. She said I never loved her. This hurt the most. I said that wasn't fair. She pointed to her wrists dripping with blood and clenched fists and screamed \"You did this to me!\" moments later realizing what she had done and screaming \"I don't cut myself!\". I was hurt and at a loss for words. I asked her if her mom could come pick her up because she was way too intoxicated and emotional to drive. She texted her mom to come pick her up. After continuing threats of suicide and my finger on dial for 911, her mom calls and is at the apartments. After 30 minutes of crying and screaming in the parking lot about how I don't love her and how she needs to go away, her mother was able to get her in the car and take her away. I was in shock and disbelief as to what had just happened. Was it all my fault? Was I not validating her emotions? Was I just trying to prove that I was right and started these arguments? I couldn't sleep. She stopped by the following morning with her mother to pick up some clothes. She was totally calm. Her mother asked if it was over. I said I was unsure. I was still processing what had happened the night before. I said we would talk this evening. We both said we wanted to talk it out but I said I needed time to gather my thoughts. She gave me a big hug and said I'm sorry. They left. I felt even more confused. I talked to my brother, he had experienced a relationship similar to this but not the same mental illnesses. He told me it's tough but it'd be best to cut and run. She texted me and said she wants to come home. I made an appointment to talk to a therapist online and am waiting. I told her we can talk after I talk to the therapist. \n\nI'm so confused and not sure what to feel. I miss her so much but I'm hurt by what she said and did last night. I feel it's somehow my fault even though I know it's not. I know logically I should just cut and run. But my emotions are telling me to stick with her through the shitty times to help her because I love her. I still have the White Knight mentality. My parents have been together for over 40 years and I have seen them work through the rough periods. Is this a rough period? Am I over reacting to what happened? I just want to help her. Is it possible to fix this? Does she not deserve love or to be in a relationship? She's been hurt so badly and I just want her to feel happy. She just texted me goodnight and I'm not sure if I should respond. This is so hard. This was my partner.

Like the title says, I'm the LL one in the relationship. My BF (M21) is very HL. We have only been dating for 8 months, but I've been pretty LL for as long as I can remember so I know it's not him. I know I'm really young, we're not married, and we've only been dating for 8 months so I feel pretty out of place here, but this is something that I have been beating myself up over pretty much ever since we first started dating. My sex drive was never strong to begin with, but it has been noticeably declining over the years. Now it's pretty much non-existent. I haven't actually felt \"turned on\" in over a year. Reminder that I am 21 years old. Yeah, there are probably 70 year olds that have higher sex drives than me. \n\nMy BF loves me VERY much and I love him, and he always tells me that even if we never had sex he would still want to be with me. To me, this is unacceptable. I see how much he wants to connect with me in that way, and it kills me that I don't have any passion for it. I want so badly for us to have a healthy sex life, but I have tried everything I can think of, and I'm at the end of my rope. Here is what hasn't worked, in order:\n- Wellbutrin (anti-depressant that is supposed to help sex drive too)\n- DHEA \n- DIM\n- Going off the pill and switching to an IUD (made me gain 15 lbs and have severe constant cramping for 4 months before I'd had enough. Paid $1,000+ out of pocket for it too bc insurance didn't cover.)\n- Cleansing myself of all hormones (no pill, no IUD)\n- Just forcing myself to take it (this makes me extremely depressed and resentful)\n- Taking sex off the table completely for a month (no talking about it, no sexual contact between the two of us) \n- Therapy, which I haven't really gone to enough to make a difference, but that is where I'm currently at\n\nTo make matters worse, after fucking with my hormones so much I am now 15 pounds heavier AND dealing with mild acne so of course I feel gross and undesirable even though he thinks I'm the sexiest thing on earth. \n\nAs you can see, I have been trying my hardest for him because I truly love him and his family and want our relationship to work. I can see myself marrying this guy, even though we have only been together for a short while. However, I'm getting to the point where I consider breaking up with him for his own good because he sees me as this golden angel when really I am a piece of shit GF. \n\nI have people telling me maybe I'm a lesbian, maybe I'm not attracted to my BF, maybe I'm asexual... These words hurt me. I don't want anyone else and I don't WANT to be asexual!!! I know what it's like to be turned on and want sex the handful of times I've felt it, and I want that to be consistent in my life. I want to have sex with my BF, but I can't. Hell, I don't even have the desire to masturbate. I don't ever think about sex outside of worrying about not having it. \n\nI don't really know what I'm looking for here, because I know most people on this sub are HL. I guess I just needed to rant, and I guess it's good to show you guys that there ARE LLs out there that care and want to make a change. But if anyone has any advice for me, PLEASE let me know!! Thank you guys for listening.\n\n*EDIT: Oh yeah I forgot to mention, I do have sex dreams relatively frequently, surprisingly. In my dreams, I'm actually turned on and feel the strong desire to have sex. In real life though, nothing. I always wonder if it means something.

It started in elementary, when I was very isolated from bullying and having few friends.  At first there were four, male friends, soon joined by a girl.  I enjoyed music a lot (still do), so we formed a band in my head and \"played\" for the school in concerts after school; of course, everyone loved us!\n\nMore and more people joined our entourage as the years went, and several left as time went on too.  Several I haven't seen in years, but they're still out there somewhere in the deepest reaches of my mind.
