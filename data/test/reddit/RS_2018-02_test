I'm 5'11\", somewhere between 200-215 lbs. With between 25-30% body fat\n\nI've never cut before, I always had horrible diet when working out, it didn't prevent me from getting strong but it would drain me. My current diet is not eating all day then ordering out at night, that's not a good diet and I know it.\n\nThe problem is, I do TA work from a lab on my campus from 7:30-10:30 on Mon, Tues, and Thursday nights. By the time I get home it's 11 pm, and I plan on working out in the morning (around 6-7 am, as I have classes mostly from afternoon to night so this is my only good time). This leaves me about 8 hours of sleep on 3 of the 5 days a week I'd be working out, if I don't do anything else when I get home. This is normally why I order out now, because it's fast and I can still get some sleep.\n\nThere's also the fact that most days I have class during noon, so lunch is hard to get in, and I usually just buy a bag of chips. Again, bad, I know.\n\nSo my idea was on the weekends to cook big pots or Hodge podge's of food that will last me the week. This made sense to me because I can take time to prepare food that I'd like and that's healthy on Sunday, and then Monday through Friday just heat them up for meals.\n\nMy only problem is this program seems pretty intense, I've been out of lifting for a year or so and honestly I have never done a true cut (I regret wrestling in high school purely because it screwed my diet so much that I was never able to get a good bulk or cut routine going). I was looking for some advice specific to my situation, how to structure my eating habits and what's a good deficit to go on for this program with my bf %. Realistically I would like to keep cutting until fall, I wanna lose enough to get my BF% in the low teens. I'm sure this is realistic enough by fall, but then again I'm not sure. My goal is to get to that point, so I can run a true bulk and get my muscle back.\n\nThanks","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Fitness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhx4","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"How to run a cut around my schedule","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7uekjd/how_to_run_a_cut_around_my_schedule/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

Basically, I am a 27 year old man who lives with his parents.  My parents have always been extremely overprotective, and for the past ~4 years since I graduated I've been somewhat taking advantage of that by living at home for cheap and saving money (FWIW I pay them rent, I'm not just a leech).  I am looking to buy a house and move out on my own, but I'm trying to create a budget so that I do this in an informed way.  \n\nThe problem, and the embarrassing part... is that I literally have no idea what shit costs.  I'm 27 years old and I've never once paid a utilities bill.  I do grocery shopping but it all gets intermingled with the rest of the food in the house so I really can't gauge how much it costs me to eat every month.   All I know is my credit card bill, which is essentially nothing.  I don't want my parents to know what I'm doing yet because they're probably going to take it pretty hard that I want to move out, and I want to have a real plan so that I can lay it out and explain.  Therein lies my problem; I can neither ask them nor act weird to try to do all this shit separately/myself for a month or two.  \n\nIs there any way I can get some reliable ballpark numbers for some of these expenses for my area?  I've googled a lot of stuff but I just don't know which numbers to trust.

The work makes me miserable but they pay more than minimum wage and are very flexible. This allows me to be able to help out my mom with getting my sister to and from school (as the school she goes to doesn't have conventional hours), and continue the only internship I've ever had (and was miraculously able to get being a college grad already). My issue is that the call center job while well paying is emotionally draining and I leave feeling sad and tired, pumping myself up to go in doesn't work anymore and I've only been back a month after failing to find any job that paid a similar wage. If possible can anyone advise me on ways to better cope/handle working at this job for the foreseeable future (until August), or on where I can possibly find a similarly flexible (non-Uber) job? The reason I can't leave the job until August is that my family is planning a vacation (I know, I know, but family trips and time is very important to me, we are a very close family), and most jobs don't allow employees to take vacation unless they've been at a company for at least three months and have good standing. The bright side is that my sister graduates early, in December so I at the most have to remain flexible until then.\n\nAlso, any advice on how to break into the Museum/Archive field with little to no internship experience, and no graduate degree would be much appreciated.

I'm 23 and we recently got this new 15-year-old worker. She's been annoying the crap out of everyone due to her poor work ethic. But I'm a friendly laid-back guy who gels with pretty much anyone. \n\nTo be clear: I've had no issue talking to her at work and just being friendly. But she's very hard to handle and overly dramatic (this isn't just with me). But despite this everyone would joke that they think she has a bit of a crush on me. \n\nThen comes NYE. I come back from a party at 3 AM and receive a text from this 15-year-old girl -- declaring her love for me. She was drunk clearly (despite being 15). I thought she was just being friendly at first like how people can sometimes be because it literally came out of nowhere. But then she goes *''No, Oliver, I'm in love with you. I dream about you every night''*. \n\n\nI was too drunk to deal with this so I went to bed. But she'll come into work as a customer on her days off with her friends (and say she came in hoping I'd be there). Or that her friends think I'm hot. \n\nIf this were someone around my age I could at least just laugh it off, but this is just an awkward position for me to be in. So the other week I took her out back away from the customers and explained to her that I'm 23 and she's 15 and that I'm not interested and she should stop flirting with me and stop sending me texts. (I tried to be as nice about it as possible) but clearly this was hard for her to hear. Her eyes welled up with tears and she stormed out. \n\nTough but necessary... \n\nSo far things have been good. She has stopped texting and she has stopped flirting with me at work. But she is going overboard now. The other day she found out she was rostered on with me and refused to work if I was working, so my manager had to place her in a separate department. \n\nAside from that, since I've burst her bubble, she's no longer stopped looking forward to work so her work ethic is declining again and it is pissing everyone off. Our manager said she's going to permanently relocate her (but she's said this in the past and nothing happened). \n\nSo far nothing bad has happened, but I told an older mother/grandmother about the whole ordeal (who I trust greatly). She told her daughter (who I am also friends with). \n\nAnd today I got a text from her middle-aged daughter. Despite everything seeming like it's sorted itself out, she has been recommending I speak to a higher-up about it (not our department manager). To cover myself just in case this girl tries to ''put it back on me''. \n\nI'm not really against this, but the only higher-up that's in our store lately is extremely condescending. And I'd rather not make a big deal out of it to her. I really have no idea if I should bother bringing it up with her, and if I do, how I should go about it?...\n\n*''Hey Shannon, I've been getting hit on by one of your underaged employees.

I guess my title the first time broke the rules? \n\n----\n\nI have very few memories from before I was 13. I'd equate my post-teen memory to that of cell reception when driving through the desert; extremely spotty, at best. What I do know is that I was an a-hole chubby kid with piss poor attitude. Up until now, I had attended a private charter school from the 2nd grade, and that I was a fairly creative, yet hyper kid. By the time I reached 15 years old though, I was kicked out of the charter school, and sent to public school.\n\n\nI was never a great student at the charter school from what I recall. The school tested two+ grades ahead of the public schools in the district, and I was always two+ levels below them. Even after transferring to public school, my grades continue to fall. Already being portly and borderline depressed, my waste continued to grow throughout my freshman year of high school.\n\n\nThe summer of that age(14) I picked up a job working at the church my mom managed, maintaining the campus grounds. One early morning on my way to work though, I was hit by a car. Immediately heli-vacced to Loma Linda Medical University, I was rushed into surgery. From the outside it appeared as though I had nothing more than a few scratches, but my MRI and CT scans showed that I had intense brain swelling.\n\n\nFrom what I've been told, during surgery I went into shock, and my heart stopped for a total of seven minutes (I guess you could say I died). With my brain in shock and my heart stopped, my body reacted by falling into a coma - a state where I would remain for just over one month. This all occurred in the first week of August, 2001. As I'm writing this now, it's apparent that I eventually woke from my coma, and began the slow path to recovery. One thing that sucked - not as much as a coma sucks - is that I missed my 15th birthday party because of this damn coma...and my family ate all my cake \"in my honor\" (liars).\n\n\nLet me tell you, there's nothing quite like waking up from a month-long coma after celebrating my birthday with a catheter in my pecker and a tube down my throat...and no cake! Now fifteen, I'd been awake for about a week and a half. This day is really the first VIVID memory I have of the first fifteen years of my life, and I remember it for a very specific reason.\n\n\nAs I wheeled myself out of my hospital room's bathroom back to my bed, I remember looking into the hall and seeing all the nurses and patients looking at the television with horrified looks on their faces, as though they had just seen... an airplane strike a building. Because they did. I glanced up at the TV in my room, which I remember had been playing Ren &amp; Stimpy before I went to pee, now had a live feed from Manhattan. The first plane had just struck the WTC, and right as I could realize what was going on in my already-foggy mind, the second plane struck the second tower.\n\n\nThis is my first real memory.\n\n\nA few weeks later I left the hospital with a massive chip on my shoulder, and started what would be a long and windy road of lot of downs and very few ups. For the next few years I would be go through a half-dozen psychologist and psychiatrist, counselors and therapists. Remember how I told you I was a portly boy a while ago, though? The one good thing that came from that accident, was that I lost 75 pounds while I was in my coma. Hindsight is 50/50, I guess.\n\n\nThe first year of recovery was the hardest, and I had to have a specialist homeschool me for my sophomore year. I vaguely remember maybe two or three memories from this whole year, but I eventually went back to public school starting in my junior year.\n\n\nDepression, erratic mood disorders, violent and uncontrollable behavior came in full swing, as my traumatic brain injury (TBI) was taking the best on me. I thankfully had the support of my immediate family (nobody else knew how to deal with me). To cope with the depression, I did what any self-destructive adolescent boy does - I ate the shit out of everything in sight, and neglected to do my homework. As my grades continued to fall and my waste continued to grow, I had already put on any weight I had lost prior to my accident, with the unwelcome addition of about a hundred more pounds. Not seeing the point of it all, and clearly still not able to cope with the struggles of post-TBI life, I attempted suicide for the first time. Thankfully the belt snapped.\n\n\nBy the time I reached seventeen or so, my depression had grown exponentially. All the post-traumatic psychiatric help that I had received in years prior had gone out the window, and I was as self-destructive as ever. Knowing how much I was breaking my mothers heart - the woman who had pushed me forward when I always pulled back, I was determined to do SOMETHING right, and so throughout my junior year and senior years, I managed to kick ass at learning, and wound up eventually graduating with a 4.0 GPA.\n\n\nAll the kings grades and all the kings kit kats couldn't keep humpty-bumpty Bryan's depression away though. Completely alone through this first post-high school summer, my loneliness took a toll on me. I was fighting with my parents and punching holes in walls faster than a woodpecker pecks, and I knew I was causing more harm than good. I once again attempted suicide by attempting to drown myself by wearing a backpack full of bricks in my pool. Yet again, the universe said \"not now\", and the straps broke on the backpack (say's a lot about that Dollar-Store Jansport knockoff).\n\n\nFor the next few years I went between competitively sucking at playing video games, eating whole pizzas, downing the Dew, and just basically not doing a damn thing with my life. Sometime in this time-span my parents kicked me out, and with no other place to go, I slept in my truck for a number of weeks. Eventually though, I reconciled my relationships with my parents, moved in with my sister just a few miles away, and started taking classes at Mount San Jacinto community college. While I was excelling at doing the bare-minimum, I still wasn't making any friends, nor was I losing any weight.\n\n\nOver summer break I ballooned from around 250 lbs to 310 lbs, and my depression escalated even faster than ever. Following an argument I had with my sister over something stupid I probably said or did, and again having thoughts of \"this shit aint worth it\", I attempted suicide a third, and final time, by swallowing a bottle of my migraine pills.\n\n\nSometime after swallowing about fifteen pills in a thirty-second time-span, something clicked in my head. Laying on the floor in my bedroom, thinking this is finally going to be it, I realized \"HOLY SHIT, I am fucking SELFISH, and this is going to RUIN my sisters life!\" So I got up, ran into the bathroom, purged for a solid ten minutes, and took a very very deep fifteen-hour nap.\n\n\nAnd then I woke up.\n\n\nRealizing the harm I was causing not only in my own life, but the lives of the people who had worked so hard to help me recover, I made the decision for myself that I would actually try matching the effort that everybody else put in for me.\n\n\nI left the community college and enrolled and started attending art school in San Diego. My grades were pretty average at first, but my attitude and depression started improving for the first time in my post-accident life. I cut myself cold turkey from all prescription antidepressants and anti anxiety medications that I was on (something like five prescriptions at once). My weight had still been on the incline through all this though, and eventually I reached 386 lbs. Realizing that my new-found love for life wasn't matching my caloric intake, I finally decided to take a bold move, and had gastric bypass surgery in April of 2007.\n\n\nA year to the date after my surgery, I weighed 165 lbs, losing 220lbs in a 1-year time-span. My grades started really taking off too, and after winning a number of design competitions and becoming the \"Spotlight Student\" at my art school, I graduated with a 3.7GPA, and a great direction for a career in advertising. I event made a few friends that I still have today! After graduating college, I toured around Europe for about 7 weeks, and started making some of the best memories I have still to this day.\n\n\nShortly after returning from my trip, I started freelancing to pick up as much work as I could. I did my work from a Starbucks in my town on the daily, where I continued to grow socially, meet new people, and learn how to live with my many shortcomings that were a result of my accident. One day in late May of that year, I saw this foxy lady in the reflection of a window at the Starbucks I worked from. A few weeks later, I finally said hello to her, beginning a beautiful adventure with the most beautiful young woman I had ever met.\n\n\nWith my chin up high and forward momentum, I dove head-first into everything I could. In 2011 I won Attack of The Show's national \"Attack of The Art Show\" contest, and was featured on a segment on their live broadcast. By the time I turned 25, I had also landed a job as a photography and design instructor at the same junior college I dropped out of just seven years earlier.\n\n\nThe connections I was making just simply by doing my design work in the public space of Starbucks led me to a ton of leads, and brought me opportunities to work with and for some large touring bands. This in turn eventually led to me landing a number of jobs as unit-stills photographer for a number of major motion pictures, and international brands.\n\n\nAt the age of twenty-seven I discovered legal weed \ud83d\ude0f. I also landed my first real job as the creative director for a German company called Tronical. I was meeting new people left and right, kicking ass and taking names, going to awesome music-industry trade shows with all-expenses paid... until they weren't. One day I received an email saying I was being let go. To make a short-story-turned-long-story-turned-short, this company stole roughly $40,000 from me in withheld salary and unpaid expenses.\n\n\nI'd been through worse, but never anything this financially burdensome. Knowing that this wasn't my first time being screwed over, and it surely wouldn't be the last, I pressed onward.\n\n\nFast forward a few years to thirty, I'd managed to keep most of the weight off, I'm still teaching courses at the junior college, and finally appreciating what life is, and yes, I put a ring on it.\n\n\nAt this point my life was better every day than the day before. Don't get me wrong, I still had money struggles, career instability (I was working at a startup that would eventually fold), but my love and I had moved in together and begun a new act in life that was to introduce a whole basket of new challenges and blessings.\n\n\nThis brings us to the present. I'm 31, FINALLY free of that anchor of the stolen $40,000. Naturally though, when one blaze that goes out, another is sure to arise. I had to have surgery unexpectedly mid-year last year, but I know I'll get through those bills. These bills don't keep me up at night any more though, and any pain or suffering I may face, only helps build me up, and no longer tears me down.\n\n\nI'm realizing now that I have a strange multi-level perspective that makes for an interesting bar story. I've died, had a taste of homelessness, attempted to kill myself numerous times, felt what it's like to not be able to fit into an airplanes seat, been completely alone, and literally failed at everything I would try.\n\n\nBut I also lived, found shelter in my family, felt the pull of the universe towards something greater, lost a dramatic amount of weight, met the other half of my heart, and found great success in both winning AND losing. Now I'm just trying to find out why I was given so many 'second chances.'\n\n\nI still struggle with depression, but it no longer controls me or my actions. I feel like I was kept alive to help others pull through similar struggles in regards to suicide, obesity, poor education habits, etc... Now I'm just waiting for that opportunity, and appreciating life every step of the way! \n\nAs cliche as it may sound, the point I'm trying to get across with this, is that we should not take our opportunities at new beginnings for granted. If you stub your toe, move the table. If a friend betrays you, look for those signs in other people to avoid the same betrayal again. If fail at suicide, take it as a sign that you were not meant to go yet. \n\nNo matter the challenges life sets in our way, we have to make the conscientious decision to observe them either as roadblocks, or as lessons of what to do or not to do in the future. Look at each hurdle as something you *get* to learn how to jump over, not something that is an obstacle in your way. You will fail, over and over and over and over again. I promise you this. But **when** you get back up, you will from here on out, see those failures as mere experiences, that taught you how to be a better you. \n\n**TL;DR:** Try, fail, learn, get up, keep going.\n\n\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"GetMotivated","subreddit_id":"t5_2rmfx","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[Story] Try, Fail, Learn, Get Up, And Keep Going.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/7ueqzh/story_try_fail_learn_get_up_and_keep_going/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

Somewhere around all that. I'm 15 now so I can't just say it happened so many years ago and brush it off like it's nothing. For reasons unknown to me, I've always had a fetish for incest, ever since I was around that age. One one occasion I'd asked her to have sex with me, to which she denied (thank god). I had a major sexual attraction to her and I couldn't help it or I was too stupid to. So I showed her porn one day, and asked her if I could.. y'know, start. She didn't mind, or said so. (Thinking back, there's no way she'd be okay with that and I probably messed her up bad). I had placed a pillow next to me and her but intentionally in a way she could see it. It was terrible. I did it again when it was dark, and I was off in a corner on the computer. I don't remember too clearly how this happened but she was just laying in bed and I was really horny. So I started again. I think some part of me thought she'd find it hot and come assist. A lack of restriction and the knowledge of porn at a very young age has warped me or something. More recently, about a year ago, I'd masturbated with her bra, which I later discarded, taken photos of her butt as she laid down without her knowledge, and hidden a phone in the bathroom to record her showering once. Thankfully she almost caught me the second time around when she noticed it propped up. I snatched it before she could see it was recording.. I've apologized to her for everything so many times and she's forgiven me every single time but I can't help but feel that I'm a bad person in her head. I'm definitely one in my own. I feel like such an awful person and I can't live with myself knowing I've done all this. I've gotten help, never really mentioned any of this to a professional though, but I was sent to a mental school thing for a few mental illnesses they were allowed to tell me I had, depression, anxiety, etc. Pretty sure there are a few more screws knocked loose up there but who knows, I'm not trying to justify myself.\n\nI just really needed to get this off my chest and get some input because I'm afraid to tell anyone face to face, other than like two people I was in a relationship with but that doesn't matter.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"confession","subreddit_id":"t5_2qo2a","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[Remorse] I've practically sexually harassed my cousin when I was younger and it still eats me alive.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/7ueres/remorse_ive_practically_sexually_harassed_my/","whitelist_status":"promo_specified"}

I have a rare genetic disorder called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. It's a connective tissue disorder which effects my joints, eyes, skin, digestive system, and how medication affects me. For most medications, I have to take a much smaller dosage, except anesthesia. With anesthesia, I require more than the recommended dosage and it often takes longer to take effect. \n\n\nI've had 17 surgeries and I always make sure the anesthesiologist knows about my EDS and my reactions to anesthesiology. There's been a few times when I've been awake and aware during surgery and told the anesthesiologist and they've quickly remedied the situation.\n\n\nBecause of my EDS, I developed subcapsular cataracts in both eyes. I'm 46 and just had my second cataract surgery. My first one was in 2015 and was a breeze. My doctor was well versed in how to handle my condition. Other than feeling the needle for the retrobulbar block, I remember nothing from that surgery. \n\n\nIn October of 2016, my vision in my right eye became cloudy and I knew it was time to get my cataract removed. I called the original doctor who did my first surgery, only to be told that he had retired and the new doctor didn't take my insurance. They suggested I call my insurance for a referral, who referred me to a local cataract surgeon.\n\n\nI went for my consult, explained Ehlers Danlos Syndrome to him. He told me that he was familiar with EDS and that he would make sure I was comfortable. I told him about my experience with the retrobulbar block and he told me that he didn't feel that it would be necessary, that he'd use lidocaine drops and twilight me. I told him that I was very resistant to lidocaine and usually required 5-6 times the usual dosage. He said he was confident that they could keep me comfortable. They scheduled me for surgery the 27th of December.\n\n\nWhen I arrived at the surgery center, they took me back to the preop area. I met with the nurse, who went over everything, including my EDS. I then met with the anesthesiologist and the nurse anesthetist. We went over the procedure and my EDS. I explained to them my reaction to anesthesia and how much lidocaine I usually need when getting dental work. They both said they were confident they could keep me comfortable. The anesthesiologist said he'd have things ready to completely put me under, but felt that wouldn't be necessary. We discussed the meds he'd be using (lidocaine drops and ketamine) and asked if I'd had any adverse reactions to either of them, other than needing a higher dosage. After that, they took me into the operating room. \n\n\nWhile they were prepping me, the nurse anesthetist asked me how I was feeling. I told her a little on edge, so she said she'd give me something to relax me. She pushed something in my IV and I waited... and waited... and waited... nothing. As they were draping my face, I told them that I still was on edge and she said that they were getting ready to give me the anesthesia and that I'd soon be \"very very relaxed\". I felt the burn of the anesthesia going in, but I didn't relax, I didn't feel any different. The doctor came in and I told him I was still awake and aware. He told me that I might feel that way, but that I wouldn't remember a thing. He then started surgery. It was excruciating. I kept telling them over and over that I wasn't comfortable. The anesthesiologist kept pushing drugs, even propofol. In spite of my pleading for him to stop and get me comfortable, the doctor continued. By the end of the surgery I was sobbing. When I was to my breaking point, the doctor said \"One more minute and you'll be done. I'm putting in the lens.\" At that moment, I felt as if someone was shoving a fork in my eye and then pulling my eye out of my head. I must have passed out for a few minutes because the next thing I remember is being wheeled into recovery.\n\n\nAs soon as they got me into recovery, the room filled up quickly. The director of the surgery center, the nurse anesthetist, the anesthesiologist, and several other people were in the room. (But not my doctor). The director of the surgery center was profusely apologizing with a print off from the internet in her hand about Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, telling me that they'd use this as an educational experience and how that my case would be up for review. The anesthesiologist and nurse anesthetist were in there going over the amount of meds they gave me and how they tried to get my comfortable. I asked why they didn't just stop and get me comfortable or knock me out. The anesthesiologist said that the doctor wouldn't stop and allow them to get me comfortable. At that point, my doctor popped his head in and said he'd see me the following day for my follow up. I was sobbing at this point and I asked him why he didn't stop and allow the anesthesiologist to get me comfortable. He said that it was because the globe of my eye was open and it would have been dangerous to leave it open. He acted surprised that I was so upset. I think he honestly thought I would forget what he'd done. The surgery center director apologized again and they sent me home. On the way home, the drugs all finally kicked in and I slept most of the rest of the day.\n\n\nThe following day, my daughter (who is pre-med) took me to my appointment. I was a nervous wreck on the way there, in the waiting room, and in the office. His nurse took care of most of my visit, other than the doctor peeking his head in. I tried to ask him about the surgery, but he was out the door. I scheduled for my two week follow up and left.\n\nThe morning of my two week follow up, the office called and said that the doctor wouldn't be in and rescheduled it for a week later. At that appointment, the same thing happened, the nurse took care of me and he popped his head in and talked to her and told her to reschedule me in two more weeks.\n\nThat appointment was supposed to be today. This morning the office called and rescheduled me for February 16th. I don't know if I will be going to that appointment.\n\nEvery night since surgery, I've had horrible dreams, replaying the surgery. Even when the dreams aren't about the surgery, I have nightmares about someone ripping my eye out of my head with a fork. I'm sleeping less and less, waking up in the middle of the night in a panic. I've also started having panic attacks at random times during the day. I've scheduled an appointment with my general practitioner to discuss what happened and to possibly get medication for my panic attacks and to help me sleep.\n\nSorry this ended up so long, but any advice would be appreciated.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"legaladvice","subreddit_id":"t5_2rawz","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"OHIO - Was awake, aware, and in pain during surgery.

And yes, there are men in that age group, who approach me for different reasons - but it is like with every other person, we are not always a match.\n\nI should have what to offer - I did buy my first house just now, i am a lead engineer in my job ( i am working in the field 7 years now ), i make contacts easily, because i am friendly and helpful. I am caring, by the looks of men around i can tell i am the attractive young woman in the room. I am rational and in control of all that I need to get done, but in the end of the day i am a woman , and outside of work i am being in my feminine way. Unless i need to get something done, then again i flip the coin.\n\nI would have children, it is not something i insist on doing, but with the man i feel it, i would have them.\n\nNow, i think what i am failing at, is that i think all the above makes me attractive to men. But i think it is not.\n\nI have young men wanting to be with me. But physically i cannot make it. I would love to be with one of them, but i just cannot feel this way. And i do not think it is fair to neglect the sex and make them feel unwanted, or forcing myself to have sex if i don't want to.\n\nOlder men - they are always happy to see me and to have a nice chat - but they have their relationships, and noone sane will leave their girlfriends ( because i can see that people now are mostly divorced and living with another partner ). Even if they are alone, i do not think that they would go for me, because i feel like i am lacking something they need. So i am generally afraid when a single man approaches me. I prefer to approach.\n\nI will list a few issues I think i have:\n- although i lead a mature life, i still look too young and too girly - i am quite short, and - i would wear a green, or rose pink, or white shirts, scarfs, knee-long skirts or dresses. So you will only see me in gray trousers and a white shirt, if the shirt has a ribbon or if i put a scarf. But i want still to feel young and girly, i don't want to go full robot. Funny enough, at work I have never been discriminated for how i look. I get my hands dirty whenever the work has to be done.\n\n- Another issue I have is that i am working too much, and if i am not working, i am focused on - work/learning for work, the car, the house, family, money, food, sport/appearance - whatever it is that it would improve my life.\nI do travel and i do go out sometimes - but i go out only where i enjoy to do so, only at the times i would enjoy to do so. I do not particularly enjoy meeting new people, because i am constantly in touch with people at work, so i need my space outside of it.\n\n- i cannot be with a man who made the first move. automatically lifts a barrier, i just can't do it. I can only do it, if i have approached the man first and he has responded. I still have no idea why I am like that. It feels a bit like this was it is me having the control - so he cannot come and use me\n\n- i cannot be with a man who i haven't met few months back - or if not, then he has to be from my social circle - because i have done that - and I do not know these people and I only discover their behavior patterns after a few weeks-months\n\n- i am a bit cynical like whole, i like individuals, but i dislike humanity, in a nutshell .I do not trust words, but that is fine ( people sometimes even themselves do not know that what they are saying is not true ) , when i have someone around who i can see is consistent - then i get something like a pseudo trust - so we become a team and i will cover his back, and he can rely on me.\n\n-at first i think people get fooled by my cheerfulness , and they expect my personal life is dynamic, but then i might appear boring, my life has made me tired and in my free time i can spend easily 1h choosing what tea to buy in a tea house, then 2 hours for finding new cups, then 1h hour more to buy milk and look at the food in the grocery store and pick something fresh, then go back home , make some tea, invite someone over and maybe tell him what i've read in wikipedia about black tea, and spend the rest of the time interested in his day/life. I love inviting people home for a tea, also inviting them for a lunch/dinner ( salad with fish/meat, that's all that i like cooking ). I love giving attention to the man i like, i love being affectionate.\n\n- i am sensitive and emotional, but these emotions get buried somewhere, i postpone expressing them till i get things finished ( even in a conflict, or if someone makes me feel bad, i ignore them and try to stay rational ). I feel guilty of every spontaneous expression of emotion - i feel too young automatically when i do it, and that puts me in a weak position.\nBut you can imagine these emotions try to manifest themselves, so you will see me doing something in secret for 2-3 months, fueled by all these \"secret\" emotions - for example moving in to another country, buying the house, doing qualification exams, all done hiding. To fight back some imaginary resistance, or god knows what. Also sometimes I am not so nice, and if someone repeatedly did something to me, i say nothing, then if i get the chance, i return the favor. Because in my childhood ( and even later in life ! ) i have learned that words do not help, and noone will listen to reasoning, so sometimes i do not have the patience explaining things. But OK. I think of myself as reasonable and fair during most of the time.\n\n- i am not the sharing type, because it tires me people to listen people's reactions, because i do push some boundaries. i share mostly post-factum.\n\nSo sometimes i feel like i have some deep issue and i lack something, and it is why men i like do not like me back. I feel like they think i am not worthy the effort. Even if i am helpful and put effort;\n\nOther days, i think my life has changed too much for a short time span, and i cannot expect it to happen now, it will take some time. Because of the challenge of my age, because i am young.\n\nI don't know, it just feels sad to be alone, and that comes from an active person.\n\nI have listed some issues that i think i have, but i want to hear more, because i want to learn what i can't see, otherwise i cannot work on fixing it. I will be grateful for all the help. I think my issue is not that i like older men, i think my issue is general.\n\nAnd generally , i do not have issues with people, i have many people who are close to me and I am their friend, i help them when i can, they like my company -  but there is no reciprocation - i prefer to be alone, and to be fair, i always at a given time have 2-3 people ( + my parents also ) with who i can be myself, and feel happy with myself, but generally i feel like hiding myself too much.\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I am young, i like older men, but i am struggling to find a partner - but unsure if it is not a more general issue","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationships","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Me [24F] having unrealistic expectations of a partner and relationships, therefore not having one - or is it so ?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7uesg4/me_24f_having_unrealistic_expectations_of_a/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

I am 24 years old (just graduated college last summer). I found a job fairly quickly making ~50k. It was about two weeks into looking for a job, and I didn't want to squander the opportunity, and I scowled at the idea of being unemployed (by choice that is). But after being at the job 4 months, I am completely bored and unmotivated. I get my job done, but all I do is sit at a computer all day and serve as a drone. If it weren't for the extremely nice people and good company, I would have possibly quit already. But I wanted to try to stick it out at least 6 months before I left. But I now want to leave as soon as I can find another job.\nI'm looking for a job that challenges me, and preferably has a team environment, such as working on projects. I can't stand doing the same thing all day, especially while sitting at a computer. I want to work in a dynamic environment where failure happens and it's encouraged so that learning can happen. Passion is really important to me; even if I'm not passionate about the job, I'd really love to be around others who were. \nI'm looking for any advice as to where to go or maybe some skills to learn to improve my opportunities to find work that this describes. \nI possess very eclectic interests, so I'm pretty much open to any and all suggestions, but I obviously don't have the skills to do everything.

After a day filled with light-headedness (Dec 26th) I went to urgent care \u2013 they took a blood test said there was nothing concerning and told me to follow-up with my regular doctor. Some of the results copied and pasted below, the test flagged me as having high Neut Auto 70.1 (normal 33-66) and RDW SD 45 (normal 35.1 \u2013 43.9). They are both a little high not a ton, what do they mean? The next week (Jan 3rd) my doctor looked me over and diagnosed a Large intestine infection and gave me ciprofloxacin to take for 10 days told me to take with a probiotic and gave me Meclizine for nausea, which he told me to take a couple of days and scheduled a follow up 2 weeks later. Two days into taking Cipro I had black chunks in my stools. I called my doctor and he had my stools tested for blood(by the time I got the test I had no more black stuff in my stools). At my 2 week after checkup I was still having nausea but my stools seemed to be more normal (softer than normal, but not jagged or very watery). My doctor then suggested I do half somersaults and if those didn\u2019t help said we would need an MRI with contrast on my brain and if that didn\u2019t show anything abnormal, my next step was a neurologist. So I tried the half somersaults and when I did it everything in my head spun and I started puking, but all my nausea didn\u2019t go away, but it got a lot better. So I discussed with my doctor again and set up an appointment with an ENT. I set up the appointment with the ENT last Friday and had it Tuesday (yesterday), but a little after I set up the appointment it felt like my right ear drained and I didn\u2019t have nausea all weekend and through the appointment. The ENT checked me out said my ears were normal, and my symptoms sounded like a classic case of BPV.  Told me instead of the half somersault to try the reverse Eply maneuver if it happened again. Today unfortunately I have been light headed off and on all day, and the reverse Eply seems to have done nothing and I still feel fatigued.\n \nSo I am worried that my light headedness has nothing to do with BPPV and just comes and goes, and it happened to around the time I did the half somersaults.\n \nSo now I am wondering a couple of things, does my blood test indicate that I need more tests, what tests? Are indicative of something like leukemia(I don\u2019t know high white blood cells, fatigue, prone to infection)?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, this has been dragging on for a couple of months and I was hoping some people could help give pointers.\n \n \nHct\n(Normal: 41.0-53.0)\n46.2\tGraph\nHemoglobin\n(Normal: 13.5-17.5)\n15.9\tGraph\nLymph %\n(Normal: 24.0-44.0)\n25.5\tGraph\nLymphs, Abs\n(Normal: 1.2-3.4)\n1.7\tGraph\nMCH\n(Normal: 26.0-34.0)\n30.5\tGraph\nMCHC\n(Normal: 32.0-36.0)\n34.4\tGraph\nMCV\n(Normal: 80.0-100.0)\n88.7\tGraph\nMixed cells, (Mono, Eos, Baso)\n(Normal: 1.1-20.4)\n4.4\tGraph\nMixed cells, Absolute (Mono, Eos, Baso)\n(Normal: 0.2-1.7)\n0.3\tGraph\nMPV\n(Normal: 6.6-12.4)\n10.1\tGraph\nNeut, Abs\n(Normal: 1.8-6.8)\n4.6\tGraph\nNeut, Auto\n(Normal: 36.0-66.0)\n70.1\tGraph\nPLTS\n(Normal: 150-400)\n299\tGraph\nRBC\n(Normal: 4.50-5.90)\n5.21\tGraph\nRDW\n(Normal: 11.3-15.6)\n14.2\tGraph\nRDW SD\n(Normal: 35.1-43.9)\n45\tGraph\nSpecimen Type\tBlood\tGraph\nWBC\n(Normal: 3.6-10.6)\n6.6\tGraph\n\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskDocs","subreddit_id":"t5_2xtuc","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Feel tired and lighted generaly \"sluggish\"","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/7uey7n/feel_tired_and_lighted_generaly_sluggish/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

I want to skip this stage and just be in a comfortable relationship. Except I know exactly what this is. It's not love it's a dopamine high. And when I don't get a message my brain just wants that high so I reach for my phone. \n\nI don't want to mess this up, I don't want to make her annoyed and end up canceling on me. And I really really want to feel like I can call my nerves and not be so distracted and love sick. I'm 25, so I want to really enjoy what happens. I don't want to be a little boy worried about what happens next. \n\nI'm trying to remind myself that:\n1) We are not committed at all. So don't make plans - and I've failed this because I'm fantasizing what kind of life we would have.\n2) I need to let there be space and breathing room even if I feel like I'm sophocating. - Right now I am at home from surgery, with nothing to distract me. Thankfully I haven't screwed up and I keep my distance as far as texting.\n3) the relationship will end up being long distance and I need to remember that this feeling may end up lasting a while.

I am head over heels in love. I need advice bad. How do I slow down and let this just happen. How do I stop overthinking every single thing that's happening and just breath and let it unfold? \n\nTL;DR Fallen in love, but adhd is making me want to be all over this girl rather than let it naturally unfold. How do I relax my nerves and enjoy this?\n\nUpdate: I've really kept my cool by talking to you guys and friends and today I had something truly promising happen. Typically the guy always confirms the date, yet she went out of her way to ask me if we were still good for the date. I'll post one more update after the phone date. The best advice I can give out of these last few days is you can be burning on the inside but talk to family and friends or whoever will listen. It will keep you sane. \n\nFurther Update: Things went very well last night. I told her I had ADHD and she was more than accepting of it! It seems that we are really hitting it off which is great. I also scored a second date with her on Saturday. I was also SUPER awkward at the end of the phone call. I think it's important to remember that people are very understanding.

Ever since you first caught a glimpse of the bulge underneath my towel, you thought there's no way it could have been real. Even if it was....there's no way it was attached to someone in *your own* family. You had to see it. There wasn't any other option. You walked up to the bathroom door as the shower was on just behind it. Cracking it open slightly just enough to peek your head in. The steamy room obscuring your view, but it's outline is clear as you turn your head towards the shower I'm in. *Holy FUCK, that thing is MASSIVE* you think to yourself. Watching in awe as water runs down my body, the long thick shaft flopping around as it hangs off my body. You had to see more. You *NEED* to see more. \n\n\nThe question is who are you?\n\n\nMy little sister. Our bedrooms sharing a bathroom between them. Ever since that day you've started teasing me, doing things like leaving the door open when you get out of the shower with just a towel on, wearing progressively less and less over a few weeks...eventually just wearing a top and your underwear as you get ready to go out/go on dates/get ready for bed at night. You've also been spying on me late at night, watching me stroke myself while watching porn, and while you don't know it, I've realized you've been doing it and giving you a better show.\n\n\nOr are you my mother? Married and faithful wife to my father for the past 23 years. The shining example of a perfect wife and mom. Always at home and making sure something healthy for dinner is on the table, a fixture at PTA meetings, always on the sidelines for my football games, and a regular for tennis at the country club. Yet, once you see it you just can't help yourself. You fawn over me constantly. The thought of your own son...it drives you crazy knowing that *that thing* is attached to your little baby boy. You can't stop thinking about it, your vibrator is getting more work that it's seen in years after that peek into the bathroom. You find yourself fantasizing about me as your husband, my dad fucks you at night. (We can take this further if you're into cuckolding. Your husband's little dick pales in comparison. He's fat and overweight, barely able to climb the stairs without getting winded. And stamina? It's a dream to you after 20 years of 2 minutes of pumping and him rolling over and falling asleep. 20 years of frustration, and the answer was in the room down the hallway. His own son, a bigger man, a better man, more of a REAL man than him.) You sneak around the house, trying to catch a glimpse of me. Getting bolder and bolder as you stay up late, sneaking out of bed after dad has long since passed out and down the hallway. Cracking the door to my room and watching me. Trying to keep quiet as you touch yourself just outside the door. Me knowing...giving you a better and better view each night you come to the door.\n\n\nIdeally I'm 5'11 and very athletic, as I've been playing both baseball and football since I was little. I'm built not like a GQ model, but like an athlete. A large chest/broad shoulders, thick muscular thighs from all of the running/conditioning drills, and a toned stomach. (More private areas we can discuss via PM beforehand or in the scene, up to you)\n\n\nI have fairly few limits, no bathroom stuff or blood, not into extreme violence/rape either. Ageplay is generally ok too, though I don't normally do extreme ageplay. If you can't tell, I dig the cuckold aspect if you're wanting to play the mom. I'd like to play that up if you are into it, but I understand if that's not something you are into and would rather leave out. I'm pretty open to changes or even something completely different so feel free to shoot me a message.  I'd like this to be a longer term thing. Not looking to jump right in, but would rather establish our characters and have a bit of buildup before we finally get hot and heavy.\n\nThanks for reading and hope to hear from some of you soon!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"18M4F - That thing?

Last year after many episodes and situations I was diagnosed bipolar and they are still working on getting the right meds and doses for me. \nA few months ago I started spending time with a guy, every thing was great and we decided to try to be gf and bf. He started posting a lot about me us on social media. Im not the kind of girl who posts a lot about my relationships. Im very active on Instagram cause i like to share about my bipolar disorder journey but being 2018 I didn't see anything wrong with him posting so much about us. \nWeeks later he started fighting with me almost every day. He would make me feel bad cause I wasn't in love with him as he was in love with me. I tried to explain that i was enjoying the relationship and that i still needed more time for it to happen but i was getting there. Then xmas and new year's came and it was a huge fight cause i dont celebrate any of that and i wasn't even in town during that time cause i made plans to travel before meeting him. I've told him that i have generalized anxiety and i need time before meeting his family and this lead to another fight about how bad of a GF I am. I've spent many days explaining to him what is it like for me to have bipolar disorder and try to have a \"normal\" social life. I also explained that for the same reason I'm very close to the few friends i have cause they've been through hell with me and this disorder since he was upset at me for not trusting him like I trust my friends.\nAll this happened in 2 months which for me was a short time to get to love him and trust him as much as he was asking me to.\nIt feels like every time I talk to him i end up explaining why I am the way i am as if everything I do is wrong. \nOne day after telling him that it wasn't working for me and my health, we ended the relationship. Then I found out that he posted on fb that I cheated on him and that one day I was gonna regret it. I never cheated on him and he never found anything that could make him believe so. I got messages from his friends saying I was a bitch and stuff.\nYesterday he called me to apologize for hurting and to say that he was finally understanding what I've been through cause he was diagnosed bipolar after seeing a therapist 1 day. Today he asked to see each other and try again. I told him I wasn't ready for it yet. His response was this...\n\"Well I\u2019m sorry. I guess this relationship is another thing I lost to my bipolar.

I'm growing a bit disillusioned with school because I don't really enjoy the way they teach the stuff. I'm at a college known in my home country, but it's basically a no-name university because of the location. I've been doing fine in freshman and sophomore, but struggling a bit to keep up this year because of my job. I work remotely for a very early-stage US startup, but full-time.\n\nThe job is exciting and I find it fun; studying for my exams\u2015not so much. As a result of that, my grades haven't been that good lately, and I felt my motivation drop. I was lucky enough (and I do mean lucky) to get a Big 4 internship offer abroad for this summer, but that also made me ask what was the point in doing your best in college, as I don't feel what I've learned there has helped me that much. I have about 3 years of professional experience now (I've started working in the field as a Junior Software Engineer in various jobs when I was in high school, in order to pay the bills) and about 12 of overall experience (doing any kind of programming), but I was a kid for a good part of that time, so I probably just needed a lot more time to grasp some concepts than someone e.g. in college doing the same thing. I feel like I learn so much more things with actual work experience than class; when I do study for my exams, I mostly do it off Wikipedia and on my own because I've grown accustomed to that way, and I find the materials provided by the course hard to follow, and they aren't always of the best quality. I've always looked at college as something you *had* to do in order to have a chance anywhere, not something that really has much value on its own, so maybe this view is starting to catch up to me. The bad thing is that I can't convince myself otherwise.\n\nIs anyone else in the same boat as me? Is there something that helped you find motivation do your best in school, or finish it in time, when there's more exciting stuff to do?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\nP.S. I've seen that people on this subreddit are often accused of humblebragging, so I hope I don't come across the wrong way. (I've created a throwaway for of this reason.) I don't believe I'm any better than anyone else, I just had the luck to find out about programming so early on in my life and take interest in it, and I think the time I invested is starting to pay off. And I also believe that I got most of my offers and opportunities, etc. more because I can talk smoothly during interviews than my actual abilities, and more because I had done a lot of competitive programming in high school which gives me the upper hand with LC-style questions, but does not really mean I'm better at the job. so I wouldn't think of bragging about them in a place like this.

It seems to be all over the scalp as my sides feel thinner too. I'm 21 years old btw.\n\nI know the standard answer here is: it's genetic, you're going bald because of your genes. I know that it is highly (80-90%) possible that it is true. I'm trying (and succeeding) to accept that fact more and more.\n\nThere are a few things that I still doubt about. *The thing about diffuse thinning that really sucks is that you won't know for sure what causes it.* I have a few thoughts that I can't get out of my head:\n\n* 'It could be Telogen Effluvium' -&gt; I have been in a pretty nasty car accident a year ago. But I only noticed my hair getting thinner about 7-8 months later so that would've taken way longer than normal (normally it starts like 3 months after the trigger)\n\n\n* 'It could still be Telogen Effluvium, prolonged because of stress' -&gt; The months after the car accident were very stressful, to say the least, I had barely any free time and felt pressure from my environment. I got kinda burned out and started smoking weed daily when things got more quiet.\n\nThing is, if it was TE, shouldn't it start regrowing by now? I have noticed the most significant loss between August till now, but it could've started earlier if I didn't notice it (I had longer hair back then).\n\n* 'The family history doesn't make sense' -&gt; My dad didn't have the aggressive early thinning, my mom's side has no balding at all. Only thing is that my dad's brother had aggressive thinning. But if I got it through my dad's genes, why wouldn't it show for him?\n\n* 'It could be diffuse alopecia areata' -&gt; I can't find a lot of info about this. Only thing I've read is that it is hard to diagnose as it can mimic genetic thinning and that it can happen.\n\n**So what are my possibilities?** My doctor has no knowledge on this subject at all, he says it'd probably thicken up again. Blood tests showed I'm healthy (hurray). I won't start fucking with my hormones if I'm not entirely sure it is genetic thinning (again, hurray for diffuse thinning, if it was in the regular pattern I'd at least be sure of my case). My doctor said he could send me to a dermatologist if I really want, but he says they are very likely not knowledgeable on this subject.\n\nI know there is a big chance that it is genetic anyway, because I'm a guy and that happens in 90% of the cases. But I don't want to risk fucking up hormone levels for the 10% chance it would restore naturally.

She's 18, I'm 19 now.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA and B met through mutual friend in June 2014. They are living about 150 km = 93 miles apart. They quickly became pretty good friends. From July to September they were talking a lot on the phone. After September we basically spent 2+ hours every day talking on Skype and playing games together. At this point we were already really good friends and cared for each other. We couldn't stop talking. We never run out of things to talk about. This continued for quite some time\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNovember that year was first time we met. She came with her school to my city and she had some free time. It was quite awkward at first. Because we've never seen each other until now but it was obvious we were really both really glad to see each other finally. At December I came to her city on my own to spend a day with her and out mutual friend. It was just great and it was the first time we kissed. But like all of us kissed with everyone so like A kissed B and best friend , I kissed A and best friend and best friend kissed with A and B. So it was more friendshly even thou we both wanted it and were excited about it. At the end of the day she gave me her woolly hat and I'm sleep with it from that day till now. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSoon after i started having some really strong fillings for her. I think we can say I feel in love. I couldn't have stopped thinking about her. I haven't told her that because she hasn't shown any interest in me for something more than a friend and even if she would be willing to give it a chance, she wouldn't because we weren't able to see each other more than 1 every 2-3 months due to living far apart. This continued for like really long maybe 1,5 years. I didn't have any girlfriends or anything... I just didn't find them as interesting as her. She had like decent number of guys she kiss in club and 2 boyfriends but those relationship didn't last for very long. Let's just say whenever she kissed someone it hurt me but i never told her anything since like I'm her friend I don't have the right to tell her anything like that... \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWell after that 1,5 years some problems came in our friendship. We didn't really solved them and combined with 3/4 times we met in live sucked, she decided to end our friendship (it wasn't this simple but this text is already long so... yea). Well at the end i decided to tell her i had/have fillings for her for really long time, not to keep her but more to like idk tell her because it was in me for so freaking long. After that we didn't really talk too much but we talked about important things only and like yea... Even thou we kinda ended our friendship we cared for each other. And to my surprise even thou my infatuation weaken through all those years I really felt like shit, 0 worth and defeated every time she kissed someone or smth like that. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLike this summer one other girl was like I can suck your dick if u want and I was like naah i don't really want that. I mean she wasn't too attractive but esspecialy if u'r a guy u'll understand how much I'm fucked up to like decline a bj lol...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyways at the end of September 2017. I came to study at her city. ( I didn't have good enough grades to go in university for that subject in my city ) . We met for coffee and after 15 minutes of weirdness we were like we didn't have a 8 month break. She even canceled some plans with her friends that weekend and came to drink with me at my place. It was like awesome she slept at my place and we slept together ( not sex only sleep ). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd it was like really all great until this weekend. We went out to a club with our best friend and few more people and ofc she found someone or actually he found her and I just couldn't really watch that. I mean I was just drinking and drinking i cleaned everyone's drinks what were on table few times. I just stared at her and tried to take her away from him or any other guy that came I just couldn't look at her but i know i had no right to do that. I mean she \"send\" our best friend to keep me ocupied since I was just jerk... I totaly lost it and i don't remember better part of that night. At the end we got to my place and i was totaly out of it. For fuck sake I was throwing up with my head in wc and started fucking talking like I was streaming. I was fucking crawling on floor in front of her... Yea... \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the morning we talked about it and I was really sorry for what I've done because i can't really control my self when I'm drunk but that's like not only thing. Every time she's with other guy i just felt so fucking bad... Like my soul is hurting me, I'm half crying, I'm total mess, I think can't find my self half worth it. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe day after I asked her if there was any chance that she'd gave us a chance. Even thou I knew chances were very close to 0 \nI wanted to try because yea... And she took it pretty hard, ofc answer was no and she was a bit hurt that i asked her that i could feel. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI just don't know what to do... I don't even think about us being together, I know it won't happen, but I can't do anything to stop the pain. I tried so fucking many things... But the pain is so fucking big, and i just can't stop thinking about her and everything... I honestly want to be free of that love of whatever the fuck this is. I want to be happy for her when she has someone and to be able to actually have someone for myself. I'm just really sad about everything because I'm causing her pain and I'm in pain but there is really nothing I can remember to do. I'm honestly at the point to think about going to psychologist\nwith this, it is that bad i feel... and it's like 3 years of this pain and shit it just so fucked up... \n\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjdm","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Years of one-way love","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7uf5e9/years_of_oneway_love/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

I\u2019m seriously torn between two job opportunities!\n\nA little back story: I am 20 years old, I plan on going back to University in September 2019, and I am currently working two part time jobs. I work as a sales associate for a clothing store where I only get about 4.5 hours a week due to over staffing and the recent wage increase (also I live in Toronto, Canada) so that is not sufficient for saving for school next year. I also work as a server in a restaurant where I get about 15 hours a week (also over staffed and affected by the wage increase but the tips are nice). I don\u2019t pay rent, but I own a car that I pay insurance and gas for. \n\nI have been applying for full time work on top of my serving position for quite some time and have just been offered a position at a 4 star hotel as a server. The wage is 13.50 an hour with pooled tips, and about 25-30 hours a week guaranteed. I know two people who work there already which is how I got the job and they tell me the potential for tips is 40-100 dollars in the mornings and 100- (a maximum)300 at nights. The hours are not fixed so I would have to coordinate every week my hours with the restaurant AND the hotel. It comes with benefits after 3 months and is unionized. I am expected to sign employment papers tomorrow at 10 AM and start training on Monday. \n\nOn the other hand, I received a call from a family member not 2 hours ago and they offered me a job with an electrical company they work at. The wage would be (around) $16/hour with 40 hours a week and fixed hours. Also has benefits. Managing the hours with my serving job would be a lot easier but it\u2019s also a farther travel which means more money on gas. I\u2019d be working with a few cousins and friends, but there are no tips. Also I\u2019d get weekends off, which is just a little bonus. \n\nSo, r/personalfinance, do I take the job with tips and the potential to make a lot of money (but also the potential to not make a lot) with wonky hours or do I choose a fixed schedule with a set amount of money I\u2019ll be making?\n\nThe math again, but more organized;\n\nHotel - $13/hour + (Min.) $40 in the morning shift, (Min.) $100 in the night shifts. Only 25 hours a week. \n\nElectrical - ~$16/hour, 40 hours a week and overtime potential. \n\nI know this is a long post but I\u2019ve wracked my brain and they both seem like viable options.

Over the summer I will have opportunities for extra income by teaching summer classes and attending professional development, but that income may be minimal and spread out over two months.\n\nMy job right now in theory pays enough to live on... however I've been seeing less than expected on my paychecks, possibly due to some pay getting pulled for over the summer. I'm waiting to hear back from payroll about whether that's the case, but for now the situation is that my pay does not cover the bare minimum of my living expenses.\n\nI'm at about $1600/month coming in (and was expecting closer to $2000 take-home pay). I have just under $1100 in my checking account, and about $5100 in savings. \nMy monthly expenditures are: rent, electricity, car payment, groceries, insurance, tithe (this is **non-negotiable** and will NOT get cut), internet, and phone. In total, that comes to $1625. I am also in school for my master's right now, which my parents are helping me pay for. Since my courses are 5 weeks long, about every month and a half I will have $280 to pay for tuition. That hits this month (thankfully) right after my next payday. \n\nSo on tuition months, I'm at $1905. This is with cutting out absolutely all other spending, which is tough because I normally get coffee on Saturdays and do homework. If I add that in, I'm at around $1925ish.\n\nI'd rather not cut into my savings too much, though I know that's what it's there for - so I guess my question is... at what point is it \"OK\" to use my savings? They're already low because I just bought a car in August. I'd rather not put my Master's on hold since I just started and my job right now is incredibly perfect for it schedule-wise, but that's looking like the biggest thing putting me over budget right now. \n\nIs it terrible to pull that $400-500 from savings every month until August?

He started posting a lot about me us on social media. Im not the kind of girl who posts a lot about my relationships. Im very active on Instagram cause i like to share about my bipolar disorder journey but being 2018 I didn't see anything wrong with him posting so much about us. \nWeeks later he started fighting with me almost every day. He would make me feel bad cause I wasn't in love with him as he was in love with me. I tried to explain that i was enjoying the relationship and that i still needed more time for it to happen but i was getting there. Then xmas and new year's came and it was a huge fight cause i dont celebrate any of that and i wasn't even in town during that time cause i made plans to travel before meeting him. I've told him that i have generalized anxiety and i need time before meeting his family and this lead to another fight about how bad of a GF I am. I've spent many days explaining to him what is it like for me to have bipolar disorder and try to have a \"normal\" social life. I also explained that for the same reason I'm very close to the few friends i have cause they've been through hell with me and this disorder since he was upset at me for not trusting him like I trust my friends.\nAll this happened in 2 months which for me was a short time to get to love him and trust him as much as he was asking me to.\nIt feels like every time I talk to him i end up explaining why I am the way i am as if everything I do is wrong. \nOne day after telling him that it wasn't working for me and my health, we ended the relationship. Then I found out that he posted on fb that I cheated on him and that one day I was gonna regret it. I never cheated on him and he never found anything that could make him believe so. I got messages from his friends saying I was a bitch and stuff.\nYesterday he called me to apologize for hurting and to say that he was finally understanding what I've been through cause he was diagnosed bipolar after seeing a therapist 1 day. Today he asked to see each other and try again. I told him I wasn't ready for it yet. His response was this...\n\"Well I\u2019m sorry. I guess this relationship is another thing I lost to my bipolar.

(https://www.reddit.com/r/ABDL/comments/3zbiuz/sexual_question_for_guys/)\n\nI just bought Qtty Rawrs, they're super cute and its the first time I've had diapers since I was 10 (back when I wet the bed and had goodnites). I'm 20 now, so its needless to say I got really hard when putting it on (brain jumped straight to masturbation). They came in right before my midterms so I just tried it on to see if I'd enjoy the feeling, but then I had to run. I have another tonight so after I will wear it to bed :D.\n\nI have a long-distance boyfriend who thinks this is all really cute, and wants to control when I j/o, since thanks to some side-effects of a medication I take I'm like a pre-teen again.\n\nSince diapers are expensive, so I can really only wear one or two a week...\n\nMy boyfriend thinks that if I can only cum in something I can wear twice a week at max, then I can hopefully start to decrease my overall j/oing an get back down to where we were at before - once a week or every two weeks. Since I'm to do it in only a diaper, he jokingly uses baby talk (which drives me crazy) - and tells me stickies.\n\nBut since they're expensive, I don't want to destroy it while trying to j/o. Also, I'm cut, so humping things doesn't really work well for me. I do drip a lot of precum, but it takes hours (and usually rubs something raw - I've only tried this twice).\n\nWhat do y'all do to cum in your padding?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ABDL","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8xk","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Making stickies in a diaper","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ABDL/comments/7ufeip/making_stickies_in_a_diaper/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw"}

I would learn so much and be blown away by your skill...\n\nI will admit it, i simply love older women who are hungry for young cock, from the women I have spoke to in the past, its definitely the ones who simply love having a young body to play with that are the most fun so if you simply adore young guys, love the fact that you're a kinky cougar and arent ashamed to admit it then bonus points for you! One of the things i love about older women is their experience, they've mostly seen it all and done it all before and know just how to drive a young guy insane, if I was to be lucky enough to be with one then they'd give me standards that no one could live up to around my age.\n\nSome of my kinks include: Blowjobs, older women, being seduced, ass, anal, face sitting, spanking, lots of cum, dirty talk and women with experience. However, I would love to explore more and learn more about the things that get my teen dick so hard....\n\nI am open to most things and am happy to either chat or roleplay!

Could you please tell me how to find out if I am improving retention.\n\nA few Questions\n\n1. If we look at the first row, Oct 30, on less than week one we are 100%. On week one I am 66.67%. On week two I am 44.44%. I would like to know, is that 44% of the pool from the 100% or is that only from the pool of the 66.67%? For weeks this is not as relevant but for days this question is relevant as if users use the product 3 days in a week then the day retention chart might be misleading as you may retain 100% of users but this chart might show only 1/3.\n\n2. On November 6th, I have 29 people at the less than one week mark. Does that include the 9 people from Oct 30th? Or I suppose it would be the 66% of the 9 people?\n\n3. Why use cohorts when looking at a retention chart?\n\n4. I am using mixpanel, What is an easy way to see if my retention is improving?\n\n5. Can you give me any general tips or something that you recommend reading?\n\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"analytics","subreddit_id":"t5_2rhz9","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Could you give me a hand learning how to read this retention chart?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/7ufha2/could_you_give_me_a_hand_learning_how_to_read/","whitelist_status":null}

The backstory isn't too important, but the short version is that I was in the military and my wife maxed out most of our credit cards while I was deployed.  I got medically discharged and am now divorced, but I have about half the debt (cards were in both of our names.)  \n\nI'm currently looking at nearly $14,500 in credit card debt and $7,000 on my car.  I'd rather not sell the car if entirely possible, as I've had unreliable vehicles before and it's a lot of stress wondering if it's gonna need repairs at any point; however I do understand if it's unavoidable.\n\nFirst off, my income.  I'm 24 years old and working part time while attending college.  All in all, I make around $27,000 a year if I take student loans (and I don't want to do that), or $22,000 if I don't.  That's ~$1,833 a month with the option of taking an additional $5,000 in loans.  I don't have any time for an extra job or more hours, as this is hard enough to handle as is.\n\n**My Finances**\n\n\n\nItem | Debt | Monthly Payment\n---|---|---\nCredit Card 1 | $7,500 | $155\nCredit Card 2 | $7,000 | $140\nCar Payment | $7,000 | $231\nCar Insurance | -------- | $134\nInternet | -------- | $70\nUtilities | -------- | $70\nCell Phone | -------- | $70\nRent | -------- | $650\nMisc | -------- | $50\n**Total** | **$21,500** | **$1,570**\n\nNow, this isn't an awful position for me to be in.  While throwing in random information such as gas, groceries, etc., I wind up being in the positive (albeit barely), there is a problem that's arisen for me.  A large portion of my income comes from my student aid, and due to an issue with my schedule I just found out I will be attending school for an extra semester, making me graduate in December 2019.  However, my student aid runs out in August of 2019.  \n\nMy original plan was to graduate in the Spring and start working that August (I'm to be a high school teacher, so I need to be hired in early Fall/late Summer) meaning I would have no interruption of income.  It would have been tense, but doable.  Now I've realized I will be out of Student Aid and waiting from December 2019 until August 2020 before I can start really working, aside from substituting for other teachers occasionally, while paying back the couple of student loans I do have.\n\nI'm wanting to try and get something figured out now, while I still have about a year and a half to prepare.  I'm lucky that this wasn't suddenly sprung on me, but it's still worrying as I have no idea how I can get my debt payments low enough to clear them out and be \"safe\" once I graduate.  I know I could sell my car and I have considered it; the downside is that I'll still have to drop a few thousand dollars to pay for a cheaper one anyway, as I cannot go without a vehicle in my area (rural).  \n\nI'm sure there's more info necessary, so please just ask and I'll provide anything.  I'm just trying to get things settled in before they become a real problem; I'm wanting to focus on Credit Card 1 first because it has a higher interest rate.  Credit Card 2 is obviously my next focus, with the car being last.  I've settled for the lowest internet packages available to me right now, my utilities are fairly low for my area, and my housing is very cheap for here as well.  \n\nThank you for any help you can provide!!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Got divorced and stuck with lots of credit card debt, in school and unsure how to continue","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7uflut/got_divorced_and_stuck_with_lots_of_credit_card/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

I'm down to talk about deep stuff, funny stuff or just what ever our conversations lead us. But either way I'm up to talk about anything and every. \n\nP.s. I'm on mobile so I'm praying to God that the mods don't take down beacuse I didn't hit that 500 characters. Other then that I guess I'll talk about myself some more and tell you I'm 5 foot 9 inches with size 11.5 shoe size.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"penpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2r076","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"USA\\M\\19","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/7ufncc/usam19/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

I finished my first two years of college before I was 17. Why? I was lucky enough that I was not involved with girls, however.....before being enlightened by the red pill I became depressed when I saw all my friends around me having women and I didn't; especially because I could not understand why. I am 6'0, i've been told by many that I look good, I am an athlete and I often work out because it's my hobby, not to mention my results and possibly my best asset: (which was ironically not working at the time) my intelligence. Long story short I fell prey to this whore sjw femenazi. We didn't have sex but we did things, and though I left her quickly she hates me for leaving her (despite bragging that that's \"how she rolls\") and believes I perpetuated a fake std story (which her best girl-friend did in order to scare me so I would leave her) and whatnot. Only thing I said was that for a whore, she really has no clue what she's doing. You guys can imagine I have a very bright future ahead, and I have plans to run for city council and later mayor, senator, etc. once I reach the required age to do so. THE PROBLEM: I can't sleep at night out of fear that thi whore will remeber my name and make some fake story that will ruin my life and career in the future. Even though in end, I am sure I will be absolved, we all know a woman's word is gold in this shit society and even after I am cleared I will be screwed wether I am innocent or not. Please guys I am asking for your help, leave your opnions, etc. Thank you in advance.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MGTOW","subreddit_id":"t5_2sjgc","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Very large problem, #metoo may destroy my life","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/7ufp70/very_large_problem_metoo_may_destroy_my_life/","whitelist_status":"promo_specified"}
