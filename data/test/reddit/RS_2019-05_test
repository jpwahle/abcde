Sorry ahead of time for the wall of text, but I appreciate anyone taking the time to read it through and see if they can relate!  \nI have been experiencing migraines for 3 years. I'm 26 now. I get 2 types of headaches. One is a textbook migraine on one or both sides of my head, with throbbing, light sensitivity, etc. The other headache is different. It feels like muscle tension in my temples, face and jaw, it only ever occurs on one (and the same) side of my head (right), and has no identifiable triggers. This second type of headache is the one that makes life unbearable at times. It's chronic and unpredictable. I can go weeks without having a headache like this, and then be stuck in an endless cycle for weeks.   \nInitially, I thought it was jaw pain. I saw my dentist and an oral facial pain specialist. The specialist thought it was because of teeth clenching. I wore a day time and night time guard for 6 months. Wearing these guards re-trained my mouth\/bite, I do not clench anymore (who knows if I ever did) because at rest my mouth is slightly open and tongue is on the roof of my mouth. This is the desired affect of the guards, and it did seem to help for some time.  \nOnce seeing a neuro, he told me that he believed my migraine was a true migraine because all my pain followed branches of the trigeminal nerve. The approximate location of the trigeminal nerve is where I have the most pain, and it radiates up into my temples, top of my head, behind my eye, and neck. I have even felt tingles of pain under my nose. I have been receiving medical Botox for almost 1 year now, and I believe it's helping with my other, more traditional migraine. I thought it WAS helping the primary chronic headache, but like I said, it's unpredictable to start with, so it's been difficult for me to determine whether it's actually helping or not.  \n\n\nAll 4 of my wisdom teeth are fully erupted. They took years to grow in, and I would say they were pretty much fully grown in when I was around 21-22. My dentist told me for years that if they weren't causing problems, there was no reason to remove them. I had enough room in my mouth, and 3 of my 4 WT grew in perfectly straight. However, my WT on the top right side of my mouth grew in somewhat straight, but at an angle. So it's mostly aligned with the other teeth in the row, but grew in slightly to the right. My dentist has always insisted it's straight enough that it shouldn't be a problem. However, I am starting to wonder...  \n\n\nI am beginning to believe that this chronic headache, maybe it is a migraine, is caused by this wisdom tooth. I don't have enough knowledge to know if it's messing up my bite because of the angle, or if it's internally pressing or pinching a facial nerve that branches back to the trigeminal nerve, triggering more facial pain in it's other branches. I have had my bite adjusted many times and the wisdom tooth has never seemed to present a problem there, so I am leaning towards the second possibility. The pain is definitely the most intense right above this tooth, and in my temples\/above my ear.  \n\n\nIt turns out, my dentist actually retired and my new dentist specializes in facial pain, TMJ, and TMD. They offer many different types of therapies for the pain itself. I have an appointment for next week and I will be addressing my theory with my new dentist, who I hear is wonderful. I feel hopeful, but sadly, I am expecting to be let down still, as has been the trend in the past.  \n\n\nI am curious to hear what this community thinks, and if any of you have experience with this type of nerve or tooth pain causing a headache that sounds anything remotely like this! And if you think I'm totally bonkers, you can tell me that too haha.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"migraine","subreddit_id":"t5_2qr75","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/migraine","subreddit_subscribers":27449,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My crazy theory about what's causing *some* of my migraines.","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/migraine\/comments\/bjamkr\/my_crazy_theory_about_whats_causing_some_of_my\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

And right now everything is just too much to write out in depth so I'm gonna make a list:\n\n- My husband is deploying soon and will miss at least the first 5 months of our daughter's life\n\n- I got a cold sore today so I most likely wont get to kiss him goodbye\n\n- My mother, who I have a very strained relationship with, is moving to our state (30 minutes, or less, away from us) and I felt like things had been better because we were 1000 miles apart.\n\n- My mother keeps talking about being there when my daughter is born, I thought she meant in general but it was confirmed she meant in the delivery room. I do NOT want this and we had never discussed it. \n\n- I'm not sure I want my mother around my daughter in general. I've gone into further detail about this on other posts\/subs but basically I cant rely on her (she didnt show up to my wedding and never explained why), she has a history of putting herself in toxic relationships and needing me to rescue her, and I have reason to believe she is either back on drugs or struggling with a mental illness. \n\n- My MIL keeps making jokes about my daughter being born on her birthday. This is more BEC but God I seriously dont like this woman. She has a history of boundary stomping and I'm just waiting for her to try it with me. \n\n- My MIL made a public post about \"visiting\" for an undetermined amount of time because she can't wait for my husband to get back around Christmas to meet \"her grandbaby\". She said this without discussing it with me first, while talking in the 3rd person and using babytalk....\n\n- My stepmom is visiting for a month to help me with LO. I'm excited because my stepmom has been more of a mom to me in 5 years than my own mother has been in my whole life, but I dont know how to explain to my mom that I want stepmom in the delivery room and not her. \n\n- My grandfather died recently, it was expected but what I didnt expect was for my grandmother to leave me a voicemail saying he died, my brother to find out about his death over a Facebook post, and my mom to completely ghost us. She left a voicemail on messenger saying he died and when the funeral was (even though she knows I'm 8 months pregnant and cant fly...), then didnt message us at all or ask my father about us when they saw eachother at his funeral. She is usually so smothering. But the other day she started love-bombing me again and I dont know how to respond because she, once again, wasn't there when I needed her. \n\n- I had planned to send my mother a letter of \"no contact\", explaining that I dont want to see her or let her meet LO ( I dont know if it's forever or not), but then my grandfather died and he was like a father to her so I've been putting it off. \n\n- Only two people have gotten things off our registry, which I wouldn't at all mind if they hadn't INSISTED that I not buy anything because they'd \"take care of it\". I could've been preparing long ago instead of blowing our savings trying to catch up. \n\nSorry for the long rant... it's just all piling up and as we are getting closer to my husband deploying I'm freaking out more and more. Especially since there is window of a couple weeks between his deployment and my stepmom getting here where I may be completely alone during labor. I just never expected this. I should have since I married someone in the military but I honestly thought he would be there for her birth at least. I was going to go to a support group for moms today but....honestly the cold sore showed up and I really didn't want my first time meeting these women to happen when I'm a gross contagious mess and my lip is swollen to 3x its normal size.

I was introduced to the concept of Plurality a few months ago when one of the people I followed on twitter said they were plural. At first I didn't understand or think much of it, but then I began to look at their account and some of the things they were saying and or doing. I eventually DMed them because I wanted to thank them for some of the pro-autism activism they were doing. I was curious about their Plurality and so I asked a few questions. \n\nA few days after that I started feeling like I might be plural, and I'll get to why later in this post, but now that I had a better grasp of what Plurality was, I thought it could apply to me.\n\nSo, I'm making this to ask some questions because I'm not sure whether to doubt myself about being plural or not. So I'll guess I'll start asking questions now:\n\n1. Can Alters be similar to each other? Almost to the point where sometimes they think and feel the same things simultaneously?\n\n2. Is it the case where Alters don't always think completely for themselves, but instead add small thoughts to another Alters thoughts?\n\n3. Can Alters experience things like Gender Dysphoria? Maybe in a way that makes them less likely to communicate or think when they feel the systems body doesn't match their preferred gender? And would it be possible to draw them out if you were to match the systems body to their preference? \n\n4. Can people with ASD (Autism) experience being plural differently from Allistic (Not Autistic) people?\n\nThese are all of the questions I have at the moment, but I'll get into why I think I may be plural. But I guess should say a bit about myself first to give some context. \n\nMy name is Mathew, I'm 21, I'm an Ace Pansexual, and I have ASD (Autism). I'm content with my gender as male, but have always wondered what it's like to be female and to experience things from a females perspective. This is where my possible Alter comes in.\n\nHer name is May, and as far as I know she's mostly like me, but she's female. She really likes feminine stuff like certain anime and female fashion and such. I think she's against heavy makeup. She's very quiet but she tends to speak up when she wants to say hi to people or when it comes to some of the music on my phone (I think she sings along through me, at least when she can remember the lyrics). \n\nMy questions address some of my concerns. I've always liked feminine stuff, cute animals plushies, pink stuff, and more recently, girly\/feminine stuff like fashion and clothes, certain anime, like a series known as Pretty Cure (A magical Girl anime), and the idea of being feminine in manner with things like behavior and dress. I'm concerned I'm just imprinting this idea of being Plural from my interactions with a Plural person, or if I actually do have an Alter. \n\nI feel like she's said a few things, especially when it comes to the Pretty Cure music on my phone (She usually says what seasons music she wants to listen to, I think), and I think she's been telling me to say hi to my friends for her after I introduce them to her. But she's really quiet most of the time. I know there's the possibility that I'm a Closed system and it's just that she's not always around, but I just don't know what to expect from having an Alter. Some of the time I feel like I'm just thinking for her, and sometimes I don't know if it's just that she's thinking the same thing as me at exactly the same time, because I don't know if that's a thing Alters do.\n\nI think that May may not like my body (I've had and still have some issues with my body as a male, and I've had these issues before the idea of being Plural), and that's why she may not interact as much. I was planning on trying to dress in a Feminine manner (I have a skirt, and a mask, and I want to get a wig and some socks\/tights) before the idea of me being plural as introduced to me, but I think if I dress in a way that May prefers, she might be more active, if not actually becoming my front for some time. I've always had the feeling I would act differently if I saw myself differently (IE as someone other than myself, a male) and this idea of being Plural makes that feeling make more sense, but I'm still not completely sure what to think or feel.\n\nI'm not completely cemented on being Plural or not, I'm kinda in this wishy-washy state, and I'm just confused and uncertain. I was planning on talking to my therapist about this and seeing what they thought, but that could take a few days to even set up an appointment.\n\nI thought this would be the best place to ask these questions because I could get a whole bunch of peoples thoughts.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"plural","subreddit_id":"t5_35l44","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/plural","subreddit_subscribers":1047,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Trying to find out if I'm actually Plural, some questions and concerns.","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/plural\/comments\/bjaqny\/trying_to_find_out_if_im_actually_plural_some\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I don&amp;#39;t know any stars besides Anthony Davis who want to come to the Lakers and even if there are the Clippers provide a better landing spot. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a pretty real chance that the Clippers have better success in the next 10 years, and that the Lakers don&amp;#39;t perform as well under their new management as they did before. and in 10 years I&amp;#39;ll be 26 and everyone my age will have seen the Clippers be substantially better than the Lakers. the national Media will have to start talking about them more than the Lakers at some point if they keep winning, &lt;strong&gt;and in my opinion this sustained success would lead LA to become Clippers town in this generation.&lt;\/strong&gt; Thank u for my ted talk&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"nba","subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/nba","subreddit_subscribers":2402405,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[Serious] Why will Los Angeles never be Clippers town?","total_awards_received":0,"ups":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/bja6ui\/serious_why_will_los_angeles_never_be_clippers\/","user_reports":[],"view_count":null,"visited":false,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}],"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.nba","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"id":"bjas00","is_crosspostable":false,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":false,"is_self":false,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"discussion","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"e2582cec-7545-11e5-8e45-0ed4497f342d","link_flair_text":"Discussion","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"no_follow":true,"num_comments":1,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/LAClippers\/comments\/bjas00\/serious_why_will_los_angeles_never_be_clippers\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1560620688,"score":0,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"LAClippers","subreddit_id":"t5_2s8vl","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/LAClippers","subreddit_subscribers":43593,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"default","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[Serious] Why will Los Angeles never be Clippers town?","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/bja6ui\/serious_why_will_los_angeles_never_be_clippers\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I can't remember. After that was done, she took me to the ophthalmologist. He did the pinhole test and next, he put the thing that has all of the lenses on it in front of my face. The Phoropter. It had a rubber tube on it to rest your forehead against. While I was looking through the lenses on my left eye, it was a breeze. I gently pressed the tube against my head the whole time, but on my right eye, my vision is worse. He wouldn't change the lenses and kept saying, \"Try really hard! Keep trying! Don't forget to blink\" and without thinking about it, I smashed the rubber tube flat with my forehead so that I could get my right eye closer to the lens. I'm now worried that if I buy glasses with the prescription that he gave to me, for it to be correct, I would have to uncomfortably twist my new glasses on my face so that my right lens is way closer to my eye than my left one. What do you think? I was also complaining of double vision this time which I've never had before so at the end of the test, he projected a black dot on the wall and asked if I saw one dot or two while I was looking through the Phoropter. I closed my eyes, opened them, and very quickly the two dots became one so I said one but maybe I should've said two. What do you think?

My father is a psychiatrist, so I'm lucky to have had opportunities to try many different treatments, but none of them have worked. \n\nSince the time I was diagnosed, I've tried more medications than I can remember (including old antidepressants and antipsychotics). I've done group therapy, CBT, weekly visits with a psychiatrists and psychologists, experimental magnet therapy on 3 different parts of my brain, an inpatient program where I stayed at a facility for a month, the list goes on. A few years ago I even did ECT and that didn't even fucking work , all it did was fuck up my memory.\n\nThe last thing I've been trying is psychoanalysis. I pay a massive chunk of my paycheck to see a psychoanalyst 3-4 times a week for an hour each time, and it's not fucking working. I've been going almost every day for the past 2+ years and I'm still fucked. I can barely get by at work, I'm either drunk or high every night, half the time I want to kill myself. I've alienated what few friends I had by isolating myself and being depressed, I've only had one girlfriend in my life (she left me because I was too depressed all the time and didn't go out), I don't really talk to my family (they all treat me differently because I don't talk much and am the only one with seemingly untreatable mental health issues). Some days go by where I don't talk to anyone.\n\nI can feel myself get more and more isolated, and I can feel people get uncomfortable when I try the odd time to open up, so I don't. I feel like I've been steadily getting more and more depressed and I've run out of treatments to try.\n\nI don't think I can kill myself, I've already tried 3 times and it didn't work.

PM me if interested and full details will get sorted out in private. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for the long version\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello Reddit! I am looking for a freaky lady who would be down to enjoy the week of May 19-May 25 as a non stop fuck fest at my place! \n\nExplore one another\u2019s bodies past the points of exhaustion, take a moment of respite, and do it all over again, and again, and again- you get the point. My living arrangements right now provide me with a week of the place to myself (No I am not married or in a relationship, roommate is out for the week in question and I have it all to myself and want to make the most of it).\n\nBrief about me- I am 26, white, 6ft tall, blue eyes, dark blonde hair, and attend the gym semi-regularly. I\u2019ve been told more than once from people outside of my own family that I am indeed that conventional sort of attractive. I might not be packing six packs in the abs department but I am fit, quite strong, and stamina to back up anything I say. I am also clean, in both the drugs\/disease and hygiene. \n\nWho I am looking for- You. A female, around the ages of 22 to 27, who would be interested in a week of (near)non stop sex. All ethnicities welcome, I would ask that you are at least semi in shape so that we can really test one another\u2019s full sexual limits. No fun if one of us can run a marathon and the other is dying at the 10 yard line. Also, clean in both drugs\/disease and hygiene. Personal maintenance is something I perform and would expect about the same of you. \n\nI could host the entire week due to my fortuitous situation that is coming up, up to you if you would like to spend the nights or just come over after work. I do have a job of my own that keeps me out pretty much all day, so during weekdays this would be a guessing you do as well. This would simply be something to just end the day with and lose some sleep over in the best of ways during the week, and then go marathon sex drive when it hits the weekend. \n\nA small laundry list of things I am into (not a full list by any means)\n\nDom-sub relationship, light-medium bondage, orgasm control, oral (on you and\/or me), some role playing, very light food play (a can of whipped cream and strawberry\u2019s is just a classic)\n\nBy no means am I asking this to be a jump in feet first thing and hope for the best. A week like this would take some planning and definitely some build up. Would love to get to know you before hand a little, a coffee or drink to make sure that we both like what we see and to make sure that we are also compatible with what we want and expect from a week like this. \n\nIf you got down this far and are still interested in letting me make a wonderful week filled with pleasure for you, awesome! Shoot me a PM, we can chat on here or a different platform that you are comfortable with.

I'm 19 and I have been dating this girl for about a year and a half or so. I figured this subreddit would give me really good advice going forwards so I'll paint my situation.\n\nShe's really nice, the sex is good, but it's clear we aren't meant for each other. I like to get my hands dirty and she is afraid to go hiking for more than an hour. We argue lots and generally have very different plans for life.\n\nThis is stupid, young naivety on my part, but I ignored every red flag (there were lots). Whenever she was swoon at the idea of getting married I would always match her enthusiasm. She liked to talk about one day having kids and how happy she would be with them and how much she wants to be a mom. She gets excited over things like a new kitchen set or new makeup. I even agreed to fucking convert to Christianity for her (I couldn't in the end). Yes, I should have left long ago but being young I really liked feeling wanted and it was kind of a form of validation. \n\nBut now, I feel like I'm in too deep. Her family is like my second family, we do everything together and we even have plans to move in together for the school year. This is all happening so fast and I wish I could have seen it coming sooner. She has gotten too comfortable with me and if I'm being honest she has let herself go. She doesn't make an effort to conduct herself in a respectable manner and she doesn't eat healthy like she used to. She always pressured me into eating junk with her and I agreed and I basically lost my good physique I had worked so hard for. I'm not as physically attracted to her anymore and I feel bad for saying this but I'm nearly entirely emotionally detached, I have fallen out of love.\n\nI see a lot of guys here talking about their relationship situations and what not. But I want to say this: don't ignore the red flags or you will end up in this situation. I'm happy I experienced this because I know my next relationship will be so much better, but at the same time it sucks.\n\nIf anyone out there has been in a similar situation comment below.

My biological parents didn't put their race, so when the adoption agency told them I'm mixed, they assumed I was mulatto. It wasn't until I was 17-18 that I learned I was a hapa (bio dad was eurasian and bio mom was blasian).\n\nI've tried to communicate with my adoptive family regarding my identity because they've always been disrespectful to it and disregarded any issues I've had being mixed, but they don't listen.   They tried to raise me as a black child, but I was rejected by black kids. It was only when I brought it up to them as a child after I didn't understand why black kids didn't accept me that they had a half-ass talk with me about it. Shortly after, I started strongly identifying as mixed, and focused on building my identity around music, instruments, science, and math.\n\nWhites and Asians were my in-groups, and for the most part, they were extremely accepting. As I got older, I tried to connect more with my black side, but I've been struggling because I find black people more than other people tend to get upset if you say you're anything else other than black.  It's considered a way of trying to pass into whiteness or an alternative form of self-hatred, but in general, multiracial people are having a hard time being considered their own race without other races trying to push their baggage onto us. When I say \"I'm mixed with black, but I'm not black, I'm mixed,\" the historical 1-drop rule is referenced, how people perceive you in society being more vital to how you personally self-identity is referenced, and all around there's this persuasion argument presented where living in the past and letting others define you is ultimately more important than how you identity yourself.\n\nMy adoptive family refused to cook any Asian meals growing up, actively mocked Asian and African people, and also treated my mixed identity as a joke. My father shaved my head when I was 5 years old before a wedding because he was tired of dealing with afro-textured hair and my entire family used to poke fun at the idea I have to be careful when I go to my Asian friends' houses because they might cook dogs. Any serious talks I wanted to have with my parents about race are met with mockery and I've never felt secure in my race as a mixed person.\n\nAt family dinners, my race is always brought up, and if I get offended by random jokes, I'm painted as sensitive. If I say \"this is my race,\" they will get defensive and try to decide my race for me. I've tried to tell my adoptive parents about my biological parents, and said I was excited I got to learn more about my ethnicity and they were like \"I don't know why you're so obsessed with this,\" even though I've never even mentioned my biological parents more than once or twice in my life to avoid offending my adoptive parents.  \n\n\nStory:\n\nRecently (what inspired this post), I've been making Asian meals related to my Asian ancestry, learning how to cook properly, and learning more about food science to connect with my Asian roots. Everyone was teasing each other, and at some point, we poked fun of how my mom's favorite rice is minute rice.\n\nShe took this super personally and went on about how we were saying we hate her cooking, all rice is the same, minute rice is American and everyone wants to eat American food, and at some point said \"You're not Korean, so I don't know why you even care about making rice or Korean cuisines.\"\n\nNow, considering I don't identify as Asian (I identify as mixed), her telling me I'm not Korean isn't what upset me. What upset me is that I've communicated with her many times that I'm mixed and part of my mix is Asian. She continuously just ignores it and sums me up to a mulatto, and is belittling this healing journey I'm on where currently, cooking is one of the main ways I can connect with my ancestry.\n\nI'm not Korean, but I'm part Korean. This is part of me. I want to participate in this culture because it's part of who I am.   When she said I wasn't Korean, I felt like I wanted to cry. I'm 19 and moving out soon, and after all these years of effort, I've accomplished nothing. My adoptive family has refused to acknowledge my identity or struggles. They won't take responsibility for a lot of the suffering I went through (e.g. teaching me as a child my afro-textured hair wasn't manageable, telling me to get over things when I had troubles with black kids, relaxing my hair without my permission, and making fun of Africans and Asians).\n\nI'm upset.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"mixedrace","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnue","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/mixedrace","subreddit_subscribers":6170,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Adoptive White Mom Just Told Me I'm Not Korean And I'm High-Key Triggered","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/mixedrace\/comments\/bjb8ny\/adoptive_white_mom_just_told_me_im_not_korean_and\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I guess I was skinny at the time so it wasn't really followed up on, just a passing remark.  Looking back though, it did explain the heavy and irregular periods and random hair\/acne issues.  Fast forward a few years and I start to have high blood pressure issues and start to steadily gain weight, going from 115 to 150 in a year and just staying there.  Fast forward a few more years and I am 34, pregnant with my daughter. I gain a ton of weight and wind up admitted for 6 weeks with severe preeclampsia until they finally decide that they cannot control the BP anymore and deliver her 8 weeks early.  The day she is born, I lose 2 lbs.  2.  The baby herself weighs 4 lbs.   Now I am stuck at 200+ lbs and it isn't moving a bit.  I try keto, Adkins, counting calories (always between 900-1100 daily), a nutritionist, running, walking, dance classes, etc.  Nothing works.  I keep researching and try to find answers and everything keeps leading back to PCOS.  I suspect insulin resistance, and that plus the BP, the random fatty liver found last year, it all adds up, so I ask my doctor to recommend an endocrinologist. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday:\n\nI see the endo, she agrees that it is PCOS and insulin resistance causing this.  She also informs me that medication rarely takes weight down more than 5-10%, so I will need to look at possible bariatric options since it is all carried in my stomach for the most part.  She also tells me that 900-1100 calories is too high for me and that she would like me to limit calories to 800 per day and increase my exercising from 3 times a week to an hour per day.  She ordered cortisol testing, a sleep study. and metformin and sent a referral to the weight loss clinic, and I will follow up with her in 3 months.  I meant to ask her about intermittent fasting but I forgot.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you all think about this from your experiences?

My class doesn't hate me, they don't annoy me: win\/win.\n\nToday however I arrived to class and the room wasn't open yet. So I started a conversation with a colleague about an academic topic I needed to know. And a few people joined. And she mentioned her cramps. Then contraceptive methods. Then -FML- people were talking about sex. It felt so weird and unpleasant I just wanted to disappear. It didn't last more than 10 min but my discomfort persisted hours after.  \n\nI feel pathetic. I am already 23 and I still don't know how to act normal in those \"adult conversations\".

I also know that the flair says CPTSD Vent\/Rant but I want to clarify that I'm not formally diagnosed, and frankly shouldn't be considering the timeline.\n\nSo it's definitely been a wild week. I was running through reddit when I encountered [this thread about traumatic childhood memories.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/bgddn1\/what_is_your_childhood_memory_that_you_thought\/) At first I thought it'd be neat to read since I have a friend with CPTSD, and later ended up delving wayyyy deeper into it than I ever thought it would. Reading through that thread brought things back that I hadn't forgotten per se, but just repressed, I guess. It wasn't really a eureka moment, it was just some things that prompted memories. \n\nAt least, that was until I wrote a 1400 word reply to the thread. I said, sure, let's just talk about my experience for the hell of it, and as I wrote things progressively made more and more sense. Cue me rediscovering years of physical abuse, months of sexual abuse, and an entire lifetime of emotional and verbal abuse from my parents that I considered normal. To be fair, last October brought some of these memories back to, but not this vividly and extensive. Not even close.\n\nI knew I had been through rough patches as a kid, I just never thought of it as *significant*. It was more like something in the back of my mind. Now it's in the complete forefront, and literally everything about my mental health, my parents, and my anti-social tendencies is starting to make sense.\n\nWhen the previously mentioned friend with CPTSD first talked to me about it, I felt a sort of sympathy for what they were going through, as if I had seen the same. I felt like a complete fraud and idiot for thinking that I could be remotely in the same situation as them, someone who had been severely physically abused from infancy, sexually abused in childhood, and emotionally abused their entire life. I expressed the same kind of vigilance they did. They talked about their need for constant monitoring of their surroundings, and in particular, the people in them. I related. They talked about their intolerance to some sensory stimulants, and I related. Everything they were saying totally clicked with me, but I just didn't say anything because I didn't want to seem insensitive.\n\nAnd now it's like, *no shit I related, I have literally been through almost the exact same scenario.* It just took me years to realize how deep I actually was.\n\nThrough months of counseling, before any of this even came back to light, I always said the same thing to my counselor when he asked how I was around people, particularly in a public setting: I was highly cautious because something in my mind was telling me everyone was potentially dangerous. He thought I meant in a social way, but I clarified that I meant it in that they could put me in physical harm. He continued to classify this as social anxiety, which, yeah, I can understand.\n\nBut now everything is just so... amplified. Anxiety turned to panic, depression turned to pure self-hatred, and those \"things I related to with my friend dealing with CPTSD\" are so much more pronounced (ex. quite literally shivering with fear).\n\nI previously mentioned that in October I rediscovered some trauma. Namely, I knew that I had undergone sexual abuse and been recorded. But that was all I really knew -- I didn't have specific memories, I didn't have specific emotions tied to it. I just knew it happened and was scared. Now, I know it happened, how it happened, and exactly how I felt.\n\nThe sexual abuse is probably the part hitting me the hardest right now. I feel vulnerable and naked. I find myself feeling things that I don't even know how to describe, like my brain is a negative stream of thoughts as discernible as static on a television.\n\nI guess at the end of the day, I didn't even really have a set goal when writing this out. I just needed to write somewhere, whether it's seen by people or not -- in that way, reddit is a fun medium for me to write on because even in the moments where I know I won't get a response, I still feel like I have an audience, or someone out there listening. \n\nI feel like someone caught by the undertow at a beach, struggling to breathe in the midst of all of this. Am I saying I suffer from a post-traumatic disorder? God no, not literally after one week of this. Hell, maybe this doesn't even belong on a CPTSD subreddit -- but I cannot help to feel like I am undergoing a life-changing realization that explains years and years of my life.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"CPTSD","subreddit_id":"t5_2vvid","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/CPTSD","subreddit_subscribers":33376,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"it's been a wild week","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CPTSD\/comments\/bjbez5\/its_been_a_wild_week\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I knew the whole time we were dating that he struggled with substance abuse, but was initially under the impression that he had detoxed and was sober now. Well after I had moved in with her and him I slowly began to realize that he's not truly sober because his mother has been enabling him by giving him painkillers every night. She's said multiple times that he's much better than before and this way at least he's home doing it. I understand from extensive research and personal knowledge about addiction that this is enabling and codependent behaviour on her end. And when I've tried to bring this up to my fianc\u00e8 he gets pissed that I act like he's an addict when he's doing the best hes ever done. She's moved out now because her mother has gotten to the point she needs someone helping her all the time. But his mindset is still that he doesnt have a problem and his mom still meets him every week to give him a few pills. One day he took one really late at night (like 2 am) when he had to be somewhere at 7 am and when he got up he was still so groggy he was falling asleep standing up so I tried to hide his keys, sat in his truck and refused to move and he got pissed of course and started to rant about me to his mom. He told her things like \"shes making me feel like such a piece of shit junkie. It just makes me want to go back to how I was\" so then MIL starts texting me paragraphs about how I'd better apologize to him and work this out, if anything happens to him or he goes back to the harder drugs he did then it'll be my fault, if he overdoses then it's my fault. I'm obviously just as mad at my fianc\u00e8 because he needs to be the one that decides he has a problem and to get help but it really doesnt help how MIL is always making excuses for him, enabling him, and making me the bad guy. Anyways...I dont really know how to handle it. Like I said I'm 6 months pregnant and I've told him if there's a single incident where he's high after our baby is here that I will leave him that moment without hesitation. He said he understands and it won't happen but I have my doubts. I want to be able to be a family because truly he would make the most amazing father, hes a very sensitive man and has been very emotional and empathetic with me the whole pregnancy. He really loves his baby and has all the characteristics I wanted in the father of my child but I can't allow anything to happen to my baby if he's high and drowsy and not attentive enough to handle being a new dad.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"JUSTNOMIL","subreddit_id":"t5_377ps","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/JUSTNOMIL","subreddit_subscribers":871552,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I don't really know how to get over my resentment for my enabling FMIL","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/JUSTNOMIL\/comments\/bjbfs6\/i_dont_really_know_how_to_get_over_my_resentment\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I'm hoping there's someone relatively local who might help me get over this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess it's time for a bit about me. I'm 6'4, 110kg (about 17.5 stone), brown hair, clean shaven and a bit baby faced. I work full time and enjoy cooking, gaming and combat sports. I have a flat but sadly no dog yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for what I'm looking for, physically I have no preferences and age or experience doesn't matter. I would like to actually get on with the person though, maybe we could meet for a coffee or something before the actual deed. I would also prefer if it was less of just \"having sex\" and more about experiencing and, more importantly, learning different things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't really think of anything else to add. Hopefully I tick a few boxes for some of you and you get in touch. If not, apologies for stealing a minute of your day but I hope the rest of it is a good one!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"VirginityExchange","subreddit_id":"t5_37f87","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VirginityExchange","subreddit_subscribers":24048,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"26 [M4F] [Glasgow, Scotland UK] Looking to learn.","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VirginityExchange\/comments\/bjbg1g\/26_m4f_glasgow_scotland_uk_looking_to_learn\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder without cognitive deficits as an adult back in February 2016. \n\nBut. \n\nI cannot learn in a classroom setting. I've tried since high school and I just can't. I can't handle regurgitating useless info anymore. It's just not my thing. I also have trouble simultaneously learning and being in public as of now. I keep failing out of classes and I can't even get past precalc 1 at community college. Now. I'm only currently pursuing an associate's so I'm not even that far in,  so I wanna figure this stuff out before I have to sign up for next semester.\n\nWhat I want to do for a living:  \nI would love be able to diagnose and repair parts on circuit boards via multi-meter and soldering iron. With this I would buy reparable phones and other electronics. I'd then refurbish and resell them on my website. I would also like to do DIY circuit building for a few inventions I have in mind and put them up on my website for sale. I watch youtube channels like Louis Rossman if that offers any guidance in where I need to go. He's honestly my favorite person on youtube. He's the one who inspired me to pursue the degree in the first place. Such a great guy. Because of him, I purchased a cheapo solder set last spring. I basically have all of the gear I would need to practice. I think. I probably need a better soldering iron though.\n\nMy related skills. I can:  \n\\-perform simple iphone and android smartphone disassembly and screen and battery replacement\n\n\\-on paper, apply ohm's law, power rule, etc. to analyze diagrams of AC series\/parallel\/series-parallel and DC series\/parallel\/series-parallel circuits.\n\n\\-use basic functions of a multi-meter\n\nSo I know the fundamentals of circuitry.  \n\n\nAnyway, I guess my question is: What is the best online degree or program should I go for?

The other guy is this big hulking dude that came from the BJJ class, that was called in to train up for the State's judo tournament (we have sort of a partnership with the BJJ class, in that we sometimes swap students for tournaments if they have the credentials to participate in them), I think he has an orange belt (brazilian ranking system) in judo but he's switched to BJJ half a decade ago so he had to brush up on his throwing skills.\n\nThe first half of the session was a lengthy 20 minute \"warm up\" consisting of running, jumping jacks, sit-ups, and pushups, followed by harai-goshi drilling, for about an hour, I was paired with the aikido guy, who was learning O-soto-gari, we took turns, me throwing him Harai-goshi, him sweeping my leg with an O-soto-gari. That bit of the training went fine, he couldn't really throw me that hard, I guess that's due to the whole aikido background, I helped him make some adjustments to his technique and by the end he could do it pretty well.\n\nNow the second half was an Uchi-mata drill and I was paired with the BJJ dude, I figured I'd see how he could throw me so I told him \"you go first man\".\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not exactly a veteran, but I take some pride in being a hard bastard to hurt, I've taken more nasty falls than most of the class and I'm generally the one that gets up first and goes \"alright, lets do this\".\n\nBut still, that was a horrible mistake\n\nThis dude threw me like a goddamn sack of potatoes. So when I slammed against the mat I thought to myself \"well, there goes my r\/neverbrokeabone membership\", but when I got up, I was still in one piece, we kept at it for 30 minutes, it was hell, I eventually realized that it wasn't due to how hard he was throwing me, but the way he was throwing me, remember when I told you that this dude had to brush up on his throwing skills? Well, that comes into play here.\n\nHe was trying to do a hip throw, it was kinda like koshi-guruma or hane-goshi only he would reap my leg up in the air, so I would fall all weird like. We fixed that with 3 minutes left till the end of the class. I'm back home now, I'm bruised like a motherfucker, my hips hurt like I'm 70 and I feel like I was just hit with a baseball bat on the spine.\n\nOverall it was an enlightening experience, 10\/10 would do it again.\n\nEdit: Today I found out that the Jiu-Jitsu dude hasn't grappled in years and is actually the club's wushu instructor, IT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"judo","subreddit_id":"t5_2qkzy","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/judo","subreddit_subscribers":25547,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"So today I've tasted the two extremes of hos hard can I get thrown down to the floor.","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/judo\/comments\/bjbkz8\/so_today_ive_tasted_the_two_extremes_of_hos_hard\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I've been too afraid to ask my family to allow me to seek out therapy or any mental health counseling of the sort, since my mom happens to be the type of person who believes mental health issues are just \"made up\" by the person and that they'll eventually \"get over it\" themselves after awhile (a very inconsiderate and disheartening mindset to a teenager). Because of that attitude, I was raised mostly keeping my thoughts pertaining to these types of things to myself with no one to really open up to, so I'm just not accustomed to sharing such personal and deep aspects of my own life to other people, let alone a therapist or psychologist that I'm not acquainted with whatsoever. I already have a difficult time opening up to close friends about these issues, since I always end up believing I'm bothering or overwhelming them whenever I try to share these kinds of personal thoughts. I've been feeling extremely uncomfortable with informing anyone ever since I first attempted to ask a friend for help or advice, only to have them brush me off with a shrug saying, \"Sorry, I can't help you\" (I've been reluctant to tell anyone I know since then, since I really don't want to be rejected again; that incident caused me some emotional pain). I can't ask my parents either, because my mom will simply overreact or brush me off as being irrational and not contribute at all.\n\nI think I have an idea of a potential disorder I may have after some extensive personal research (Avoidant Personality Disorder), though I'm definitely not qualified to make any official statements about specific disorders, of course, and am really unsure of what to do in terms of seeking help and being professionally evaluated. I don't want to end up being forced to tell my parents, since I don't want them to view me any differently or for my mom to blame me for \"acting up\" (or make some other irrational conclusion along those lines). Some of my friends at school have suggested for me to consult my school's mental health counselor as a first step, but I'm just too frightened by the notion of having to speak up about all these personal thoughts I've kept to myself to a complete stranger. I'll probably get the feeling that I'm \"annoying\" them, even though I logically know it's their job to speak with such individuals, which will still make me feel more uncomfortable with sharing. For starters, I honestly just want to know if I really do have a mental health problem or if I'm just explaining my own behavior and thinking incorrectly. Are there any suggestions anyone may have for my situation and what I should do?\n\n(And yes, I do understand that most diagnoses of AvPD are for those over the age of 18, but I really do feel like many of the symptoms pertaining to the disorder apply to me personally. I apologize if it seems like I'm jumping to conclusions too abruptly, though.)\n\nThank you in advance to anyone who replies!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"askatherapist","subreddit_id":"t5_3bhkf","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/askatherapist","subreddit_subscribers":2898,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I want to consult a therapist, but I'm too afraid to.","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askatherapist\/comments\/bjbnta\/i_want_to_consult_a_therapist_but_im_too_afraid_to\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I walked in wearing an Old Navy hoodie, baggy jeans and a blue lanyard around my neck with my house keys attached. From a glance MAYBE I could've been mistaken for an employee from a distance, but right up close it was pretty obvious I was a child considering I was under 5 feet tall, had in pigtails and was wearing Bratz dolls light up sneakers.\n\nSo my Baba and I make our way back to the kids section to look for some shorts. My Baba is Really short and has a bad knee so she was pointing at certain stuff on the taller shelves for me to reach. (Try and reach at least.) We were there for about a two minutes before this man walks up holding a little girls hand (about 7) and carrying another little girl (about 3) on his side.\n\nLost Dad: Excuse me? Do you know where I could find girls shoes?\n\nMe, being familiar with the store: Yeah. There around the corner on the far wall.\n\nThe Dad walks off without another word and I keep shopping. I thought nothing of it since people around my area are really friendly and polite so I just thought maybe he asked me because I'm legit and child and would know where the children's shoes are. A few minutes later my Baba and I moved to the shirt section where again, my Baba had me getting stuff down from the racks, checking sizes. All that jazz. The dad comes back to the kids isle with two boxes in one hand and his toddler in the other.\n\nLost Dad: Do you guys have any shopping carts?\n\nMe, without thinking: Yep. There by the front, but if your lucky there might be some empty ones near the dressing rooms.\n\nLost Dad: Thanks.\n\nWe continue doing our own thing through the store until my Baba's knee starts hurting and she tells me shes gonna find somewhere to sit down while I pick out some t-shirts from the boys section since all the ones in the girls section were hideous and covered in glitter and this was right at the peak of my graphic tee obsession. So I waltz over and start pilfering though the stacks of clothes, folding them and putting them back nicely after I was done looking cuz I'm not a heathen and I respect retail workers, and the dad comes whipping around the corner with a cart full of clothes and two children. (Not in the basket part where you can sit your kid so there facing you. These kids were sitting in the shopping cart with all the clothes in there laps.) He spots me and charges over with the determination of a man with a plan. And points at me with a box of glittery pink sandles.\n\nLost Dad: Hey. Can you help me find these shoes in a different size?\n\nI just stood there for a good 30 seconds smiling like an idiot not sure if I should help the man cuz I was raised to be nice to people and always respect your elders, or to tell him to find a worker cuz I was also raised to not go with strangers and to be careful who I talk to. \n\nDad, still holding the box of sandles out at me: Excuse me! I asked you a question! Do you have any more of these? He starts waving the box around my head in a circular motion. Dad: Helloooooooo!\n\nI snap out of my confused smiling stance and take a couple steps back cuz this box of sandles was about two inches from hitting me in the face. \nMe: Sorry sir. I cant help you. But there's a customer service booth near the dressing rooms. You should ask someone there.\n\nI turn around and start heading back to my Baba when I hear a Thunk! From behind me. I whip around and this grown ass man has thrown the box of sandles down in my direction.\nDad: Seriously?! I'm not asking a lot! It's not that hard to check the back! You stupid teens have no respect!\n\nI'm just standing there slack jawed staring at this man while he fails his arm around and begins to go on a rant about customer care and lazy workers. Literally flailing his arms in the air like one of those blow up dolls in front of car lots.\nDad: Un-Fucking-Believable. You know what?! I wanna speak to your manager! Your not gonna get away with being lazy and disrespectful to me!\n\nI laughed. Out loud. He heard and narrows his eyes at me. Dad: Excuse Me?! Is Something Funny?! I Want To Speak To Your Manager! Right Now!\n\nHe reaches into the shopping cart, grabs another box of shoes and slams them down on the floor. The kids in the shopping cart? Completely unfazed. An ACTUAL employee turns the corner just as the box of shoes hits the ground and turns to face him.\nEmployee: Hey! That's store property!\nDad: You! I want you to get your manager! This chick refused to help me! And then gave me attitude! I want her written up!\n\nThe employee turns to face me and cuz shes not an idiot instant knows I'm not a worker and in fact just a lost, confused child in pigtails and blinky shoes. She looks at the Dad again. Then looks back at me. Then back at the Dad. \nEmployee: Sir. She's doesn't work here.\n\nHe looks over at me. So does the employee. There both silent for a good 30 seconds before the employee takes a few steps towards me.\nEmployee: How old are you?\n\nMe: 11.\n\nThe Dads jaw drops. He stutters a bit then takes off around the corner with his cart as fast as he can without hitting anything. The employee turns after him telling him something about apologizing and destruction of store property. I walked back to my Baba who was sitting patiently at the dressing rooms and told her the whole story. Apparently the escorted the man out and gave us a coupon but I dont remember that part.\n\nSorry for the anticlimactic ending but I thought I'd share it.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IDontWorkHereLady","subreddit_id":"t5_341k1","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IDontWorkHereLady","subreddit_subscribers":471947,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I don't work here.

Two years ago, I met this guy on Grindr and we met for hookup. In the first meeting itself we felt a connection and we started talking chatting etc. On day-1 he honestly told me that he is married to a women ( Which happened 6 years ago due to family pressure ) and has a 5 year old son. As we were in starting phase, we both really didnt care. we met for two months everyday and spent amazing time in every aspect. we had the best time roaming around, eating cooking and every small thing we could do along with fun in all the time we could get. Two months ended and we realized that we are falling in love so we discuss that whats next?  and we realize that there is no future for us. but we are deeply in love. I leave the city to go back to studies and we think that we will eventually breakup. But long distance relation goes on. At this stage I am 26yo, male in closet who doesnt know what he wants to do with his life. I was struggling with my sexuality, hiding basically. But i knew I am gay. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for 1 complete year we stay in long distance, chat everyday, call everyday with just 1 meeting in person for 2 days in that whole year. We were so much deeply in love that I looked for my full time job in same city and came back to his town after a year. In last 1 year as I go to school, focused on career, getting a job and studies so didnt think much about future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I get a job and come back and we start meeting again. As I graduate I start getting family pressure and self pressure to think about what i really want to do. After 6 months of struggle I came out to my family. My bf stood by me for my worst times for whole last 1.5 year. Loving me, taking care of me in this new city. You can say doing everything he can do with his marriage. His wife dont know yet. we are in secret relationship. As soon as i come out, I started feeling about my future. I felt that i really want to have a life partner whom I can live with. Although I meet with him every 1-2 days for 1-2 hours and we chat, call almost whole day but i started getting a feel that i cant spend whole life like this. So i went to him and told him that i want to marry you but i know i cant marry you as you are already a married. We discuss everything and he says that he cant leave his wife and two kids as it will spoil their whole life and he doesnt want to build a new relation by leaving those innocent souls. I agree and he agrees that I should look for a life partner. So we mutually decide to break apart with no fight. but within few days in which he goes through a lot of pain, he comes back and proposes that he is ready to get committed to me and live in a secret relationship for whole life like this. he says that he will keep meeting me and hiding like this, take care of me and try to do best to keep me happy. but i tell him that I want a normal life like a partner, to be able to live with him in house and accept him openly, not hide everyday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decline this proposal and he says that I dont love him and I cheated him for 2 years. As his logic is last two years I was fine with him but today suddenly when I came out my expectations changed and I want more ( which is to be able to live with him). He says i knew from day 1 that he cant do that still i used him. Which is not the case bcoz from day 1 he knew i am single and  i might come out and think of marriage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nme, personally always wanted to marry and have a normal happy life. But he thinks if my love is true How can i leave him for this reason ? he thinks that its not a good enough reason. We have been goign through endless discussion since last 4 weeks but we are not able to reach to agreement. He is in a very mental state and always sad and he feels cheated. he thinks that i am selfish and not thinking about him. I feel that how i can stay like this extra marrital affair whole life? I love him and i want to marry him openly but I dont want to miss him everyday when he goes back home. He is not happy either in marriage but he is doing it for sake of his parents and society. he thinks that he shouldnt leave wife and kids as it will spoil their whole life as they are dependent on him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe says he loves me and cant live without me. I dont knwo what should i do now ? What is true love is ? Is it wrong to leave my true love just because we cant live together in one roof? Am i doing wrong with him ? I love him as a person and ready to marrry him but dont want to be hidden. bcoz i dont feel free. After we meet he always has to run home, we can never spend a night together. only 1-2 days in a year we have spent whole night. we do have sex often and its great. But i want to be his life partner like normally people are. Live with him a basic life in same house. I am ready for commitment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same moment I am scared that if I am doing wrong? I am leaving the gem which I have, who loves me for the sake of a life partner in this gay world which might not even happen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally confused to what to do? if I am right? whats true love? how much I should sacrifice for it?  please help","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"gayrelationships","subreddit_id":"t5_2v2rt","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/gayrelationships","subreddit_subscribers":1308,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Looking for help !","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gayrelationships\/comments\/bjbsph\/looking_for_help\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

You go on Reddit nowadays to look for pictures of cute animals, read horrifying news articles about what's happening overseas, and post fan theories about Endgame. It never really occurred to me that there was a place for dating on Reddit. And to be perfectly honest with you, I'm desperate. I've tried tons of different dating sites and apps, without very much luck. OkCupid, PlentyofFish, Tinder, Bumble... you name it, I've probably been on it. It's been a long, painfully dry spell for me of being single. Anyway, sometimes you've just gotta say what the hell, right? Let's give this a shot.\n\nMy name is Sean. I'm 23 years old, and I currently live in Pennsylvania. I'm here to find the Leslie to my Ben. Or the Pam to my Jim, whichever you prefer. My hobbies are writing, playing guitar, reading, cooking, and playing baseball. My dream is to someday become a full-time writer, or to have a best-selling novel. Some of my favorite shows are The Office, Parks and Recreation, Arrested Development, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and Seinfeld. I listen to a lot of music, but mostly rock. Some of my favorite artists are The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Foo Fighters, Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones. \n\nSomething about me that people may not know is that I'm autistic. I was diagnosed when I was 14 years old, and it's honestly something I've both struggled with and accepted. Personally, I would love to someday become an advocate for autism, and I've already started making waves of my own on that front. Relationships are kinda complicated for me, I don't really open up very easily to people and I find it hard to communicate frequently. But that's not to say that I'm not working on it, because I've felt like I'm a lot better at communicating than I was when I was a teenager. I'm also very introverted, and I like my alone time but sometimes it gets a bit lonely.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this is someone who is kind, compassionate, intelligent, hard-working, funny, and fun to be around. I hope that we can have intellectual discussions, heart-to-heart conversations, and that we can find some mutual interests. If you feel like you're that kind of person, feel free to message me. And even if you don't feel like you're that person, you can message me too. My inbox is always open to anyone who needs somebody to talk to, no matter the time or the day.\n\nAnd while I'm at it, here are [some](https:\/\/ibb.co\/QbwrF9g) [pictures](https:\/\/ibb.co\/j4kRkC8) [of](https:\/\/ibb.co\/LZzL8tP) [my](https:\/\/ibb.co\/4PCZDDK) [mug.](https:\/\/ibb.co\/LP6h3Jn)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"r4r","subreddit_id":"t5_2rn0e","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/r4r","subreddit_subscribers":241188,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"23 [M4F] Pennsylvania - Looking for the Leslie Knope to my Ben Wyatt.","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/r4r\/comments\/bjbu1d\/23_m4f_pennsylvania_looking_for_the_leslie_knope\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Was upset over a girl, trivial freshman year high school shit, and my buddy swore I'd feel better if I just hit that joint! So I did, and I did feel great. So I sought that feeling again, and again, and again. Weed wasn't as accessible for me individually though, so this was kept as a social thing I did with my friends at the time. It was never painted in a negative light, or should i say in an honest light. It was always a cool and chill thing to do, we didn't really question it or consider any long term effects.\n\nFast forward to 18: I've got my own job, a new girlfriend I've been with for about two years, she burned too, but not quite as much as I did, I was buying eighths nearly once a month and it was becoming a daily thing for me. The relationship was toxic, I can take fault as reflecting on my words and behavior I did not deserve anyone. Eventually she wised up, and cut it off for good.\n\nThis hurt, really fucking bad. It didn't really hit me too hard at first, but after a few weeks I realized I was alone as far as \"love\" went. I was never able to share any intimacy with my guy friends, or my older brother or even my parents for that matter. I was very bad with showcasing affection. So how did I cope? I'd smoke, and I smoked every day, every night. I never let it get in the way of work, but you bet I was loading that bowl or bong as soon as I got home. Fast food jobs, shitty delivery driver jobs, I didn't care if they were dead end jobs because I knew I could go home and get high when the shift was over. \n\nThis was great, I really can't lie. I would say it was still in that honey moon phase with THC, where you still attribute it to good, and you begin to think hey maybe this is good for me, this is really helping me feel better. I was playing video games, hanging out with my few guy friends when I could, working,  living with my parents, and getting high every chance I got. \n\nI had aspirations still, I had always dreamt of being a rapper (lol I know its cheesy but I have always really enjoyed writing and seemed to have a natural skill with free styling off the top and presenting my rhymes well). Just to make it doing something I enjoyed, something I had actual passion for. It's surreal to think of watching my favorite internet personalities grind and become more famous than I could have imagined. While I sat dormant and high in a recliner...\n\nNow there were some moments of realization, reflecting on the usage, and thinking maybe it wasn't such a good idea to be using an illegal drug so frequently. These were never bold enough to enforce me to quit altogether. So this was basically my life, up until 22 almost 23. \n\nFriends invited me to a little gathering with some card games, had a new friend I'd never met staying at their place, so I figured I'd stop by, play some games, have some beers, and maybe make a new friend! This girl and I actually hit it off so well, and I can only equate this to a miracle as my social skills were (and still are) pretty terrible due to hibernating in my room at my parent's while high for nearly 4 consecutive years. We planned to hangout in a few days with my friend and his girlfriend. They bailed though, and she still invited me out to dinner. I was smoking after hearing the plans bailed, so I'm high as fuck, totally dreading any social interaction, but I managed to muster up whatever energy I had left to go and have dinner with this girl.\n\nIt was terrible, I was such an awkward and socially anxious mess of a human. Somehow she saw something else in me that night though, and I can happily say we are still together to this day! This girl is very smart academically, incredibly cute, and seemed to bring light into my life that I forgot existed. After we started hanging out regularly, there was a span of two or three days where I didn't smoke because it just did not occur to me. I'll add that by this point I had invested in a desktop vape, so at least I was kind of conscious about my intake. \n\nFast forward a bit more, she moves in with me at my parents, and we plan to get our own place in a month or so. Success! I'm still smoking daily throughout this, but mostly during night hours after working. Even being a \"sober head\", for lack of a better term, she never judged me about my use, always supported me.\n\nRoughly 2 years later, I'm 24 years old, it's October of 2018. I live in Panama City, FL, and a giant fucking hurricane (Michael) is heading right towards my small town. News channel didn't show us in an evacuation zone, projected it to go a different direction almost. However, this bad boy decided to go RIGHT over Panama city. So my girlfriend, our cat, and myself are bunkered in the bathroom of our second story 1 bedroom apartment waiting for this storm to pass.\n\nThis had to be the scariest shit of my life, giant pine trees were behind our units, and during the storm at least 2 had fallen on the roof and it started to fall into the apartment. Water was getting in, and at this point I knew our lovely, comfortable, little apartment was going to be fucked.\n\nSo after this, I reunite with my parents, brother, and few friends to make sure everyone is okay. Make a plan with the girlfriend to move as the town was, and still is to this day, pretty damn devastated. During this time I had a distillate cart and I stretched that shit out like a yoga expert. About 2 days before my flight though, I threw it out and vowed to quit. \n\nGet to Arizona, as my girlfriend's hometown was in Mesa and she still had friends over here. Staying in a giant custom built house as her best friend's parents were filthy fucking rich and kind enough to give us a room and place to stay for the time being. I'm going strong at this point, not smoking, not thinking about it, just wanting to get back on my feet and establish my new life in AZ.\n\nObtain a car, obtain a job, and eventually get ourselves a nice 1 bedroom place! After a month or so of this comfort, and around 2 months of abstaining from THC, I stumble upon a source of weed and take the God damn dive again. Vaped an eighth of bud, then bought a gram of shatter, then I found a source for more distillate carts (loved these as they were discreet, no smell, and super convenient). \n\nSo yesterday morning I'm smoking on the second cart I had purchased after finishing one after 3 or 4 weeks, and it straight up leaks out of both ends. This is a weird eye opener for me, as I'm still in an illegal state and truly do not know exactly what the fuck is in this cart that I'm so willfully inhaling every 20 or 30 minutes. Decide to throw the shit away, and asked the guy immediately if he could get me another. Thought for an hour, and called off that request to try once again at sobriety! I do say sobriety seriously as I've also recently surpassed 60 days with no alcohol, and 2 weeks with no caffeine. This is the last vice to cut out completely and begin to be myself again.\n\nIt is insane to look back over a span of 10 years and see that I did nothing substantial. I didn't focus my creative energy towards anything long term, I just worked dead end jobs and prioritized getting high to feel artificial comfort and contentment. I could have MASTERED any thing if I had put even half as much energy and effort into it as I did into getting high...\n\nAnd this is where I am now. Day 1, worked 11 hours, and I would fucking love a hit of some THC, but I know I'm better without it. I want to see what I'm really capable of, I want to deal with my emotions, the good and the bad, instead of extinguishing them in fear. I'm ready to take control of my life now.\n\nI didn't expect to write so much, I guess I didn't realize how much I truly wanted to put into words. If anyone out there reads this all, I really appreciate it. I hope someone can relate to this, or gets something out of my own subjective experience with the ol' devil's lettuce. Or just enjoys it, as I've never really tried to share my experiences in depth.\n\nTL:DR - smoked regularly for 10 years, some phases more than others, finally realized I'm leading a life of mediocrity and wanted to be better. Nearing the end of day 1, here's to a future of clarity and growth.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"leaves","subreddit_id":"t5_2s9i3","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/leaves","subreddit_subscribers":95332,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Hopefully My Last Day One","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/leaves\/comments\/bjbxmo\/hopefully_my_last_day_one\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

Starts walking out the door and drops this bombshell: \"oh yea, I comped a room.\" \n\nMe: umm why? Did you talk to *other supervisor* because I never got a call? \n\nHer: oh, I didn't talk to anyone about it. \n\nMe: .... So you comped a room on a weekend when we are a completely full hotel? We could have sold the room full price 5 times since I got here. Why did you comp the room?\n\nHer: well this couple has this baby and the baby has asthma. Someone on the third floor was smoking and their baby couldn't breathe. So I moved them rooms and comped them a night. \n\nMe (thinking) alright, that's not so bad. Baby breathing trumps having someone else possibly pay full price for a room. I still probably wouldn't have comped the room though unless they made a fuss about it. \n\nMe: well did you figure out who was smoking? \n\nHer: well no. I didn't wanna go up to the third floor. \n\nMe (thinking): well this got bad again. \n\nMe: well then did you at least call the 24hr housekeeper to get the room cleaned? (We still had a couple check ins and like I said, it was a full hotel). \n\nHer: noo? \n\nSo she left, I call the 24hr housekeeper and go up to the room to start stripping the bed so the hk has less to do.
