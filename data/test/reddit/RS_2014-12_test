A few months later on 9/11/01 I heard the same sounds I did in June 2001 on the TV as two planes flew into the WTC. I ended up on disability in 2003.\n\nI live near the Ferguson area, and the riots, looting, and burning down of buildings really get to me as they destroy the local economy and put good people out of work.\n\nI don't drink or smoke, I try to live a clean lifestyle. I don't get this pot legalization which is soon to be put up for a vote in Missouri. Modern music gets on my nerves because they use autotune and add in stuff to the music that shouldn't be there. Modern movies and TV shows are basically crap as far as I am concerned. They are marketed to a low level functioning demographic and I am high functioning and most of it makes fun of high functioning people.\n\nIt seems I cannot hide my mental illness, but most people seem to think I am autistic like high level Asperger's or something and treat me like shit because of it. I lost a lot of friends and my family has basically disowned me. So many people tell me to do society a favor and kill myself that I lost count of how many people told me that.\n\nI feel like I drift out of this universe and into another one. I sleep most of the day and have problems waking up. I am on a lot of medicine which costs a lot and disability doesn't cover it all and I end up in a doughnut hole with a lot of medical debt.\n\nI tried to write books on Kindle but that didn't work out, now that I am 46 I am too old to be hired as a programmer and I am 12+ years out of date with programming because I focused on my health instead.\n\nI really don't want to kill myself or end up on alcohol or pot or other drugs like so many have done.

In high school I was around 130 and I loved it, was pretty confident. My freshman year of college I went up to 155 and my weight stayed pretty stable around there. I'm 5'6\" by the way. Just graduated in May, worked with a personal trainer over the summer but my weight only ever got down to like 150 or didn't really move (it varies based on the day).\n\nSo I moved to Thailand about two months ago and now I weigh about 170 pounds. I'm not okay with this in any way. It's very frustrating because I exercise (running) every other day and on off days I walk around 16,000 to 20,000 steps (I have no car in my town and the nearest store is three miles away). The only thing I'm not doing is drinking a ton of water, which I know is terrible but can it really just make me gain weight?\n\nThe food situation is a little hard, because the Thais put a lot of oil and sugar in their food. But I'm also only eating yogurt for breakfast, most dinners I eat healthy veggies and some protein. Lunch I eat at my school cafeteria and I don't know what's in it but it's usually some chicken and veggies in rice and some fruit. I very occasionally have a chocolate bar or a bag of chips (like once a week) that I buy from the store 3 miles away from my home. \n\nI don't understand why this is happening. It is not muscle. Every time I tell someone I'm gaining weight they say, \"Oh, it's muscle,\" but it isn't. Please help me, I feel like crying all the time.

I was the FRONT FUCKING PAGE of myex.com (20000 views), and they finally deleted it after I sent them 5 underage complaints including 3 DMCA complaints. \n\nIf you didn't read the back story, I was 17 when I was lured by what I thought was a modelling website to send them topless photos (polaroid style). I'm 22 now, and I obviously know how dumb I was, but I did NOT expect the photos to ever surface especially 5 years later. And alas they did. I should've figured that it was only a matter of time. So anyways, this guy has hacked my phone and taken lingerie photos that I've sent to my girlfriends (to ask them for advice on what to buy, it's not THAT weird) and he posted them online a few days ago. On Thanksgiving. What a fun holiday that was. \n\nBasically, it's taking EVERYTHING in me not to chop his dick off and shove it down his throat, but everyone says to be patient and wait til I have cold hard evidence so I can actually get him into legal trouble. I know if I said something to him now that he would stop and be horribly embarrassed, but I want him to burn. He's terrorized me for the past 5 months by making fake profiles and sending out all my pictures to my friends and family and I literally feel sick to my stomach every single day. My question is: I'm in Europe right now til the 20th. I can't get legal help until I go to the station in person. How do I catch him without making it obvious that I know about it? I need something that undeniably proves it's him. Thank you!!!\n\nEDIT: The IP address that I've found through the e-mail exchanges is a cover-up. It links to Microsoft in Redmond, Washington.\n\nAlso, I'm from Ohio.

Using a throwaway because I'd rather not have online friends recognize me and bother me about this later on..\n\nSo, this story starts 5 years ago I suppose. Actually I guess it's closer to 12 years ago when I had my first day at school. What started as a childish argument about wanting to be friends with the same person, I started my own personal hell for the next 7 years of school. Weekly beatings by various people, incidents such as being thrown face-first down a sand covered ice slide, a friend taking a hit for me and losing a tooth, the list goes on and on throughout my first years of school. I grew accustomized to not really having a lot of social contact with anyone around me and spent most of my time reading and trying to not piss anyone off just by being alive.\n\nFast forward to 13 year old me. This is where things get really interesting. I get placed in a class with what I can only describe as the social rejects. We're all different types of people, but our main thing in common seems to be our inability to get along with our peers and make friends. For some of my classmates these would be the best 3 years of their life - but for me it was just the start of another hellish march through another school. It started in my 8th grade year in the winter when I got called in to the social teacher's (ST) office for a 'talk'. Apparently, I've been bullying no less than three girls in my class, and it gets better. The ST and I have a few meetings throughout the course of my 8th grade year until I realize that she has been telling those girls everything I told her in confidence and thus just gave them more material to make *my* life more miserable than it already was - between being harassed and discriminated against by one of my teachers and these three having **actual** dirt on me about various things that I went through previously.\n\nIn my 9th grade year I decide to transfer away from what was possibly my easiest time so far. As always, it gets better. One of my parents is diagnozed with Borderline Personality Disorder (as far as I know, after all I'm not told anything. This was mentioned by my other parent during a drive specifically). This parent has a history of anger management issues and during my 10th grade year this parent (A) gradually spiraled into a 4 year old. During this time, my other parent (B) is working away from home more often than not and even when working at home B would be home around 8pm normally. This leaves me alone at home with 4 year old mentality A for 5-6 hours a day. A becomes gradually more problematic (refusing to cook food, refusing to buy groceries, making impossible demands) and juggling this along with school and constant harssment from B about many things (getting 'fat' when I'm only ~130 pounds, comments about my looks and needing more exercise and so on - in addition to verbal abuse when I could only complete 9 out of 10 chores and such) and I fall into my real first pitfall of horribly suicidal thoughts. A is doing ~10+ types of medicines to cope with various injuries in addition to being obese and diabetic and depressed/BPD and the only thing I can think about every day is how easy it would be to be done with it. The lack of support from my parents throughout the years and the constant pressure of having to maintain grades/satisfying a 4 year old A/coping with harassment from B just left me exhausted and I went back to my habit of escaping into games.\n\nAfter graduating from 10th grade, A has gotten a lot better after the awful year of mood swings, but I've simply lost any will do perform well academically. Once I realized during 10th grade that B really has no time to have a sick child or a child that can't 'perform' I lost the ability to care about anything including myself. When an A or a B is \"ok\" and anything below that is \"you clearly didn't try hard enough\" even when you give it your all everything just stops having any real importance. At least it did to me. I started skipping school a lot to stay home and sleep, and I still spend the majority of my time just sleeping everything away. My second year was the same, I started seeing a psychiatrist about my thoughts and feelings, despite the ST from 4 years ago ruining any kind of trust I am able to have in these sort of people. After ~10-15 60 minute sessions, my psychiatrist concludes that she can't help me - and strongly recommends family therapy (psychiatrist's conclusion was that I was in fact depressed, but the underlying reason was not me but my family and thus she did not want to medicate me and she also said future sessions would be pointless as she couldn't fix me without fixing my parents first). At this point I'm 17 and I ask her to mail B about it - because just me saying it doesn't matter to B at all, because B doesn't have time to listen to my issues and problems. B gets the mail and promises me on several occasions to set up a session with the recommended therapist, but even today (over a year later) we have yet to see a family therapist and B shows little to no interest about my well-being.\n\nThis year I started my 3rd and final year. I've skipped 60% of my classes and after talking with a school advisor, we made a plan for the rest of my 3rd year and started plans for better physical and emotional treatment and so on.\n\nThis finally brings me to the current situation. I'm  18F and today I (once again) thought about just ending it. I haven't mentioned it before, but I have an older sibling (C) whom I lived with for a short while to escape everything. B was very negative towards this and because of that I was only able to stay 3 weeks, but those 3 weeks were the best weeks of my life. \n\nToday I was once again mocked by A and B. I was *yelled at* for the classic \"you only completed 9/10 of the chores I asked about\" and I was also threatened to get kicked out because I said I needed ~10 min to finish up something before I could help with that last chore. The whole scenario ends with B confronting me and reaffirming my firm belief that B not so secretly hates me. I realize how this may all just sound like I'm a whiny kid not wanting to do chores or not being able to take a few negative words, but I have dealt with constant emotional abuse from BOTH parents since a very young age and I really have no one to rely on for anything. When people look at my family from the outside it's a nice house with a pretty garden and 2 kids and a pet, but within these 4 walls I endure daily abuse and it has once again brought me to the point where all I can do is curl up into a little ball and cry for 50 minutes until I am able to calm down and do something else. I decided to start writing a diary today where I document the treatment I endure, and I will be writing in this daily.\n\nOnce B finds out I've skipped 60% of school and that I don't even have any grades right now, B will probably go on a rampage and I may even get kicked out from home. B will find out this summer when I'm supposed to graduate and they inform B that I still have 1 year left before I can graduate due to cutting my workload in half to complete this year and get at least some grades. I'm thinking it's just easier to kill myself and be done with it before then so I don't have to deal with being homeless. I just don't have the will or desire to keep living my life past 18 years. I just wanted to leave this out here so someone knows I was alive at some point in the future, because I doubt anyone but C would care if I just died. \n\nSorry if I somehow violate any rules of this subreddit, I'm not at all familiar with it and I just wanted someone to listen to me for once in my life I guess.. Thank you for reading.","media":null,"ups":2,"retrieved_on":1441043891}

My boyfriend [22/M as I said], is in a band and part of his job is networking with other bands and people in the business to get more shows etc. With this comes the unavoidable situation of him being overly friendly with both men and women, but I understand this is just part of his role as a band member so I try not to get jealous when he spends time with other girls. I trust him completely and he is such a sweet guy I don't think he would even be capable of cheating on me even if he wanted to. I'm less concerned with him cheating, but how to handle the situation of getting this random girl to leave him the heck alone!  \n\n\n\nSo, he became friends with this girl [19/F] in a popular band in our music scene which was very exciting because they have quite a big following.  When he started hanging out with this girl and texting her, it didn't really bother me because of the nature of his job.  \n\n\n\nFast forward a few weeks... I had been gone traveling for school for a few weeks and when I returned I found that this girl was texting my boyfriend and facebook messaging him non-stop. I could see her texts popping up on his phone constantly. I pretended to ignore it because I didn't want to be nosey and make him feel guilty for trying to pursue his music career. Eventually when I realized she was contacting him waaaay more than any other girl he had befriended, I confronted him.  He assured me that they were just friends and they had absolutely no interest in each other; she had a boyfriend after all. Whoo! What a relief!  \n\n\n\nWell, she and her boyfriend recently broke up and the obsessive, constant texting/hanging out etc. has just increased. She seems like she really needs attention and is very lonely at this point because she is not only constantly contacting my boyfriend, but showing up at his house where he and his 4 other guy friends live.  They are all fed-up with her at this point; they really don't want to be friends with her and my boyfriend has starting ignoring her calls/being very short with her in texts if she continuously texts him. She acts all buddy buddy with them and even asked them if she could crash there for a while (they quickly denied her).  \n\n\n\nIt's difficult though because when my boyfriend's band plays a gig she shows up because she sees it on her news feed on facebook or whatever. They are kind of forced to see her and tolerate her being around.  She is particularly infatuated with my boyfriend though, which makes me very uncomfortable.  \n\n\n\nLast night I was helping at one of their shows selling t-shirts, so I couldn't go out and be in the crowd.  Every time my boyfriend left me to go watch the show she would come out of nowhere and automatically be right by his side chatting. At one point he left the venue to go to the liquor store with some of his friends, and out of nowhere I see her running after their group because she saw them leaving. At that point I was like aw helll nah, so I abandoned my post and went after them. I told them I decided I wanted to come and grab a drink too, and immediately she said \"Oh, there are too many people going now, I think I'll stay here.\" So obviously she is trying to be alone with my boyfriend..  \n\n\n\nI talked to my boyfriend after this (he can be so naive sometimes) and told him how crazy she was about him. He wants her gone just as bad as I do, but I don't know if he is afraid of breaking the relationship he has with her band because he hasn't confronted her yet.  I'm also not so sure if I want to confront her because she seems a little unpredictable and unstable right now (potentially violent??? Apparently she slapped my boyfriend in the face as a semi-joke at a show once... I was not around to witness. He told me about it though and I was furious.) I just don't know how to talk to her about how I am annoyed with her constant obsessive and relentless flirty behavior. My boyfriend offered to talk with her too, but I feel bad just passing the chore on to him.  Am I being way too relaxed about my boyfriend's role in this? Should he be telling her up front to leave him the F alone?  \n\n\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading all this. Maybe someone has been in a similar situation before.  \n\n\n---   \n**tl;dr: Girl befriends my boyfriend. She is constantly trying to hang out/talk with my boyfriend and his friends who are sick of her being around.

For example, sometimes when I try on or wear clothes that are more accentuating to my figure, or if my top is a little more revealing, I feel self-conscious/anxious. Or another example, I really like makeup and hair (I'm planning on becoming a cosmetologist) but I hardly wear any make-up because I feel embarrassed when I'm all prettied up. I wanted to buy this red lipstick I saw today, but I was out with my parents and I felt too embarrassed to grab it, so I put it back.

I survived thanksgiving at the boyfriends parents house. I am not the most social person but I said I would make an effort and I did and it wasn't that bad!\nFriday planned to have lunch with my dad and his new girlfriend. My parents recently got divorced. I never see my dad and we have a very rocky relationship. We don't really talk very often and when we do it's about him and all his stuff and he asks me the same 3 questions and then end of phone call. I only told him he had a new grandbaby when the spawn was about 3 months old because you can't have a baby if you're not married! Anyways, we went to lunch, he met boyfriend and boyfriend invited him back to the house. Ughhhh. So the main part is that he has this new girlfriend who is 30 years younger than him. She's 35. I'm 28 and my brother is 31. She lives in Uganda. She was so quiet and I seriously wondered if she even liked him. My dad has tons of money so part of me still thinks that she's a mail order bride or something. But all in all it wasn't terrible. But I can't tell my mom or my brother because my mom is super bitter about my dad(he cheated on her) and my brother didn't know he came to tone because my dad doesn't want to introduce him to his new girlfriend quite yet because unfortunately my brother is slightly racist(terrible I know, but I can't do anything about it). I spoke to my aunt last night and she's telling me that I need to tell everyone about it because when they find out they will be angry at me for knowing the whole time. I have adopted the stance that I will not be the monkey in the middle. I don't expose my moms business to my dad and I won't do the opposite either. I told my parents a while back when they separated that I would not be the messenger in between them. Anywho, I guess it wasn't all that bad of a visit. Just a little weird.\nSaturday: boyfriend gets called out at 4:30am on a job. My child is cranky and terrible and needy. I'm exhausted and haven't showered and my house looks like we threw a frat party. I'm losing my sanity.\nSunday: starting to seriously crack and then my friend came over so I could finally shower! Then I discovered the miracle. I stick the spawn in his jumperoo in front of the tv, turned on Mickey Mouse clubhouse and cleaned the whole downstairs! No shame in my game. I was told on thanksgiving by MIL that I am the one who should clean and not him even though I'm constantly dealing with a sleep deprived super needy cranky baby. Well in your face woman! I did it all even though I did stick my kid in front of a tv to do it. So I finally feel waaaay less gross now that I'm showered and the house is cleaner. But I seriously need another adult in the house again soon. This is his first call out from his job in the oilfield and this constant alone for who knows how long sucks.\nWell this was long and kind of pointless but I haven't seen another adult since Friday night except for 30 minutes which I spent in the shower so you guys are stuck with my randomness. Now if only my child would not wake up every 30 minutes. I'm off to go eat some pizza cause the fish I decided to take out of the freezer didn't defrost cause I'm a dumbass who didn't take it out in time. Hope you ladies had a lovely weekend!"}

But, because I've moved around my whole life across the state multiple times, those friend never stuck with me. \n\nIn high school, I didn't worry too much about not having friends to hang out with on the weekends. In fact, I spent most of my weekends in my freshman, sophomore, and junior years surfing the web and studying for tests. But, this was during the time when Facebook wasn't popular and I thought it was normal for a student to stay home on the weekends. My focus was mainly on attaining good grades and being accepted into a prestigious university. And after getting my acceptance letter in senior year, I hung out with a group of friends (all guys) more whom I still stay in contact with today. We played basketball, video games, and etc. after school and on the weekends and it was an enjoyable period of life.\n\nIn college, I convinced myself that I was going to make more friends who were girls and become more popular. But, I struggled to adapt in freshman year, both academically and emotionally, and it frustrated me so much. The first semester was fun and I had a group of friends who I hung out with all of the time, but once they faded out of the picture and stopped inviting me to hang out, I didn't have anyone else to resort to. I suffered depression from all the things I had to endure and it was truly the lowest point of my life. I contemplated suicide every day and began to question the purpose of life... How do people with a lot of friends get the best of grades in classes? I had neither and I felt like garbage for 6 months. \n\nDepression eventually went away after taking a year of break from school and I went back to college with renewed purpose. I wanted to be more proactive and outgoing and it worked a little better in the beginning, but at the end of the day, I was back to the starting point I was always in. I tried joining a fraternity and other clubs, but I didn't make a single friend... Whenever I tried to be friends with them, I was rejected and I never tried again. The same happened in my junior year and now that I'm in my senior year and I'm 22, I've been looking back at my life and thinking about all the things I could have done differently. I feel like I should have been even more proactive; however, now I think it's too late. I am 22 without friends or a girlfriend or a job or confidence and no matter how optimistic I try to be, I feel hopeless every other day... Recently, I've been feeling more down than ever because I didn't get a single interview for all the job applications I submitted (I want to enter finance and all the bulge bracket companies have been recruiting candidates for the past month), rejected by a girl I bonded with, and the sheer fact that I don't have any friends I connect with... If anyone has experienced a period of life similar to mine, feel free to share any advice or wisdom.\n\nThanks...            \n\n\n ","media":null,"ups":6,"retrieved_on":1441043854,"created_utc":"1417394814","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"getdisciplined","domain":"self.getdisciplined","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"[Needadvice] Feeling hopeless every other day","secure_media_embed":{},"from_id":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/2nw5ao/needadvice_feeling_hopeless_every_other_day/","subreddit_id":"t5_2uzju","from_kind":null,"created":1417394814,"stickied":false,"edited":false,"score":6,"quarantine":false,"num_comments":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2nw5ao","gilded":0,"id":"2nw5ao","archived":true,"from":null,"author":"dhan12","is_self":true}

I love her deeply, and we'd often have conversations about marriage and kids. Yesterday she dumped me. \n\n\nA little background on me just so you understand the job point made later: I'm 24, and recently got out of school. I was in a program that's basically a pre-med program but have since decided to go the PhD route (which was a hard and depressing time for me, big life decision). \n\n\nThe breakup itself went like this. We sat down and I immediately realized what was happening (I had a feeling beforehand, and even brought our scrap book to give back to her). She said she has been feeling sad for a few months and that she can't pinpoint the reason why. But, she did list some reasons in general. She mentioned that she doesn't want to have to tell me things I should already know, such as getting a job (like I mentioned, was in a rut and began looking after her telling me kind of snapped me back into reality), or how she's feeling or communication issues. She mentioned that she thinks we're different people with different perspectives who just don't see the same things the same way. One example of this, which I brought up during, is that she wants to raise her (future) children jewish and I said I'm okay with that. But, she thinks I'm simply going along with it and she doesn't want that. She wants someone who is into it, I told her I would be completely into whatever my family is doing and thus whatever she is doing. Lastly, on thanksgiving I was a bit hungover because the night before I hung out with friends. I get to see my friends together rarely these days, so that's like our yearly party. Bad decision by me, but I didn't think it'd be the end of the world. She said that that event was the event that pushed her from \"I'll work on it\" to \"Let's break up.\"\n\n\nAfter this, realizing I couldn't calm this down to a potential fix, I went to my car and got the scrapbook and gave it to her. We talked a bit more and I pleaded for her to try, that I could show her we're great. She said she can't, but throughout the whole conversation she said multiple times that she loves me. That her loving me made this the difficult decision that it was. So, my question is, if a girl still loves someone but broke up with them for the reasons listed above (which I personally don't see as true, because they're all things that are workable) can the relationship be salvaged down the line?\n\n\n\nTL;DR; MY gf broke up with me, but said she loved me multiple times during the break up.

Anyway, all I remember is that after that day I forced my family to take me back there and and to the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry and many other similar places all the time... By the time I was starting secondary school...this love had been lost.\n\nFast forward to when I was 14, I had a GREAT science teacher who turned a kid who had no confience into a kid with a passion for physcics powerful enough that I would answer every question in class ( big deal for me at the time) and spend my spare hours watching endless documentaries on physics and space, my hatred for maths was gone and became a love so long as I applied it in a physics manner, and I became bloody good at them.\n\nAnyway, he left and we got a new teacher who clearly was just there for the pay, and again my passion simply faded. I got into sixth form doing non-science subjects when I was 16 and a year later left out of a complete disillusionment with education. 2 years later I smoke weed a few times a week and I go to the pub every night, while working at a supermarket and attempting to get into uni via online courses that I hate as I don't feel any passion towards them.\n\nSo for the last few months I have essentially thought that I should either sort my shit out and do SOMETHING with my life, or I should just blow my brains out as there is no point in simply being some arsehole marking time. (My dream of being an astronaut completely forgotten).\n\nSO I come out tonight with my friends and all I am thinking is what the actual hell am I going to do, we sit there talking and (trust me I know this is cheesy) I look up and see orions belt, all the starts, even on a cloudy urban night...and it all comes flooding back. I am 18 years old, on paper I have no background in science and I can only get into uni if I do a foundation year to make sure I have the aptitude for uni....but this doesn't scare me, I know its a series of extreme long shots, but I know what I must do, I sit here now on the precepice of what could be the biggest leap of faith of my life and think...reddit has some resourceful people, why not post there. So I ask for advice, help, guidance.. anything. I understand that I will barely make it into uni, and then I NEED to get top grades in order to become a RAF pilot, which I NEED to be the best at in order to even apply to be a test pilot, which I then would need to not only excel in, but also simply survive...All this in order to get the shot of spending 2 years training for a possible mission that could end in a myriad of ways..

Also this is from my personal experience, I don't think there's any rule to relationships at all but these are things I wish I knew going into it. \n\nSo the story: I'll try to keep it short of course. Me and my ex-boyfriend met when I was 17 and he was 19 and instantly fell head over heels for each other. We were the couple that everyone wanted to be, the one people all agreed would get married after college, the ones that had no issues staying in on a Friday night doing nothing (or coming home at 12AM on a Saturday night to do nothing). We were inseparable and each others' whole lives, as it always is. I was the happiest person in the world when I was with him, and he knew me in ways I didnt even know myself (cliche yet true), its a strange sort of feeling I guess, a feeling of completeness and of just pure happiness. You wake up every day a little bit happier than everyone else and get to go to bed knowing that someone you love with your whole heart loves you too. Its a fantastic feeling, in all honestly. Just to give you perspective as to how much I loved this man; every time I saw him my face would light up and I would gasp, every time something was wrong in his life my day was ruined, every time we fought I felt physical pain and every time I was with him my life was completely surreal. It wasn't just young love, it was something other people caught on to, someone people our age didn't experience yet. I cannot stress that enough.\n\nLike all relationships we had our rocky point, we did at one point break up but we knew we couldnt be happier without the other and therefore always had this impending draw to each other. This time was rough though, we fought a lot and had to talk every day for hours upon hours trying to work at it and figure out our issues. After about a year we were back on track and things were good again. We got back together and things just weren't the same. There were a lot of personality changes, I wasn't the same 17 year old he was definitely not the same 19 year old I had met. We definitely had realized just how much we had grown apart but tried to make it work regardless. Our relationship began to fade, I wasn't as happy as I was, this feeling of safeness and completeness turned to emptiness and doubt. I started noticing so many flaws in him, things I didn't want to notice. The things that used to just bother me now ate me away. Everything was the same but something drastically had shifted, I began to see our relationship in ways that completely contradicted how I felt a year beforehand. \n\nI'll never forget what that last month felt like, here was someone I loved with all my heart, someone I thought would father my children, someone who inspired me and brightened my life...and yet I just knew our relationship was over. I found this quote \"Promise me you will not spend so much time treading water and trying to keep your head above the waves that you forget, truly forget, how much you have always loved to swim.\" Meaning, if you constantly have to work at something you're probably forgetting what it felt like to love it so much in the first place. I realized that this was us, I was the one treading water and I had forgotten how truly happy I used to be in the relationship. I cried myself to sleep every night for a month, he obviously caught on and would ask me questions; why weren't we having sex anymore, why wouldn't I come over anymore, why was I so distant? The truth of the matter is I don't think I could bring myself to look at him without feeling pain. Mind you, I still loved this man so much, SO much. Finally he broke up with me because he knew I didn't have the strength to do it myself. \n\nThe truth is that I couldn't bring myself to break up with him, I didn't want to not be with him, I didn't want to break up but in my mind I didn't want the relationship (which is such a weird feeling might i add). There was a lot of crying on both of our parts, a lot of questioning, a lot of emptiness. Some mornings I would roll over in bed and let myself believe that I'd get to see him, just to get that old feeling of ecstasy back. Some days I hated him, for never buying my flowers, for not making enough effort in our relationship and so many other things. Most days I just wanted to rewind and revisit myself at those happier times.  \n\nSo, I'm 6 months out of the breakup 3 months with consistent no contact(ish) and even though I am still feeling the pain, here are some tips along with some things that you will experience and are TOTALLY normal in a breakup:\n\n1) If you're not having sex anymore there is a serious problem. This is not something to be taken lightly, this is something that almost everyone notices leading up to their breakup. I think a part of it is that you don't feel as connected to the person anymore, you don't feel like allowing yourself to be bare naked in front of them anymore because you're not comfortable allowing yourself to be emotionally bare in front of them anymore. Once you begin to become unhappy in the relationship you really won't want to have sex anymore. This may come in the form of excuses, you may blame it on too much work or being stressed but in retrospect when you haven't had sex in over a month and can't bring yourself to, there's a problem. \n\n2) Every single day will be different. Some days you are going to walk around with your head held high and ask yourself \"why the hell was I ever upset over this relationship to begin with?!\" and some days you'll find yourself in bed on a Friday night at 9:30 watching PS I Love You crying your eyes out, trying to remember what it felt like to be loved that much. This is totally normal and take it day by day, there is no due process in a breakup; every day will be different the first day will feel much different than the second and the second could feel the same as the 365th, it isnt exactly a process its an experience. \n\n3) Regain yourself. One of the most beautiful things in a relationship is that youre not afraid to give a part (or all) of yourself to your SO. Unfortunately, this is part of what makes breakups so different. This person will always have this special part of you, you have given them everything and probably have nothing left to give at this point. The only thing you can do here is regain YOU. For some this is changing your appearance, quitting smoking, getting a new job, for me it was regularly exercising and redoing my room. You don't need to reinvent yourself but do something that makes you feel as though you have full control over. Also, accept that that part of you is gone (or temporarily gone). Right now they have your emotional, optimistic, whole-hearted self and you're probably left with the (500) Days of Summer watching, \"love doesn't exist,\" murmuring self. That's totally normal to feel but try to take possession of yourself again. This will take time (no I have not fully experienced this yet). \n\n4) No contact. This is on every single one of these so I couldn't disregard it. No contact, no contact, no contact. The way you act during your breakup does not in any way represent the relationship you had accurately AT ALL. Holding on to the other person will only hurt you and them more, and will prevent you from envisioning your life without them. We're all scared to let go of the other person, how could someone who was your whole life just turn into nothing overnight? How did you get to this point? Unfortunately the other person cannot help you answer these questions, these are questions you can only answer through self-reflection of the breakup. You're going to want to reach out and you probably will honestly (I've made this mistake), but the truth of the matter is that you're not going to find what you're looking for by talking to the other person. It isn't going to feel the same as it did and neither of you are truly going to know what to say. There's no point in running on fumes in relationships.\n\n5) Remember the good and the bad, but remember it for what it was. So many times people will look back on their relationship wishing they could go back to those happy times where the relationship was good. Of course this skews your perception and distracts you from the fact that at the time breaking up was the right choice. Try to remember the bad too, yes we all know that the highest of the highs are more significant than the lowest of the lows but it is important to remember both. At the same time, dont perceive the person as completely horrible and unforgivable in your head. They probably aren't and you won't have enough anger to cover up your heartbreak for the next 1-5 years (depending on how long it takes).\n\n6) Do not allow yourself to regret anything. This is very hard to do but when you find yourself beginning to guilt yourself remind yourself that regret is pointless. You cannot go back and stop yourself from deciding to date that person, you cannot go back to the night where you shouldn't have said that, you cannot go back and most importantly if you could you can't change the way you felt anyway. When you feel yourself trying to do this remind yourself: never regret anything, because at one point (even if it was just for a millisecond) it was exactly what you wanted. \n*In truth you'll never truly be sure that you made the right decision. It will be very difficult to confidently tell yourself that you were right to end that relationship (if it is a perfectly healthy one, of course) and this is something that most people struggle with. My friends ask me all the time, \"so what are you going to do now without him?\" when i answer \"I dont know\" they always ask me if I'm scared and every time the answer is \"terrified.\" I am absolutely terrified, I havent been single in 3 years, I lost the love of my life but I am learning. In truth breakups are extremely terrifying because they leave a ton of questions you can't answer: did i make the right decision? Where will my life go? Will we ever speak again? How is (s)he doing? Embrace the fact that you can't answer these questions and let that represent all the new possibilities your life has just opened up to. \n\n7) Let yourself feel. This in my opinion is the most productive thing you can do for yourself. Never stop yourself from feeling sad during this time period. You're going to get tired of having flashbacks, you're going to get sick of missing them and you're going to want to force yourself not to feel this way. With emotions I always find that the best way out is through, if you're feeling sad that day let yourself be sad, if you want to reminisce on the happy and can't distract your mind let yourself do it. Its totally normal and better in the long run. There isn't any right way to do a breakup and your emotions are always justifiable so just let yourself feel them and drink them in. If you try to force yourself to feel another way, they'll find their way back in and hurt more. Some days I'll be feeling like I'm over my ex-boyfriend but then when I'm laying to go to sleep my mind will start reconstructing his old room, literally piece by piece (his bed, his desk, etc.). Of course I don't want to do this, its like twisting the knife but the more I try to suppress it the more I prolong it trying to creep its way back into my thoughts. Don't question your emotions, your mind is trying to surface something for a reason and even though you may not understand it its important to let the thought run its course. Let yourself feel, it'll suck but breakups are supposed to suck.\n\n8) DO NOT REBOUND. Your friends will all tell you that you need to distract yourself, get yourself back out there, \"the best way to get over someone is to get under someone new.\" Please don't do this. Going out and flirting is okay, even the occasional random hook up, we all do it because no one wants to be lonely for a night. But most of the the time the first person you're dating right after your breakup will not be the person you're ending up with. You'll start to realize that this person has all the qualities you wish your ex did/didn't have (for example my ex boyfriend was extremely smart and manipulative, the guy I dated after him was as dumb as a brick) but one day you'll realize that they're missing all the things you loved about your ex. You'll compare the two relationships, the two people and this is a huge sign you're not over your last relationship. If your ex is still in your mind most of the time, if you're still thinking about them when you're with the other person then you shouldn't be rebounding at all. It also isn't fair to the other person, dating them just because they aren't your ex. It isn't fair to keep them around just because you're afraid of being lonely. You have to be alone right now, and you have to feel lonely. Covering up your emotions through someone else will only last as long as you keep the other person around. This is just my personal experience but I've spoken to others who do have the same experiences as well. Once you learn to be okay being alone and once you stop craving the love of another person then you have regained yourself and then can start dating again. What left do you have to give to this new person if your ex still has this part of you?\n\n9) Never be afraid to vent, and in venting don't censor your feelings. Everything you are feeling in your breakup is COMPLETELY normal. Seriously, as dramatic and irrational as it seems it is normal. It is normal to think of driving to their house at 3AM to see them, it is normal to want to wish them (or yourself) dead, it is normal to wonder about the future for both of you and chances are someone else has been through this and has felt similar to you have. What I have found is that more or less all breakups are very similar and we all make the same mistakes but don't listen to someone's advice until you've experienced it for yourself (we don't realize not to touch the stove from our parents telling us, we have to burn ourselves first). So, now that you're on the other side of the breakup never hesitate to reach out to someone about it. They have the most enlightening perspectives on it and its good to know that you're not alone in your feelings. Breakups are scary because you probably thought the only person who understood you so well was your SO but that's probably because you only allowed yourself to open up to them. You'll find a fulfilling feeling when you allow others to see your vulnerable side as well. This is extremely important because you'll feel less dependent on your SO. \n\n10) Keep reminding yourself that you're going to be okay. Breakups are the rudest of awakenings and its going to be absolutely horrible but in life there is time and time heals everything. One of my favorite quotes is from \"Wish I Was Here,\" when they say \"on the other side of heartbreak is wisdom.\" Nothing is more true than this so keep breathing, drink in all the emotions you are about to feel and take it day by day. \n\nTLDR: Take care of yourself, take it day by day, don't rebound, don't censor or block your emotions, don't regret anything, you'll never truly be sure you made the right decision but trust your gut. \nObviously feel free to PM me if you need I always love to give advice and hear people out! Hope this helps someone.","media":null,"ups":58,"retrieved_on":1441043837,"created_utc":"1417395621","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"relationships","domain":"self.relationships","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"Everything I [20/F] realized from my breakup with my [22/M] ex-boyfriend from our healthy, 3 year relationship.","secure_media_embed":{}}

So she lives two hours away from me so it will be a lot easier to see her compared to some other long distance relationships.  We both consider each other to be best buds and we have been through a lot together.  This is where i need help :/...so she asked me to move down where she lives to go to college and I really want to and it feels right and I talked to my parents about it and they seem pretty chill with it and such and will support me as well but do you think it is to soon for me to be thinking of moving down with her if we haven't been going out for a month?  I feel like it is a bit different mostly because we were best buds for a while before we dated and we know almost everything about each other so I don't see any wrong in it so I wanted to here other people's thoughts and opinion's on it.

I was five years old (I'm 15 now) when it happened, but I remember this VERY well.\n\nAnyways, I went to Mexico with my cousin (he was about the same age I was) during the summer to visit our family. Around this time there's a fair that goes on in the city we were in. One night we were coming back from the fair (I was with two of my aunts, three of my uncles, my cousin, an my grandma so it big group). We walked home since the fair was like an eight minute walk away from our house. When we got there one of my uncles realized he left the key inside which meant we were locked outside.\n\nThe rest of my family and I were standing across the street (the street has a pretty small length). Across the street there's small park and a water well. There's also a lot of trees and bushes. We were standing near the well which the right side of us.\n\nSo my uncles borrowed a ladder from our neighbor to climb to the roof to open a door that led to our house. Being the kid I was, I had to go to the bathroom and I couldn't hold it. So I told my that I really had to go and she said I can do my business behind a bush. Just as she was about to take me, I see these large green eyes glowing. I was frightened. Now it wasn't like deer eyes because 1.we were in the city where deer don't roam around and 2.these eyes had a different shape and size. They had a shape like this: (http://thumb7.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/1725133/156287855/stock-vector-glowing-eyes-156287855.jpg), but they were green obviously. They had no pupil either. One eye was about 7 centimeters in length and about 5 centimeters in width. It also couldn't have been a guy in a costume because it didn't have a  silhouette.\n\nI quickly told my aunt that I didn't have to go that badly anymore and that I can hold it. We stood outside for about 2 more minutes. During that time I could still see the eyes looking straight at me. For some reason I wasn't scared anymore, rather I felt comforted. It would tilt it's head from side to side as if it was admiring me. I remember smiling at it. When we went inside the house I asked my cousin, \"Hey did you see that?\" He said, \"What?\" I said, \"The thing that was in the bushes. I had big green eyes.\" Then he said, \"What are you talking about?\" After that I was kind of confused, but I just shook it off.\n\nWhen I was 13, I was looking back at that memory and thinking about it. Then it hit me, and when it did I cried with joy. My whole life has been revolved around the color green. If a character from a show/movie was wearing green, that would be my favorite color. If a character had green eyes/hair/skin, that would be my favorite character. If a character's or a celebrity's favorite color was green, I would like that person.  If I was in a group for school, they would be the green team or something related to the color green.\n\nEver since then I felt like something was watching over me, and it doesn't scare me.","id":"2nw7ap","archived":true,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2nw7ap","gilded":0,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":1,"is_self":true,"author":"[deleted]","from":null,"stickied":false,"from_kind":null,"created":1417396001,"subreddit_id":"t5_2t3t8","secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/2nw7ap/green_eyes/","from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":2}

It's not for lack of trying... I do approach guys, ask them on dates, initiate the next moves (or give clear signals), and so on (I avoid coming on really strongly, but I don't force him to do all the work, if that makes sense). But I always end up being the girl who they are happy to have sex with, but then they move on to someone else or just don't look at me as girlfriend material. I'm not sure why and I am so, so afraid of being alone forever. When I was a teenager, I told myself that I'd get a boyfriend in college, now I'm finishing up my education and I've still never heard or said \"I love you\" to someone, or even been able to honestly say, \"I have a boyfriend.\" I've let the younger me down completely. My family asks me every Christmas if I'm dating someone, and I always have to say no. :( They probably think I'm a lesbian or something.\n\nI'm just not sure what I'm doing wrong. I've met guys at parties, at bars, through online dating, through friends, pretty much whichever venue. I'm not 10/10 beautiful but I'm minimum average and have been told I'm pretty. I'm skinny/normal weight, normal height for girls. When I've casually dated guys, I try to be a good potential partner... I make breakfast in the morning, cuddle lots, laugh at his jokes, tell my own anecdotes, ask about his life, share opinions... I'm a decent conversationalist, not amazingly funny but I have my little quips and sort of a sarcastic/dry sense of humor. I'm sympathetic and laid-back, I usually get people to open up to me fairly quickly and take a real interest in their lives and feelings. I even buy little gifts sometimes just because it reminded me of them. I initiate hanging out, and I always look for new things to do together around the city or up north (I pretty much have a going list of cool cultural events I wanna check out, and also enjoy camping, hiking, canoeing, etc. - I'm the friend always bringing people to do something for the first time) but I also enjoying staying home and watching Netflix and playing games (videogames or board games). Point being, usually I have no problem finding common ground of things to do together and have fun. I also party, drink, and smoke in moderation, I don't go as crazy as when I was younger but I'm not uptight about it (pretty much all of my friends/guys I've seen are on the same level as me). I'm not very talented, I admit (I play one instrument as a beginner, speak a few languages but not perfectly, am a bit better at art than the average person but nowhere close to someone who is actually good, and never got into theatre or sports - again, just as a beginner or so many years ago that I've lost it), and I don't have any hardcore level hobbies (like I've mentioned, I spend my free-time mostly doing things I find fun around the city - there's so much! - or spending time with friends). Most of the time I've got school to worry about, since I'm in a difficult program and have a job lined up. So, I guess I enjoy consuming more than creating (but that's most of the population, isn't it?). As for sex, I rarely say no and I initiate sometimes, I have no qualms about giving or receiving head or anything, I've even done a bit of anal. I'm not into any BDSM, fantasies, or fetishes but I'd be open to it (never had a partner who brought that up though). I've never done group sex. Also, in this long post I have to mention what I know my negatives to be. The worst is that people say I'm too negative/pessimist (for example, if I open up about my past, there is some dark history but generally people are sympathetic to it) and I can be a bit in my own world at times that people mistake for being unfriendly (however never with a guy I'm dating - it's just either someone is a close friend, or I don't really notice them much).\n\nAnyway, I feel like I've written a lot, I'm not even sure about what's relevant or not, to be honest. I guess I just feel really exhausted with dating, I'm so tired of being cast aside by guys, and never being good enough. I just hate it, I would love to be \"good enough\" and just have my feelings genuinely reciprocated. If anyone has some insight, or even girls with similar experiences, that'd be lovely. All of my friends have been in love at some point or another and I feel like I'm just sitting there on the backburner, with my cats (I do love cats though). Thanks for the long dull read.

{"selftext":"I am a 22 year old guy in my senior year in college, but to start off the post, I will describe what my life has been like.\n\nI was never a popular guy in my life (I've never had multiple group of friends to hang out with), but I always had 2-3 friends by my side throughout my life. But, because I've moved around my whole life across the state multiple times, those friend never stuck with me.\n\nIn high school, I didn't worry too much about not having friends to hang out with on the weekends. In fact, I spent most of my weekends in my freshman, sophomore, and junior years surfing the web and studying for tests. But, this was during the time when Facebook wasn't popular and I thought it was normal for a student to stay home on the weekends. My focus was mainly on attaining good grades and being accepted into a prestigious university. And after getting my acceptance letter in senior year, I hung out with a group of friends (all guys) more whom I still stay in contact with today. We played basketball, video games, and etc. after school and on the weekends and it was an enjoyable period of life.\n\nIn college, I convinced myself that I was going to make more friends who were girls and become more popular. But, I struggled to adapt in freshman year, both academically and emotionally, and it frustrated me so much. The first semester was fun and I had a group of friends who I hung out with all of the time, but once they faded out of the picture and stopped inviting me to hang out, I didn't have anyone else to resort to. I suffered depression from all the things I had to endure and it was truly the lowest point of my life. I contemplated suicide every day and began to question the purpose of life... How do people with a lot of friends get the best of grades in classes? I had neither and I felt like garbage for 6 months.\n\nDepression eventually went away after taking a year of break from school and I went back to college with renewed purpose. I wanted to be more proactive and outgoing and it worked a little better in the beginning, but at the end of the day, I was back to the starting point I was always in. I tried joining a fraternity and other clubs, but I didn't make a single friend... Whenever I tried to be friends with them, I was rejected and I never tried again. The same happened in my junior year and now that I'm in my senior year and I'm 22, I've been looking back at my life and thinking about all the things I could have done differently. I feel like I should have been even more proactive; however, now I think it's too late. I am 22 without friends or a girlfriend or a job or confidence and no matter how optimistic I try to be, I feel hopeless every other day... Recently, I've been feeling more down than ever because I didn't get a single interview for all the job applications I submitted (I want to enter finance and all the bulge bracket companies have been recruiting candidates for the past month), rejected by a girl I bonded with, and the sheer fact that I don't have any friends I connect with... \n\nDoes life get better?

I am 26. So me and my girlfriend(now ex) were dating for almost 5 years, we have been through a lot and there for each other every time. But recently after a weird conversation we had about how my mental health has been inhibiting my growth she decided she didn\u2019t want to be with me anymore. \n\nI have had many issues with my self-image and being stuck in a rut of not doing much because I feel that I have trouble with showing my true self. She always said I seemed to try to impress people which I understand I definitely always tried to make myself appear cooler for no reason and I would always hate how I did it as well.\n\n Since the break-up on 10/7/2014 we have been talking almost once a week but really long conversations and everything. She said she needs this and wasn\u2019t in the hunt for other partners but this doesn\u2019t mean she wouldn\u2019t date someone else. \n\nWe have a lot of mutual friends and they say that she seems to seem care about me but I don\u2019t know in what sense (like maybe getting back together or just as a friend). I find it very hard not to talk to her. Though I know I need to work on myself which I have been doing. I am in school and living with my parents currently trying to move out to a city which is closer to her but am not moving there for her, I am a electrical engineering major with only 8 class left so I moved for better career opportunities. \n\nShe has been telling me that I need to work on these things and get active which I started doing by working out and mediating to get to a deeper meaning on why I have trouble with self-esteem and things. I have sent her emails telling her how I feel and that I still love her and have been focusing on improving my life not just for her but so I can be a better person regardless. \n\nShe returns with nice messages but insist that she doesn\u2019t have an idea if we will get back together because she wants me to be myself and not do things for anyone else. Its not that I always do that I just have trouble saying no to people when it comes to going out and not including or thinking of her first. I was just wondering if anyone could help me. I don\u2019t know if I should stop talking to her because I do get a lot of advice from her and it might seem that I can\u2019t do things on my own. But she is such a great listener and helps me with problems I have and I couldn\u2019t image her not being in my life.\n\n I think she might need time to realize she misses me more (she says she doesn\u2019t want to see me in person quite yet because it might make her jump the gun and get back together with me for the wrong reasons and not be fully committed to us which is completely understandable).\n\n I have never been good at reading people and understanding things as they are. \n\n\nSorry I am not a great writer hope you can follow this ok. I just want some insight on how to handle the whole me contacting her when she doesn\u2019t contact me, but will talk to me for a while if I start to talk to her? Please help I felt the worst in my life when we parted ways. Its hard to focus on myself when I really want her in my life.\n\nUPDATE: How should I respond if she contacts me. Since the holidays are coming up i feel she will get in touch and I am unsure how to go about handling that.\n\ntl:dr I need help on what to do, I  want her to know im  working on growing, but I dont want to smother her by getting advice and letting her know what Ive been doing all the time.","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/askwomenadvice/comments/2nw9y3/i_26mneed_help_with_giving_my_ex25f_time/"}

Since the beginning of our relationship, we've lived a very traditional sort-of relationship, with him being the man of the house, taking care of all the matters and responsibility, and I'm helping him out, giving ideas, supporting him, while working for my Master's degree. We both really like this lifestyle. I've never felt more comfortable and safe in my life.\n\nHe's a really assertive man, caring, understanding, loving. Due to our everyday lifestyle and our sexual preferences, he's definitely grown even stronger in all these aspects. The problem is this -\n\nMy mother is a very observant person and we've always had a close relationship. Lately, she's been telling me that in her opinion he is \"pushing\" me, or \"silencing\" me. She said, that he'd just slightly press my hand and I'd stop talking. I said, that it happened only once when we were at a family reunion and I started talking about some things that could potentially start some arguments (politics). I actually was kind of glad that he stopped me then..\n\nShe admits that he's really trying hard to make my life better, to help me, to take care of me and that he's kind of overprotective. She said, that as a person, my SO really reminds my dad - a guy with a pretty stubborn and difficult character, but with an extremely loving heart. And she warned me, that as time passes, it can become harder to regain my independence, if I don't fight back against him. He might start making decisions and leave me out of it. It's weird to hear about it because I'm never the silent type and I always argue against all injustice. \n\nNow I'm in a really big dilemma. I love our lifestyle, I'm really happy and I don't want it to stop. I like him being confident, a strong and trustable shoulder I can lean against. In a way I understand her concern, but also - I've never experienced him saying \"You've got to do this/ You must not because you're a woman\" or whatever of this like. Au contraire. He absolutely supports me in everything I do. All of the choices I make are mine, and haven't been affected by his opinion. Me, being a bit subservient to him, it's the dynamic of our relationship. Should I start changing it because it doesn't seem perfect for her? Or should we simply tone it down (although we're not actually doing *anything* regarding our dynamic when we're at my parents..)? I'm confused. She made me feel like as if I'm living with some kind of a predator, or the guy from the movie \"Sleeping with the enemy\". \n","retrieved_on":1441043743,"ups":13,"subreddit":"BDSMcommunity","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1417399794","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.BDSMcommunity","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Mother is concerned about my (22,F) dynamic with my long-term SO (23,M) and Dom.","from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r9tk","created":1417399794,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMcommunity/comments/2nwdvg/mother_is_concerned_about_my_22f_dynamic_with_my/","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":13,"over_18":true,"saved":false,"num_comments":18,"author_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"id":"2nwdvg","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2nwdvg","author":"melissa_t","from":null,"is_self":true}

{"retrieved_on":1441043735,"ups":1,"media":null,"selftext":"First of all, sorry for the ambiguous title, I can't really wrap all that I'm trying to ask in one single meaningful sentence.\n\nSecond, I'm talking about an electric guitar.\n\nThird, I'm 100% sure that these questions were answered a billion times on the internet, it's just the fact that I've never had anything to do with music doesn't really help with producing those questions in a manner that can be answered by googling for a couple of minutes.\n\nSo, the point is, I want to try an electric guitar. I'm 20yo, I've never played anything in my life, I have little to no idea how it all even works, but I'm willing to try. The problem is, I can't be sure that this is something I can do. Therefore, I'm not going to let myself spend any significant amount on a hobby that could die in a couple of days due to my natural incompatibility with art, in a form of music in this case.\n\nAh, almost forgot, the questions (in no particular order... with very little sense frankly):\n\n1. Should I even try an electric guitar? What's the difference from the acoustic guitar? No, not in terms of ease or learning curve, and yes, I know the technical difference, but which one is more... meaningful to learn? I once knew a guy who played bass, to me it seems like he was slamming strings in random order producing deep sounds that could accompany any music. I highly doubt that learning bass gave him any kind of universal knowledge. And, well, I have the same feeling about the electric guitar. It seems more random and less... delicate than acoustic, the latter being something more close to other instruments. I realize that all this may sound like I'm schizophrenic, but this matter really bugs me.\n\n2. Are dirt-cheap guitars any good? I'm absolutely sure that I'll never be any picky in terms of sound quality, but is it possible that a crappy guitar will make a learning curve steeper, like... uhm... be an obstruction for learning, producing wrong sounds and stuff, making a beginner feel like its his own fault? Does Ashtone ST-100 ($100 in my area) at least resemble a proper guitar?\n\n3. Amps are fucking expensive. Excuse me, but at the price range I'm looking at it's like at least 50% of the guitar's price. Ludicrous. I have an ASUS Xonar D1 with a Line-In jack, is it possible for me to just use my PC as an amplifier? Would the sound be clear and enjoyable, or my ears will instantly bleed and I will have to smash the guitar to bits to put an end to my agony? Besides, I've heard stuff about Rocksmith 2014, it would be pretty cool to dodge expenses on an amplifier AND get some kind of a learning program.\n\nI'm truly sorry if the text above made you suspect that you're reading an essay from the mental hospital. I'm totally sane, I just never had to do anything with music and art in general. I'm more of a math person, like calculating numbers, like making computers do what I want using an artificial language that looks pointless from the first glance.

Even I was against it even when I was young. I live in the south so it's not a surprise. Anyways it wasn't until I was 14 (I'm 16 now) when I started really worrying about being gay. I used to think I was attracted to girls because I thought it was normal, but when I discovered guys that was pretty much over. So I really struggled with coming to the fact that I find guys attractive. After a while I just started to grow further and further away from the conservative views I grew up on. I started to not think certain things were weird that were weird to everyone else. Such as men wearing makup, body modification, and things like that. So that's when I started to rebel. At first I thought maybe God had called me to stand up against unnecceptance in the christian community. But then came the whole gay thing. I pretty much accepted that I was attracted to men, because there's no point in me telling my self \"I'm not gay\" dozens of times in my head again. I found out that I couldn't change it, and living a lie doesn't seem like a life I want to live. I'm still closeted.\n\nSo anyways this is how I feel now that I'm no longer a christian. I don't get how God would let someone who I thought to be very close to him (my preacher, even my family) preach against people like me. I'm in a small church so you get to know the pastor more than if you were in a large church. I think he's a good man. I've known him to be very close to god. But I don't get how god wouldn't get on to him about it. Isn't he the same god you guys follow? So anyways I found out for myself that god is man's creation, and I have been leaning on a more atheistic view of the world.\n\nI feel really lonely in the way I feel. I don't go to school, I don't have friends, and I'm really anti-social. I wish there were someone I could relate to. I doubt anyone in my youth group is lgbt, and if they are I feel bad for them because they're all younger and they were probably like me.\n\nIf you actually read this, thank you.

I want the cause to be *anything* but kratom, this leaf that's un-broken my body daily for years. Dominant dymptoms of my illness come and go--headaches ruined 2 years of my life, then neck pain, then brain fog and physical weakness stole a few years. Now, along with the normal fatigue and body pain, nausea and vomiting is my most unwelcome guest. Reading through this sub is waking me up to the strong chance that my kratom use [about 20g twice a day, sometime three times, sometimes more] is causing this pronounced and severe suffering despite its powerful analgesia.\n\nMy reaction is to stop--taper rather that cold turkey--but I also take a delicate constellation of prescribed meds that confuse the situation. Could krat be interacting with one of more of them? Will kicking krat be made worse by taking any of these meds? Am I trying to make a complicated excuse to do anything but stop taking kratom? All of this GI distress is common among patients with my chronic symptoms, so I could be merely experiencing a new phase of the illness. Or I could be poinsoning myself with green powder.\n\n**I have no prior experience with addiction, so if this is it then I need to learn what voices within myself to distrust.** \n\nOr am I overreacting? Can I salvage this situation by switching to kratom tea or tapering to smaller doses instead of bidding this herb a final goodbye? Which line of questioning sounds the most fruitful?\n\nHere are the meds I take every day:\n\n- Dextroamphetmine (60mg)\n\n- Cymbalta (60mg)\n\n- Topamax (100mg)\n \n- Trazodone (100mg)\n\n- Diazepam (15mg)\n\n- Omeprazole\n\n- Hydroxyzone (50mg up to 3x daily as needed)\n\n- Skelaxin (1,600mg up to 2x daily as needed)\n\n- Tylenol (as needed)\n\n- Several refrigerated probiotics\n\n- Marijuana smoked most days\n\n- Nicotine every day\n\n\nI'm scared that my med regimen will make tapering off kratom a much worse experience. Please share any insight you have. I feel scared and stupid and guilty, but most of all I feel too sick to leave the house and this has to stop. \n\nThank you.","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.quittingkratom","subreddit":"quittingkratom","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1417400816","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Tried many meds for painful chronic illness, and kratom has been a godsend. 2 years in and I'm starting to feel a lot worse.

I've been down for a couple of months now, got fired from both of my part-time jobs for symptoms of hypersomnia, and am pretty much numbing out reality. \n\n\n\n\nSome personal history: I've been on anti-depressants since I was 12 years old, when I was diagnosed with depression. I'm 30. I have been taking Wellbutrin since I was 13 and have been taking Effexor XR for several years now. At this point, I'm pretty sure this combination isn't working for me anymore and hasn't for a long time. I've just been in denial, stemmed from fear of side-effects and negative mental responses to other medications. \n\n\n\n\nI manage to be stable...able to function and take care of myself on a day-to-day basis...for several months, and then I hit a low point. Usually during the winter (presumably by SAD), but this time I started coming down in September. While I manage to maintain daily life in my \"high points,\" there is still a part of me that is in total denial about my unhappiness. I convince myself that I'm okay...and for the most part, I am...but something keeps stopping me from growing, challenging myself, and pursuing interests, career opportunities, CHANGE.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway...for the most part, I realize this is mostly personal. But there is also a huge part of me that is annoyed by the fact that I have no idea who I am when I am not on medication. I'm 30 years old. I have been on medication most of my life. \n\n\n\n\nI have mentioned this to my psychiatrist and my therapist and, of course, both expressed concern in me not being on medication--seeing as how I'm not doing so hot right now. But could that be caused by the medication? Or is it because the medication isn't working and this is what it would be like if I was off medication? Or is it because I just need new medication? Or would things be better if I wasn't on medication? I HAVE NO FREAKING CLUE! I have been interested in getting off medication for several years now. And I know I must do this with my psychiatrist's help. Right now, I feel, is an opportune moment as I am not employed and I'm basically going to have to get medication from Patient Assistance Programs. \n\n\n\n\nAny advice is appreciated! I'm so frustrated at this point and have no idea which way to go. I'm tired of this lingering mess and circle I seem to be trapped in...banging my head against every single wall.\n\n\n\n\nThanks! :)","media":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1441043721,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/depression/comments/2nwfkv/question_about_medication/","from":null,"author":"heygoose","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":2,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"name":"t3_2nwfkv","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"id":"2nwfkv","archived":true,"edited":false,"score":1,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qqqf","from_kind":null,"created":1417400822,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2nwfkv/question_about_medication/","stickied":false}

While I know the ultimate responsibility falls on me, my attention was only drawn to the missed payment after the card was rejected. This card is with Chase Canada. I should mention that I have never ever missed any form of payment and always pay in full. In my city we have central \"superboxes\" for mail not door to door service and things get misplaced often. Card is new, and I paid the one previous statement I received in full.\n\nI immediately called the number on the back of the card Friday night - which went to a machine as it was outside business hours (what kind of CC doesn't have 24/7 service?). The girl on the other end was quite rude. at some point:\n\n\nMe: I didn't receive any kind of notice before I was cut off.  \nHer: Well the statement was sent in the mail.  \nMe: We have superboxes etc. but I always pay in full. Did you report this to the credit agencies?  \nHer: Well the credit agencies ask us whether you have paid and we are obligated to reply? (commentary: what kind of nonsense is this?)  \nMe: So did you report the missed payment to them.  \nHer: I can't tell you that sir.  \nMe: Sure you can, I once had a similar situation on another card where my bank misapplied a payment - they immediately told me they hadn't reported it to credit agencies - have you reported it?  \nHer: Yes we have  \nMe: That's a bit upsetting. Listen, I don't care about the interest charges but I was hoping for a credit report delete.  \nHer: I'm not sure why you would want to contest a legitimate charge. (Commentary: So she's not sure why I would not a negative report on my score... genius). You will have to speak to a supervisor  \n/////HOLD........  \nHer: It is the weekend there is no supervisor. If you insist on speaking to one (insist?) you will have to call back Monday.  \nMe: I am out of the country right now, will I do any more damage by waiting to pay on Monday when I return to the country?  \nHer: I'm not sure what you mean by that.  \nMe: Never-mind. Can you unlock the card I need to pay for bags to the airline, and I think I deserved a heads up before it was locked.  \nHer: Only a supervisor can do that  \nMe: So if I'm stranded and get locked out on a weekend in a foreign country I have to wait for a Monday?  \nHer: That is correct.  \nMe: My other card offers me a much higher level of service, I may have to consider paying it off and closing the account.  \nHer: I respect your decision. Anything else I can help you with today?  \nMe: A lot but I have a feeling it won't be worth it today goodbye.  \n\nI got off the phone and had my sister go pay the bill at a Canadian branch  immediately.\n\nTL;DR: Didn't get CC statement in mail, relatively new card, 30 days overdue, CC Co. did not call, locked me out, reported to credit agencies. Paid immediately\n\n\nNow for my questions: I am 28 and I will be looking for a mortgage soon. Don't really want the negative effect on credit score. Will this affect me? Can I get anywhere? Is it worth it?

I'll try my best but it will be pretty spastic because I can't write for shit.  It covers 12ish years so I'll just give the highlights as not to bore anyone.\n\nThis summer my father ended his marriage with my step-mother of ten years.  He cheated on her, and I completely support what he did.  I don't care what people say to me about it, because they don't know the true story.\n\nMy parents divorced when I was about 7 and my little sister was 5.  The divorce wasn't really hard on us because my parents sat us down and explained exactly what was going on - they didn't like each other like they had in the past, but they still loved us, etc.  The next year my dad started dating this woman who I didn't meet until after they had married.  I was only 7/8 but I knew from the first moment I saw her that I would end up hating her.  She was very religious but extremely hypocritical, which bothered me even then.  She started preventing my dad from getting to see us - making errands for him or making him go on trips during the weekends he was supposed to have us.  We basically only saw him for 3 hours a week for 4 years until he finally put his foot down.  When we did see him, he always acted very strange, like he was depressed, and would keep us past 8:00 when we were supposed to be home.  I figure this was because he wanted to spend as long as possible away from her.  I learned later she blackmailed him into staying in the marriage.\n\nShe basically did lots of shitty, emotionally abusive stuff to me, my sister and my dad for years that I don't really like to talk about that still bothers me to this day (I'm 20 now).  \n\nShe is a relatively big public figure in our town so most people know her, but they see her as she presents herself to the public - a good, Christian woman who accepted her husband's children has her own (bullshit, of course).  \n\nThis summer was the end of everything.  I checked my facebook during a break at work and saw a status she had posted on her VERY public page.  She basically said that after ten years of being the model wife and step-mother, she caught her horrid husband cheating on her with another woman and was leaving him.  My first reaction when I read this was joy.  I knew my dad's living hell was over.  He got out the only way he could, even if it meant having people learn about his infidelity.  People commented, apologizing for how horrible he was and how his daughters must be 'ashamed.'\n\nLater that day, my dad basically broke down in front of me and my sister, telling us how he was glad to finally be done with her, and that he could never give us those lost times back.  I never blamed him for any of that because I know how she was.\n\nI've always heard that people who cheat are the worst kinds of people, but honestly, after my experience, I don't think that it is always true.  My dad is a strong guy who I admire more than anyone, and the way she could emotionally cripple him was disturbing to see.  I believe that his affair was the only way he could get out and completely sever all ties, and I don't hate him for it.\n\nMy dad has been with his girlfriend for a few months now.  I haven't seen him this happy since he was with my mother 15 years ago.  I met her on Thanksgiving, and she treats him and my sister and I with respect, and welcomed us into her life.  She called me by my name, asked me questions about myself, and shared funny stories about her life.  In ten years, my ex-step-mother did none of these things.  We were just leftovers from my dad's past life.\n\nToday, on my birthday, she texted me to tell me happy birthday and that she 'still loves' me.  She has never done this before, never given me a birthday card or acknowledged I was an actual person with feelings.  I am angry at her for this, because I know she is seeking sympathy.  I am the last person on earth who would ever feel sorry for her, so I don't really know how to respond, or if i even should.\n\nSorry for the rant, I'm pretty messed up over this right now.","media":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1441043705,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/offmychest/comments/2nwgvq/im_a_terrible_person_and_i_really_dont_care/","from":null,"author":"[deleted]","is_self":true,"num_comments":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_2nwgvq","link_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"id":"2nwgvq","score":1,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"created":1417401560,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2nwgvq/im_a_terrible_person_and_i_really_dont_care/","secure_media":null,"stickied":false}

When I was 15-16 I weighed over 110kg's. When I turned 17 I hit the gym after school, it was a routine with my best friend and lost a lot of weight. I was down to 80-85. Last year I stopped going to the gym because I graduated, I couldn't go with my buddy anymore and the motivation was gone.\n\nI was inactive for a year and gained a lot of my weight back. I also started my own business so no sleep, junk food and energy drinks are killing me again. Few months ago I got a gym membership but I absolutely hate going there. I'm alone, I can't make friends because my schedule is so weird and the bike ride is 20 minutes which is demotivating. (I know, it's cardio).\n\nMy business is doing well and I earned some money. I'm considering clearing out a room in the house and making a home gym. \n\nI was wondering what your thoughts are on this and what the essentials are? I already changed my diet, I just need to get in shape again. I was thinking of getting a set of dumbbels, a fitness mat, an abs trainer (the thing where you lay down and it looks like a cage) and either a home trainer (bike) or a cross trainer (the heavy walking/running machine). Will probably hang a tv there and just go to town whilst watching a movie. I know I'm going to be more dedicated when I can do it at home and whenever I want. \n\nWhat essentials did I miss and what do you think of my plan? Also, should I get the hometrainer or the crosstrainer?\n\nI'm from Belgium so running outside when it's freezing isn't really fun. A home gym would be great fun :-)\n\n\nThanks!
