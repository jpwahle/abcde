{"created_utc":1383347997,"selftext":"So I've been here ~~stalking~~lurking for a while and I dont know why I didnt get reminded of this earlier, I apologise that this is long.\n\nHere's a little background first, I'm really into gaming, I have a steam account, I have an xbox 360, a PS3, origin account, ds's and whatever, this all happened when I was 15-17, I met my boyfriend of the time through xbox (his name was Sam and he was 10months younger than me), we'd been together 8ish months and I was now 16 when we started having some issues, fairly normal stuff, both stressing about exams and whatnot, our other 'friend' was an asshole constantly putting Sam down and trying to impress me so he was having a blast that we were having problems which put more strain on us. Anyway, the story.\n\nLike I said we'd been having problems, I use the same name (or variations on it) for pretty much all my accounts on everything, skype, steam, xbox, twitter and whatever and because of this I often get random adds from say, an xbox friend looked me up on steam when I mentioned I had an account, which I'm cool with, I have some awesome friends. Skype on the other hand I get random adds from some pretty creepy people looking for domsex and pics (because hey I like the alias Miss Torture so I refuse to change it and I'm pretty friendly so I accept all adds, deleting any creeps and keeping any who are just looking for a chat, I've made some cool friends through doing this)\n\nAiden added me on skype around the time me and Sam were having issues, he was kinda creepy and would flirt, but also talked about his single-mother-girlfriend-with-two-kids so I just kinda ignored it and used him to vent my problems with my relationship and we'd just generally chat, bear in mind I'm 16 and hes 26+ and would often make weird remarks and ask vulgar questions (which I would ignore), he then found me on steam and I guess accepting his request gave him some kinda confirmation him on a little because he got weirder but again I ignored it, me and Sam broke up and got back together and whatever else happened and our asshole friend was kinda concerned about me talking with Aiden as any friend would even if he was a jerk, as was Sam and I was getting really weirded out by him so one day I just blocked and deleted him off both Skype and Steam and thought that was the end of it.\n\nFast forward a couple months, me and Sam had broken up, I'd been manipulated into a relationship with the asshole friend and I'd broken up with him after a month, I was pretty much alone, all my old friends were gone, Sam and his best friend had left our group when me and Sam split up, the asshole and his best friend left when I broke up with him because \"You're a bitch I've never been mean to you\" and the rest of our group drifted apart and suddenly Aiden appeared again.\n\nHe got his friend to add me on steam to talk to me and ask to re-add him, I was concerned about this cuz it seemed really weird that he'd do this out of the blue but I gave him the benefit of the doubt and re added him. (I was now almost 17). He started out ok but still with all the creepy flirts, he suddenly 180'd and asked how I was doing with Sam, I gave him the brief overview that we werent together anymore and he started going on about a weird story that he (Aiden) was actually an undercover cop and that Sam had been some 40yr old perv trying to get me to meet with him, he said he had \"Sams file\" right there and that I needed to be careful, I of course went straight to Sam, pasting the conversation as it was happening because me and Sam had often webcammed and would always be chatting over mic and whatever else (his voice cracked often as most teenage guys voices do and it was in general fairly obvious that he was not lying about his age) I was understandably getting very upset that Aiden was saying all these things about my ex as we were still fairly neutral friends.\n\nAiden was going on about this for a while, making up \"big words\" so that he'd sound official and smart, I am in no way dumb and know these words were completely made up, even going as far as to google definitions if I was unsure and coming up blank each time because of it was an invalid word, I eventually told him to fuck off and leave me alone and blocked and deleted him, the friend he had told to add me sent me one last message from aiden before I deleted him also, saying something along the lines of insulting me, saying he looked at my profile most days since I deleted him that previous year and saying it doesnt matter that I deleted/blocked him because he had multiple other accounts, some of which I was unknowingly friends with and spoke to often (which I know isnt true because at the time I didnt really talk to anyone on Steam)\n\nI dont know, it was really creepy at the time, the fact I was a minor and he was at least 10 years older was weird, all the gross flirting he tried to pull while on the other hand mentioning his gf was all so strange to me, a confused, upset, lonely girl who felt like the world was against her and just wanted a friend. I think I still have the chat log from the day he claimed to be an undercover cop or whatever it was if you guys are interested, but yeah, theres my story, I may have gotten a little of the background continuity wrong but it doesnt really matter.\n\nI've now turned 18 and recently discovered I have a friend in common with Aiden on Steam, they met through some obscure tf2 map, and though I've told the friend about all this he refuses to remove him because \"Aiden is funny\", though I have him blocked I am concerned for my friend, the likelyhood is he will be fine though, hes a 6ft+,21yr old, built like a wall mexican guy and Aiden is some guy who thinks hes the shit but hes just a small fish in one huge ass pond\n\nHope you enjoyed the story, I apologise again for the length, have a good day :)","is_self":true,"link_flair_css_class":null,"media":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":17,"author_flair_text":null,"banned_by":null,"link_flair_text":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1ppxhb/skype_and_steam_stalker/","title":"Skype and Steam Stalker","subreddit_id":"t5_2t3t8","author":"Miss_Torture","stickied":false,"subreddit":"LetsNotMeet","secure_media_embed":{},"media_embed":{},"gilded":0,"num_comments":11,"user_reports":[],"id":"1ppxhb","over_18":false,"permalink":"/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1ppxhb/skype_and_steam_stalker/","score":17,"domain":"self.LetsNotMeet","retrieved_on":1411643124,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been here &lt;del&gt;stalking&lt;/del&gt;lurking for a while and I dont know why I didnt get reminded of this earlier, I apologise that this is long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a little background first, I&amp;#39;m really into gaming, I have a steam account, I have an xbox 360, a PS3, origin account, ds&amp;#39;s and whatever, this all happened when I was 15-17, I met my boyfriend of the time through xbox (his name was Sam and he was 10months younger than me), we&amp;#39;d been together 8ish months and I was now 16 when we started having some issues, fairly normal stuff, both stressing about exams and whatnot, our other &amp;#39;friend&amp;#39; was an asshole constantly putting Sam down and trying to impress me so he was having a blast that we were having problems which put more strain on us.

He's a bit older than me (32) and most of his friends are married and have children or are trying to have kids.\n\nBefore we started dating, I knew I wanted kids and to get wifed yadda yadda, but since I've been SURROUNDED by babies and families I feel like I'm almost in pain because I don't have any children of my own. It doesn't help that my own friends have started having kids as well. \n\nI don't know what to do. It's making me incredibly depressed and I long for my own family. I babysit for my friends, family, and grew up taking care of my younger brothers so I am definitely more than capable of taking care of my own child BUT I also am not in a place in my relationship where this could be possible. I know I would have all the support in the world from my family and his if anything ever happened (it wont because I'm on Depo), but he also isn't in a place where he could handle children. It just hurts. I love kids and I can assure that my reasons for wanting children are not entirely selfish. As someone who has taken care of many kids, I know it's not a smooth sail, but that's just something you sacrifice for something better.\n\nI'm not sure what I'm looking for here, but I guess as a young woman I'd like to know if I'm alone in feeling this? Is it bad? How would someone cope with these feelings?

He&amp;#39;s got two sons who are both 28 (twins). My Mom and I were always really close, especially right after the divorce.

{"created_utc":1383342833,"selftext":"Hey Seddit, the title lays down the groundwork, I'll try and keep this is as simple as possible.\n\nA little background info: I am 17, I work with a very good looking 9/10 girl one day a week at a local restaurant. I'll call her J. We've known each other for about three months, each day getting to know each other better and better., each day hitting it off more and more etc.\n\nI have NEVER been more recklessly confident with a girl out of my league before. Our sense of humour is almost identical - thank god - and I know for a fact she's into me.\n\nShe's 20, here in Canada the drinking age is 19, so obviously she's legal. Tonight, in T-minus 8 hours, she's going to a pub with two other girls and I'm invited. (It'll be easy to sneak me in, apparently).\n\nNow I wouldn't hesitate to say I think she wants a relationship with me. I wouldn't hesitate to say there's a chance of me falling into her infamous \"best-friend zone\". I know I'm not in it yet from her friends, but I know time is going to run out - that's why I want to make the first move tonight.\n\nHere's the problem. I'm inexperienced to the TEE. I've been to about 3 parties I can count on my fingers, I've made out twice in my life with two different girls. That is literally it. And despite the fact I'm confident, I know for a fact I'll be walking into the pub tonight and J will be hammered, J will be in a completely different state - she will be the life of the party, she'll be talking to everyone - and I just won't know what the fuck to do. A ton of people will be there, even her older, male \"bestfriends\".\n\nI'm confident, I think at the very least I'm going to try and take her to a corner of the pub at the end of the night and go for a kiss. Anything could happen though, despite how confident I am around her, MAN am I inexperienced. Fake it till you make it, I know - but before going tonight I thought, hey why not spend half an hour typing this out for Seddit.\n\nI appreciate any advice making this learning experience for me into that much more of a (hopeful) success - thanks.\n*******************************************************************************\nOK so here's the update,\nwe didn't hook up - I'm still disappointed, but it was a VERY Fun night.\nThe predrink was probably the best part. If I could, I should have taken weedntaichai/ lameno's advice and maybe gone for the kiss when we were alone there, instead of waiting for the pub. At first J didn't seem too interested in, but as the predrink was ending we were holding hands and doing some basic kino stuff, etc. \nNow, this whole time she's got one of her \"best friends\" literally wrapped around her, and despite the fact she's giving me (but not him) all the signs she's not into him, this best friend literally won't stray away from her.\nOK, so cab to the pub. I'm drunk, I don't get in. I make two attempts, actually get in the second time but am shortly kicked out. I wasn't too bummed. There were three bouncers outside and I got to know them fairly well. Matt, Hamen, Alex, and Nate. We literally talked for over 45 minutes, by the end of it they were offering me cigarettes I didn't take and telling me HOW to game J (grow a beard, hit the gym...) \nNeedless to say I waited for J to come out, she and the rest of the crew weren't staying in the pub long. I pulled her hand to the side of the pub where no one could see us too well (there was a group of her friends who could see us) We were close, but we didn't kiss. Not because I didn't go for it, I sort of did, but because she didn't seem like she wanted to then. I was actually shocked, my heart sank. The exact memory is foggy.

I&amp;#39;ll call her J. We&amp;#39;ve known each other for about three months, each day getting to know each other better and better., each day hitting it off more and more etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have NEVER been more recklessly confident with a girl out of my league before. Our sense of humour is almost identical - thank god - and I know for a fact she&amp;#39;s into me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s 20, here in Canada the drinking age is 19, so obviously she&amp;#39;s legal. Tonight, in T-minus 8 hours, she&amp;#39;s going to a pub with two other girls and I&amp;#39;m invited. (It&amp;#39;ll be easy to sneak me in, apparently).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I wouldn&amp;#39;t hesitate to say I think she wants a relationship with me. I wouldn&amp;#39;t hesitate to say there&amp;#39;s a chance of me falling into her infamous &amp;quot;best-friend zone&amp;quot;. I know I&amp;#39;m not in it yet from her friends, but I know time is going to run out - that&amp;#39;s why I want to make the first move tonight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the problem. I&amp;#39;m inexperienced to the TEE. I&amp;#39;ve been to about 3 parties I can count on my fingers, I&amp;#39;ve made out twice in my life with two different girls. That is literally it. And despite the fact I&amp;#39;m confident, I know for a fact I&amp;#39;ll be walking into the pub tonight and J will be hammered, J will be in a completely different state - she will be the life of the party, she&amp;#39;ll be talking to everyone - and I just won&amp;#39;t know what the fuck to do. A ton of people will be there, even her older, male &amp;quot;bestfriends&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m confident, I think at the very least I&amp;#39;m going to try and take her to a corner of the pub at the end of the night and go for a kiss. Anything could happen though, despite how confident I am around her, MAN am I inexperienced. Fake it till you make it, I know - but before going tonight I thought, hey why not spend half an hour typing this out for Seddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appreciate any advice making this learning experience for me into that much more of a (hopeful) success - thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OK so here&amp;#39;s the update,\nwe didn&amp;#39;t hook up - I&amp;#39;m still disappointed, but it was a VERY Fun night.\nThe predrink was probably the best part. If I could, I should have taken weedntaichai/ lameno&amp;#39;s advice and maybe gone for the kiss when we were alone there, instead of waiting for the pub. At first J didn&amp;#39;t seem too interested in, but as the predrink was ending we were holding hands and doing some basic kino stuff, etc. \nNow, this whole time she&amp;#39;s got one of her &amp;quot;best friends&amp;quot; literally wrapped around her, and despite the fact she&amp;#39;s giving me (but not him) all the signs she&amp;#39;s not into him, this best friend literally won&amp;#39;t stray away from her.\nOK, so cab to the pub. I&amp;#39;m drunk, I don&amp;#39;t get in. I make two attempts, actually get in the second time but am shortly kicked out. I wasn&amp;#39;t too bummed. There were three bouncers outside and I got to know them fairly well. Matt, Hamen, Alex, and Nate. We literally talked for over 45 minutes, by the end of it they were offering me cigarettes I didn&amp;#39;t take and telling me HOW to game J (grow a beard, hit the gym...) \nNeedless to say I waited for J to come out, she and the rest of the crew weren&amp;#39;t staying in the pub long. I pulled her hand to the side of the pub where no one could see us too well (there was a group of her friends who could see us) We were close, but we didn&amp;#39;t kiss. Not because I didn&amp;#39;t go for it, I sort of did, but because she didn&amp;#39;t seem like she wanted to then. I was actually shocked, my heart sank. The exact memory is foggy. After that she cabbed back with a few friends to her area of town and I did the same, shaking the bouncers&amp;#39; hands before I left. I&amp;#39;ve still got a text from her asking &amp;quot;U ok?&amp;quot; which I haven&amp;#39;t responded to yet.\nI work with J on Sunday, and I don&amp;#39;t know what the fuck to do or say.\nThanks guys &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is turning into an essay, but I might aswell ask one more quick question if you have the time.\nThis is VERY secondary.\nI have two tickets to see a Arctic Monkeys concert in a month that I was going to ask J to. \nShe KNOWS the 2nd ticket is free, we&amp;#39;re always teasing back and forth that she doesn&amp;#39;t know the band but that I need someone to go with. \nI was actually planning on just handing her a USB stick one day after work, for her to go home and find the music all on it.

I try to focus on not *touching* my skin instead of not picking my skin.  I do this by wearing hoodies if I'm feeling stressed/anxious, sometimes gloves when I'm at home, or in the winter when I won't look like such a crazy person.  Lately I've been using hydrocolloid bandages on my pimples at night, and besides being awesome at healing them up, it means I can't touch them.\n3.  I try not to look at mirrors any more than I have to.  This is really hard for me because I'm actually quite vain.  I leave the lights in my bathroom off as often as possible (turns out you *can* do most of your skincare routine in the dark), and when I have to see things, I try to use the dimmer setting.

Also, if I know there's a party coming up, I take extra preventative measures, like covering mirrors and wearing gloves for a day or two beforehand.\n5.  This sounds stupid, but I try to go to bed when I'm tired.  Staying up late is my bane.  I wouldn't say I keep a bed time, but when I'm exhausted, I go to bed instead of puttering around doing things with one hand and picking with the other.\n6.  I'm working on being a moisturizer/lotion person to cut down on the itchiness.  In addition, I'm trying not to touch my face/upper arms *even when I'm itchy* (more on this in a second)\n7.  I wear gloves while reading sometimes, or sit on one of my hands, or I skim the book with half my mind while using the other half to focus on keeping both my hands on the book.\n\nIn the past year or two I've gotten a lot better about not picking without realizing it.  My hands used to go on automatic pick-mode any time I wasn't actively using them.  Now, that only happens when I'm *incredibly* tired and/or stressed.\n\nRight now, I'm on a 27-day streak of no picking, which is close to my all-time record (I did 30 days last November).  The biggest thing that's helping me right now is a behavior replacement technique that was recommended to me by /u/rumo_itaki when I first posted in /r/SkincareAddiction:  Whenever I feel like picking or touching my face at all, I make a fist with whichever hand I want to pick with (it's often both) and count to 60.  If the urge hasn't subsided, I count to 120.  I'm almost always under control by the time I get to 120.  For me personally, I do this a lot in response to itchy sensations on my face so that I won't touch my face and go into pick-mode.  I still have a really hard time in front of mirrors, but this has made the \"feeling a bump\" item on my list almost a nonexistent problem.\n\n**I'm looking forward to hearing from other people on this board.

I want to be able to have sex with my SO without worrying about him finding some random patch of ugly out of place hair in an awkward place, or spending 2 hours in the shower trying to make sure I haven't missed any of it. Please tell me i'm not the only one in this position... Just give me some advice.

{"created_utc":1383334686,"selftext":"Hello reddit community.\n\nFirst of all, let me introduce myself. I'm 18 years old student from Europe. Of course English language is not my main, keep it on your mind. As many other students or pupils i have another activity, yeah, it's League of Legends (EU WEST). But everybody can agree with me, that this game makes you feel sad or nervous sometimes. Video games should not make you feel sad. Why i'm talkin' about this? Few things: worst League of Legends community and even worse punishment/rules. As usually i play League every day after school and every day i can spot some idiots or just kinda trolls in my ranked games. No, i'm not bronze as you all might say, i've reached gold division few months ago, and what can i say? Nothing! Everything left the same, there are the same amount of trolls and leavers as in Bronze division. If you think that i'm lying or talking with no sense you can exit this thread. If you're interested in Tribunals and rules changing stay with me and do something. I know that Riot is reading reddit posts sometimes so i want to make this thread as wide as i can. You might ask why i want to change something? Let me give you few examples of what i've been experiencing this week.\n\n2 days ago: As usually simple rankeds day, few games won, few games lost, nothing special, but it was as League is supposed to be. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, try hard or go home.\n\nYesterday: i've won one hard game, and later lost two games. Why? In first of lost games one guy disconnected at start of game cause he didn't get his role, he instalocked another mid, game started and he just left to stay and fountain. Quote: \"hahaha idc about it i can lose cause im in gold already so i cant drop below to silver. riot still wont ban me for one afk game. cya ****\". Second game we had two premades in bot lane. They picked Nidalee and Urgot, i thought everything is fine, Nidalee has a high poke &amp; heal in lane, Urgot is a lil bit tanky if building right, has a good poke too. Sure, everything was fine till 15 min of game. Nidalee was maybe 0/5, urgot 1/6. They disconnected at their last deaths. OK, how we are supposed to win 3x5? Nohow! Of course we lost, they got maybe 5 or 6 reports for leaving, but that makes no sense cause they won't get a ban, maybe a warning one month later, maybe one day ban. This is not a lesson to leavers or trolls. But nevermind, lets check what i've played today.\n\nToday: 4 games. All lost. All with afk'ers. Everybody were feeding and leaving or just not playing since games started. HOW? 4 games in a row, and all lost cause somebody just not in a mood to play. But what did i do? Why i'm always getting these afk'ers in my team? Why sometimes good people (not a leavers) as me or other guys gets into \"elo hell\" cause of trolls and leavers?\n\n--------\n\nOkay, that's enough of my emotional speech, let's talk about what we have to change in Season 4. Someone would agree, someone wouldn't but we need a better Leaver Buster for ranked games. I saw that people leaving games every other day and they are not getting banned. Leaver Buster should instaban for one leave. Maybe not a ban, maybe it could be a ranked games lock. If you leave ranked game once - you can't play ranked games again for one or two days. Yeah, of course sometimes we have to quit cause we have a huge problems or internet issues but it's not other players problems, if they are playing fine and not leaving why they have to lose for other's problems? Here is the another idea: A guy (troll or afk) who gets ~5 reports in one game should get warning that if he gets the same amount of reports in his second game his account will be suspended for a short time. So it could be a good lesson to not troll or leave from game. And there is my last idea. You know that you can block a person which u don't like. It's called mute button. But it's useless. You just can stop his flaming but you still can meet him in your next ranked game. But what if he is a bad player, leaver? Block button should make you never meet that player again in your games. I think it's a nice idea, i thought maybe that mute button does that, but i've met a player today in my game which i've been already ignoring. And yeah, he sucks hard, he went 1/8 in a top lane.\n\nShare your ideas and minds in comments about League has to change.

I&amp;#39;ve always been attracted to older guys, which has been a problem since it means there&amp;#39;s pretty much a 0% possibility of me just happening to meet a guy who&amp;#39;s a good match for me. So my only option for meeting older guys is dating apps, which up until recently I haven&amp;#39;t had the courage to use. But I recently started using Mister and I found a really nice 54 year old guy who I really hit it off with. He&amp;#39;s a college professor, which is a big turn on for me, plus it means we have something in common since I&amp;#39;m a student. So after chatting in text form for a couple weeks, we decided to meet up tonight. Nothing fancy, we just went to Panera to meet up and chat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never kissed, had sex, or been on a date before, so I was super nervous when I got there. Meeting him was honestly the most surreal experience of my life. It&amp;#39;s just so weird to meet up with a guy who&amp;#39;s so much older than me. But I knew it&amp;#39;s what I really wanted, so I was excited to see what it would lead to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how did the date go? It went very badly. It wasn&amp;#39;t long before I stopped being nervous and simply became bored. He was a nice guy, and I liked him, and I&amp;#39;d like to maybe be his friend, but the conversation we had was horrible. He just kept talking and talking. He must have told 50 stories over the course of two hours and there wasn&amp;#39;t a point to any of them. And most of them were negative. He kept telling me how so-and-so was rude and how some person in his life did something mean to him 20 years ago. I did some talking too, and he definitely got to know me throughout the night, but the conversation was probably 90% his words and 10% mine. And it was awkward because some of the stuff he was saying was really personal, so even if he had given me a chance to respond more, half the time I wouldn&amp;#39;t have known what to say. At one point he started talking about why he found himself drawn to my Mister profile, which made me uncomfortable. I thought we were just going to meet up to get to know each other and shoot the shit, not talk about how compatible we are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, even though the date went badly, I&amp;#39;m really happy that I met up with him. Since I&amp;#39;ve never been intimate with anyone before, I&amp;#39;ve always just been gay in theory. Tonight was the first time I&amp;#39;ve ever actually done something gay (meeting up with another guy with the intent to possibly bone,) so it was a nice experience in that regard. And now that I&amp;#39;ve had my first meetup with an older man, I won&amp;#39;t be nearly as anxious the next time I do it, which is good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, that&amp;#39;s my story. Just thought you guys might be interested or whatever.
