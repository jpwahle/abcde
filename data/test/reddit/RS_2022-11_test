I watch like nudes, strip teases and ecchi, (not hentai) and yeah. Is this porn watching just because of the harmonies in puberty or am I missing something. Btw my brain isn't fucked up, I'm not constantly thinking of porn. I am not even exposed that much. I do have blockers set up. So yeah that's the story.

So while i was there, i saw a lot of cute little subs in bunny outfits walking around with their doms who wore masks and suits 🤤 their doms were about a head or two taller and they both just looked so damn good!

I'm 25 now. I had visited this new city new uni with my dad. out of home for the first time. We sit in waiting area. A very strict looking serious lady was also waiting with us. The story's a bit info heavy. Keep up\nSo yeah my dad being the confident man he is. started talking to this lady and she said she is waiting on her daughter who's such smart kid, such good kid and whatnot. I was a lil intrigued cuz I'm the smartest guy at that age that i knew. My dad and the lady's vibin now. Then after a while she came down, we were just leaving. And i see her. I see her. Through the window glass. And I'm stuck. Lemme tell you something about myself I'm a confident well achieved strong mf but I'm scared of my dad but that time i wasnt. I stared her through the glass window. Kept staring hoping she'd look back. She didnt lol\nWent back home. Thought about her all the time back going home. I hadnt felt anything like that ever and ive had crushes. I knew it was something magical and i knew i would see her again. Someday. \nThe storys got a lil spice. Wait for it. \nShe didnt see me. She doesnt know who i am its all nothing from her.\nIts just me grinning my 15 year old ass way back home and thinking about this random girl from a city 200kms away from dont know her name dont know shit.\nThought about her a few days and then i heard my dad talk about the lady with the surname. And with my teenage hacking skills. I fucking found her name. I did. The one who stuck me hard in a look. \nFacebook was big back then, i added her we started talking it went on. She was so innocent i just couldnt resist. My days turned different i had someone to talk to after such dark childhood. And i knew i was in love the moment i saw her. I loved her from the moment 0. The more we talked the more confidence i got that she's my one. A fuckin 15 year old lmao. \nWe never met. We just talked.  I would wait entire day to talk to her. She would too. Talking on a call was a luxury. The moment we got a chance we'd tell each other we loved each other so much. Even tho we were impossible distances apart. It was beautiful. \nThen again how can things just be perfect?\nHer mom found out and being the asian mom she was. She took every social interactiom from her daughter and she disappeared for months. She'd some time sneak out fhe phone text me how much she loves me and disappear again. Eventually her mom found out and she disappeared for good this time. \nBeing the amount of love i was spenting. I was broke inside. \nI was shattered. Imagine the massive abandonment issues i got lmao. \nShe disappeared. I tried all the ways to contact her cuz we never really broke up did we? \nShe talked after a while told me i was ugly and dumped me for good this time maybe? She said later that she just wanted me to stay away? But who knows.  but that shit broke me man. \nI was in love. My first love. I wanted her, and i get what i want. That has been my life motto ever since that day.\nSo i waited around told her i loved her. She did too. And one fine day. She just disappears. Again. Now for good. \nIts been a year still nothing. We lived in differsnt cities we had no mutual friends. I tried to remember all the names she told me i tried to get me to talk to her. Nobody helped. None. I tried shady dark web apps to figure out a way to call her somehow. I was so crazy worried about her and how strict her mom was i wasnt thinking straight. I found this shady app that could change your mobile IP as she wouldnt pick up a random number. I tried everything to contact her. Failed for a year. Then one day it connected but now it has been long. I was still in love with her. She wasnt\n She had moved on found someone else and wss happy. Now i was a troubled friendless weak lil boy with PTSD now. I was at the top floor that moment. Nothing in my life was going right and probably becauss of all this broken heart and weight of love i was carrying. \nAnd it all came down shattered. I thought of jumping off. \nI was that weak. I swear a second less of a thought i'd be dead meat. \nBut i cried one last time, never cried in 10 years after that just and manned up. \nI cut the call. And thats it i no longer tried to contact her. Focused on myself. And i had a massive glowup. I got into the biggest UNI. Made my career, got better looking. Got a strong ass personality.I changed. I'm stronger in evrrything. I'm honestly the toughest mf out there. People respect me. Look up to me. I really did work it out. Ive achieved decently enough in the coming years. Made a lot of money gave back to the fam. A lot of things happened. I fell in love again. And again. And again. Had hard breakups. Fucked around for a while too. Broke some hearts myself. Cuz i was what they say a toxic authoritative male now. Cuz i aint taking shit from anybody now. I'm self indepedent. I'm dependable I'm strong. And i wasnt ready to compromise. But again its easier to accept the dark inside you so i embraced it. Cuz lets be honest? The wounds of a young age never really heal do they? I had a dark childhood too? Remember?\nThat would surface and i'd eventually lose the ones i loved. Again. \nIt has just been ups n downs till now. But I'm overall happy. I'm a nice dude with a lot of friends A LOT of people who love me. Who'd kill for me take a bullet for me. Ive lived a fun, crazy full of interesting stories kinda life. But one thing still kinda bothered me? Does she know how big of a ptsd that was to my lil 15year old self? \nAnd one day i coincidentally meet her again online. We talk i blame her. Cuz its easy yknow? I get my closure. I am a selfish man now. A strong man needs to be selfish. I told her how ive been thriving. I know it wasnt the most mature thing to do. But my lil 15 year old self deserved that. That was one good memory of his from his childhood and it ended so bad. Everything I'm doing rn thriving in my lifr is all for that sad lil 15 year old. \nShe took it gracefully. She realised everything she did. And would throw me her love sometimes too even after 5-6 years everytime she was emotional and i'd be an ass again. I would fight and blame her for good. I never budged. But it eventually healed. I had fallen in lovee yet again a lot harder. And after successfully failing that mission. I decided I'm unlovable and this shit needs to stop. Fucked around for a while and stopped. Now all i do is focus on myself and i keep being the best version of myself. My road to self love. \nLove is lovelier the second time - Frank Sinatra \nThis time i fell in love with myself. I became the best at what i did. Tech. Basketball. Music. Heck i even startsd boxing won a few regionals. \nBut here's a plot twist. I met her last month. For the first time after 9 years of us dating n breaking up? \nAnd idk its just something magical. I saw her very bright. She's brighter to me than everyone else. This time i was burning bright. Too. I felt the light bounce off me. The memories kept rushing back with speed of light. I couldnt say much cuz its been more than 10 years I'm 25 now. Youre adults you act like adults. But i knew my 15 year old one didnt want a revenge. He wanted her back. The one he saw through the tainted glass. The one i met 10 years ago. We talk she's sxactly the type of girl i still look for. The ones ive fell in love with they all were the same type. She was the originator of one of main types. Its just weird seeing her. I'm a big man. I just met her like a friend and we parted ways as friends\nCuz the current me is a lil smart, when you have rose colored glasses on,the red flags look like just flags. And i knew and i didnt love her now. I barely liked her. She never really deserved who I've become right? She never was the one right? Thats why even after forgetting basic history learnt but forgetting every little detail of how i saw her for the first time and how it felt seems impossibls right?

This is um, so very wordy it's spooky.  \n\n\n# Section One: Assets and Debt \n\n**Retirement Balance (and how you got there):** $9,059 in Roth IRA and $135,567 in 403b.  My work creates a 403b account for every FT employee on their 2nd year work anniversary, and automatically deposits 10% of your paycheck (no match needed). From there, it was easy to put in 5% starting in my mid 20s. This is one of the best perks of my job and I am so grateful as I’m nearing my 40s!  For a full picture, I guess my actual compensation is $95,700.\n \n**Equity:**  Mint.com says 1.2 mil but I have no clue.  I live in a multi-generational home with my parents, my sister, and a niece who is in her last year of college but will move back after graduation.  As a first generation household, we were lifelong renters until the landlords put the house for sale in 2013 with little notice.  After a stressful couple of months, and with the help of family and friends, I moved back home and we were able to purchase the home and became homeowners. It’s a single family home but my dad renovated it so it functions as two separate living units; I live on the top with my niece and my folks and sister are on the bottom floor.  We can rent out the top floor for passive income if needed.  I genuinely don’t know if I will be able to afford a home in the Bay if I meet someone.  Buuuuut I try not to think often about Bay Area real estate (or dating in your late 30s) lest I spiral lol.\n\n**Savings account balance:**  $13,173 total.  With $10k earmarked emergency fund and the rest split into fun fund and property tax buckets.\n\n**Checking account balance:** $3607\n\n**I-Bonds:** $5088, got that sweet sweet interest rate this summer.\n\n**Investment account balance:** $15,098 with e-trade. \n\n**Credit card debt (and how you accumulated it):** $3077 right now, but I pay everything in full each month.  Highlights from this period include Disneyland tickets for December, incredibly expensive but SO VERY PRETTY Halloween nail polish, and a pair of Allbirds because I needed new sneakers.\n\n\n# Section Two: Income\n\n**Income Progression:** I've been working with this company since 2008.  I started as an assistant in 2008 with $35,000.  A series of 4% to 5% pay annual increase followed, until 2013 when I was promoted into an assistant manager role, which came with a 10% raise plus the normal 5% pay increase.  I received another promotion in 2019 so another 15% pay increase.\n\n**Main Job Monthly Take Home:**  Around $4400 monthly after tax.\n\n\n# Section Three: Expenses\n\n**Mortgage:** $2668, my mom gives me $1200 and I pay the rest, usually $100 more so about $2788 a month.  We refinanced at an incredible fixed 15 year rate in 2020, so I am very motivated to pay this off ASAP.\n\n**Home insurance:**My sister pays so I don’t know.\n\n**Retirement contribution:** $50 to the Roth IRA, really due to inertia than anything else (did not count the 5% pre tax to 403b)\n\n**Savings contribution:** $650 a month to the various buckets mentioned in section one (emergency fund, property tax, fund fund)\n\n**Investment contribution:** $100 a month to E-trade, even though the total gets lower the more money I put in this year.  \n\n**Electric\/Gas:** Parents pay, we range about $110 - $200.  Electric is cheap since we are leasing solar panels, but gas can vary greatly depending on how much we use the heater.  \n\n**Wifi\/\/Landline:** $65.97 for Wifi and a landline with an independent provider.  I hope to never pay Comcast another cent.\n\n**Cellphone:** I’m on a group plan with friends so I pay about $31 a month for unlimited data with Google Fi\n\n**Subscriptions:** NYT $17, Experian Credit Reporting $14.95, Netflix $15.49.  I also paid $30 to a friend for her Disney+ when they were having a promotion.  I believe this will cover me for 2 years.  I’m on my friend’s Spotify Premium, and my parents get HBO Max for free through their cell phone services.  I also paid for a year of Apple+ at $99 but really need to cancel that because no one uses it.\n\n**Gym membership:** $41 a month to use the gym where I train with my personal trainer.  Training sessions are $100 each and I pay $500 every month or two (we don’t meet every week due to scheduling).\n\n**Pet expenses:** Family dog (K) takes anti-anxiety meds, and her meds are $80 every 3 months.  Our vet behavorist prescribed the human version of anti-anxiety meds for our pup as it was cheaper.   Annual home vet visit is usually $120 - $200.  My dad pays for the grooming and dog food.  We make our own chicken jerky for the princess as snacks, and she gets peanut butter in a kong and with her meds, to keep the cost down for dog treats.\n\n**Car payment \/ insurance:** I don’t have a car but pay $60 -$80 a month for public transportation (Clipper Card), this is pre-tax.\n\n**Paid hobbies:** I take surveys for Usercrowd for cash.  It's not much but it's honest work.\n\n#Money Diary\n\n**MONDAY**\n\n\nCo-worker texted the previous night that she threw out her back and won’t be in to open for the morning shift.  Boss and I both move up our scheduled start times to accommodate.  (Changing my alarm almost 2 hours earlier on Sunday night was a deep  kind of hurt).  It actually worked out since my sister’s office days start at 8am and she’s also in Downtown SF.  So we commuted in together.  By “commuted” I mean we took the metro together and snoozed until our stop, ha!\nGot into work at 7:45am. I have been on a decaf kick lately to help with my sleep, but today really called for a cup of coffee or 2.  Boss had the breakfast laid out so I really didn’t have anything to do until the attendees arrive.  We do professional development training, and my office days are dependent on when we have live events.  \n\nAfter the morning rush, boss and I talked about how we miss bagels as we’re both gluten intolerant.  She recommended Odd Bagels.  I looked on their website, and impulse bought both the onion and everything bagels.  ($20.93)\n\nI work so much work.  It’s a hectic day and while I like being in the office (my coworkers are good peeps), I do get pulled into various different tasks and projects.  A few things are left uncompleted on my to-do list, but I managed all the time sensitive ones, so I’ll take it.  I pack up my laptop and other things as I’m working remote the next 2 days.  Out the door by 5:45pm.\n\nI’m home by 6:30pm!  K is already fed so I just take her to the backyard for some fetch and a few scritches and ask her about her day before I sit down to dinner.  We try to sit down to family dinner every night if we can, and rotate cooking depending on scheduling.  It is so nice to have that option to not cook after a long day. \n\nIt’s been a long day and my brain is fried.  I watch some vlogs on Youtube, hop in the shower, do my skincare and get to bed around 11:30.\n\n*Monday total: $20.93\n\n\n\n**TUESDAY**\n\n\nI wake up 30 minutes before my alarm and feel rested despite getting less than 7 hours of sleep.  I check my email and scroll Reddit in bed before nature calls and I’m up by 8:30.  I get ready for the morning, throw on some makeup because I have a morning Zoom.  I normally make a drip coffee if I’m working from home, but I don’t have any decaf grounds so I make a decaf nespresso.  I’m ready for work by 9….ish.\n\n11:42am Call done, working on other things and then, earthquake!  I immediately went to Google and R\/sanfrancisco to confirm.  Other co-workers in SF also posted about it in Slack.  It was a 5.1 in the south bay.  You get used to them living in CA, but this one shook for much longer.  Normally the smaller earthquakes are so short you play the “was that an earthquake or a really big truck passing by” game.  \n\nLunch at 12 since the earthquake threw me off. I don’t usually eat breakfast, so I guess this is brunch.  I have a pack of portobello mushrooms about to go bad, so I make a spinach and mushroom omelet with some leftover sweet potatoes.  I also say hi to doggo and see if she needs to go out for a pee (she does not, the princess is sleeping in).  My friend texted our group chat about SF Restaurant Week.  We make reservations for a restaurant I’ve been waiting to try for Friday night.  It’s so popular they only have an 8:30pm available.  Granny here eats at 6pm, but I rally because I REALLY want to try their uni creme brulee.  You prepay with the reservations, and it came out to $102.33 per person.  My friend paid, so I venmoed her later.\n\nRest of the afternoon flies by.  I stop working around 3pm but keep my laptop open for any emails or slack.  I work on my Vote Forward letters in the meantime.   I hope the letters can persuade at least one person to vote.  I also hope they can make out my horrible handwriting!\n\nIt’s 5:00pm and I officially log off.  I feed K and give her meds, and we play a nice game of fetch and she barks at random birds who have the audacity to fly over our yard.  We head back in and I chat with my mom a bit as we heat up leftovers.  My sister also made chicken soup and it is now definitely chilly enough for soup.  We have dinner, my dad shared some worrying news about his brother\/my uncle.  He’s recently diagnosed with late stage colon cancer and it’s spread, a lot.  Uncle lives in Shanghai and the zero policy Covid meant that he was suffering for a month before he was able to get an appointment and diagnosis due to all the disruptions to services. China still has a 10 day quarantine so it will be difficult and expensive for my dad to fly back.  It's a whole mess, and we are all worried.\n\nI clean up the kitchen a bit and wash the dishes, and it’s time to relax. I finish the night with some Netflix and Sims 4.  …I stay up waaay too late playing Sims.\n\n*Tuesday total: 102.33\n\n\n**WEDNESDAY**\n\n\nI wake up at 8:30 and get ready for the morning. No calls = just some sunscreen and lotion.  Not too groggy, so I make tea and log in by 9am.  My calendar looks suspiciously empty, so I double-check my emails and Slack to make sure I didn’t forget anything.  I didn’t!   I work on my self-appraisal (what’s a fancy way of saying “please give me more money, but not more responsibilities?), and slack with my direct report.  We hired 5 additional people this year (a huge percentage when you’re originally an office of 12), with 4 newly created roles.  One new role was a coordinator for my team.  I check in with her as we have some repairs scheduled at the office and see if she has any questions about upcoming tasks.  I don’t like being micromanaged so I do my best to not micromanage, and I think it’s been working out well.\n\nI open the fridge at 11:30am, and the box of portobello mushrooms stared back balefully.  I decide on miso soup with mushroom and spinach, and air fried salmon over rice.  It was delicious.  \n\nLunch time break to see the pup!  She’s out in the yard, keeping my mom company as she works in the garden.  We get a rare day of sun, so K is soaking up the rays and living her best life.\n\nAfter lunch I check in with my coworker who called out on Monday.  She had to go to the ER due to the pain, but thankfully is now recovering.  Doctor’s note will be submitted to HR and she has some limitations in mobility for 3 weeks.  I ask her to check with my coordinator so she can make any accommodations needed for Thursday, her first day back at work.  I also get a proof of life from my boss, who has been battling a lingering cold for over a week.  I make a note to take Emergen-C with dinner.  \n\nI work out some details for a high level meeting for 2023.  I’m reviewing a hotel contract and negotiating the terms, like I’m someone who has the authority to do that?  Almost 15 years and I still can’t shake the sense of imposter syndrome.  I channel my best “fake it until you make it” energy and called the sales manager and pushed back politely on the terms.  It escalated to the director and we reached a compromise (aka where no one gets what they actually want!), but the executive team is pleased with the results so I’ll take the win.\n\nAs usual, work slows down around 3pm, I check in with a coworker on a marketing project, and then spend the rest of my work day on Vote Forward letters until 5pm.\n\nDinner was a blur, the news regarding my uncle is not great.  He’s not eating, and is just in constant pain.  The doctor estimates anywhere from 3 months to a week left. I also learned that my cousins are doing the plot from “the Farewell”, and not telling the rest of the family in China just how dire it is.  They only told my dad the truth.  We did a quick family prayer after dinner at around 7:30pm.  I feel emotionally raw.  Listlessly spent the rest of the night trying to build a house for my legacy family in Sims, and turned in around 11pm.\n\n*Wednesday total: $0\n\n\n**THURSDAY**\n\n\nWoke up around 7:45am, hopped out of bed to get ready as I’m going into the office today.  I do sunscreen and makeup, change really quickly and grab a gluten free bagel for breakfast later.  K is eating her breakfast so I say goodbye and head out.\n\nMade it into the office around 9ish.  A coworker from our east coast office is visiting, so I say hi and we caught up as I got my coffee.  We want to go over some workflow procedures, but she is slammed, so we reschedule for the afternoon. Boss is still sick, so I check in with her quickly about an overhaul in procedures we’re working on before she leaves for the day.  I sit down and deal with Slack and emails.  I try the gluten free bagel around 11, and it’s pretty tasty.  I continue working on the 2023 meeting and some materials due next week, before taking my lunch at 12:30.  My coworker and I head down the block to grab prepared meals.  I get a salad and a probiotic drink ($20.90).  I eat lunch at the break room because I need to step away from my computer a bit.  I also realized I felt really good after the probiotic drink, so I finally got around to reordering the probiotic I normally take on Amazon ($28.23). \n\nThe class had a 5:30 end time, and the afternoon *dragged*.  I spend some time working on my self-appraisal and putting notes together for my coordinator’s review, while chatting on the side and trying to answer my friend’s questions about I-bonds. I leave the office around 5:45 after chatting with the instructors.\n\nCommute was a breeze and I’m home before 6:30!  The rest of the family are eating already, so I quickly take doggo out for some exercise (she is more active at night) and her post-dinner potty break if needed.  I have some leftover steak from Wednesday night and some home grown spaghetti squash. After dinner my parents head to bible study, so I help with washing the dishes, and give K her kong toy as she settles for the night.  I head back up to my kitchen and do some light cleaning and also prepare a sandwich for lunch tomorrow.  For those keeping track, the mushrooms are still there; waiting… spoiling.  I might have to admit defeat and throw them out with the Monday compost.\n\nI finish off the night by lighting a candle and do my full skincare routine (double cleanse, active, toner the whole kit and caboodle). Also used a shower bomb in my shower as well for a real treat yo’self moment. I have two episodes left in a k-drama (Hotel Del Luna), and tried to finish it.  However, the penultimate episode felt like a weird filler episode unrelated to the plot, so I lose interest quickly.  I alternate scrolling Reddit and IG in bed before falling asleep around 12am.\n\n*Thursday total: $49.13\n\n\n**FRIDAY**\n\n\nTGIF!  I have to go into the office today but at least it’s a short day.  I do the morning things and am out the door by 8:30.  There’s usually coffee at work, but I swing by Starbucks since I have money left from a giftcard from work.  The oatmilk apple crisp macchiato is a delight, I get an extra shot of espresso (#justFridaythings) and pick up the drink on my way into work at 9….ish.\n\nMy boss is out sick, so I check with my team to see if they have questions.  I don’t bother her on sick or vacation days unless absolutely necessary because she has a hard time shutting off and will respond immediately. We are in good shape.  I head to my office and get some work done.  I stop by my coworker’s office about a technical issue that has ballooned and can potentially turn into a Very Big Security Issue if we don’t fix it soon, and try to come up with different strategies.  \n\nI finally get to sit down with my visiting coworker, but we spend most of the time talking about our respective European summer vacations  and catching up on office tea (oops!) We tweak the process a little bit, and strategize over how to advocate for her coming to the west coast office more often. \n\nBecause I really want to leave by 4:30, I take my lunch at my desk and I eat my sandwich at about 12.  Having a bagel for breakfast AND a sandwich for lunch was not the best idea, it was a lot of carbs and I struggled to stay awake from 2 - 3pm.  We have a very busy week coming up, so I had a meeting with my coordinator regarding the schedule next week.   We talk about the upcoming year end review, this will be her first and she’s nervous.  My belief is that any review period should not contain surprises, and we go over the review process so she’s not caught unaware.  She is a stellar addition to the team, and I tell her so.  We talk about logistics for an early Thanksgiving event for the office, because we all could use some sugar and refined carbs.\n\nI casually start packing up at 4pm, say good bye to the instructors and answer any questions, and I’m out the door by 4:30 successfully!  It takes me just about 35 minutes to get home.  I am both excited and regretting my 8:30pm dinner reservations because I’m feeling old.  I have an extra long fetch and sniff around session with the dog to tire her out, and I skipped family dinner and took a quick nap.  \n\nI call an Uber at 8pm ($17.91) and I’m at the restaurant at 8:30pm on the dot.  My friends are already seated, and we proceeded to have a lovely meal.  We prepaid for the 3 courses, but added on some wine and 2 uni creme brulee to share as starters.  They were creamy and rich and absolutely decadent. Sometimes you eat for the body, sometimes you eat for the soul.   We caught up and chatted and ended the meal around 10pm, while making ambitious plans for Friendsgiving and succulents DIY workshops.  I paid for all of us since it was Friday night and no one wanted to math.  ($149.18)  We walk one friend to her car, and my other friend and I called Ubers home ($16.94).\n\nI was super awake after the dinner, so I did my full skincare routine again and watched Youtube until 1am.  YOLO?\n\n*Friday total: $184.31 (though I will be reimbursed for parts of dinner)\n\n\n**SATURDAY**\n\n\nI sleep in until 9:30am.  (My parents usually take K out for the morning routine, but she doesn’t mind sleeping in on weekends.  She’s way more active in the evening, which works out great for me.)\n\nI’m scrolling through IG and see that a bagel shop I thought had already closed is still open for weekend service until the end of October. I am intrigued because they serve sourdough bagels, and I am able to tolerate a long ferment sourdough.  I use my $5 credit on Doordash and place an order for a bacon, eggs, and cheese bagel and half a dozen bagels to try out.  ($37.04)  It is a very delicious bagel, and I wash it down with some coffee. I watch a Youtube video on a prawns curry recipe and that sounds really good.  I’m missing a few staples in my fridge and pantry as well, so I do an Instacart order from Sprouts (a slightly fancier supermarket).  I’m pleasantly surprised by the deals, and also forgot I have free delivery and $15 cash back from a credit card promotion.  I fill up my cart (including some cream cheese because I am shot in the ass with bagels oops) and check out ($98.00)\n\nIt’s also the day we send off Vote Forward letters, so as I’m waiting for my Instacart delivery, I quickly prepare the envelopes and slapped on “Be a Voter!” stickers. I drop off 40 letters and feel like I should have done more, sigh. \n\nI’m home in a flash and help my mom with some computer issues, and then get my Instacart delivery.  I celebrate by eating ANOTHER sourdough bagel with my newly acquired cream cheese.  It’s 3pm on a Saturday, all I’ve had today was gluten, so naturally I took a nap.  I woke up at 6pm feeling like I had a rock in the pit of my stomach, and had a light dinner of chicken soup and veggies.  K had no interest in exercising, I think because her and my mom did a long fetch and zoomies session this afternoon.  So I just walked a few laps in my yard as the sun sets.\n\nI work on this MD a bit (2 meta), and then settle in to finish Hotel Del Luna with some microwave popcorn.  The last 2 episodes turned out to be an hour and 30 minutes EACH, so I didn’t finish until 11:30.  I stayed up another hour looking up the lead actress’ music videos and vlogs, and she is adorable.  I was too sleepy to shower, so I washed my face and brushed my teeth and crawled into bed at about 1am.\n\n*Saturday total: $135.04\n\n\n**SUNDAY**\n\n\nI have weird dreams and slept through my church alarm.  I laze in bed and got up to shower around 10am.  I make my coffee and tried to watch the recording of the church livestream, but I’m distracted by my phone. T__T This is why I really need to attend in-person service, despite how absolutely convenient live streams are.  I give up and make myself ANOTHER bagel with eggs.  I also defrosted an ahi poke kit last night and I plan to have that for lunch.  The news from Itaewon is absolutely horrific, but I cannot stop looking at the videos.  I take a break to go hug my dog and brush her coat out.  She naps while I prepare my poke bowl with some brown rice  around 2pm.  This bowl is delicious, and it’s a better value than if I buy it from a poke place.\nI work off some of that poke bowl by cleaning the bathrooms and kitchen. I stare at my laundry to see if I can squeeze out another week without washing, and alas, I cannot.  So I start the laundry as well.\n\nDinner is more poke bowl because it was a hefty portion.  I watch Youtube reviews on horror movies I’m too scared to watch in theaters, and fold and put away laundry.  I have a headache, so I watch Youtube a little bit longer before turning in at 10pm.  Very exciting Sunday!\n\n*Sunday total: $0\n\n\n\nCategory| Amount\n---|---\nFood + Drink | $428.38\nHome + Health| $28.23\nFun \/ Entertainment| $0\nClothes + Beauty | $0\nTransport| $34.85\n\n\n \n\nThis is a pretty common week for me, though I normally don’t buy all the bagels or get groceries delivered.  I try to save my beauty and clothing purchases for sales and stock up then.  For example, if this diary took place during Sephora’s VIB sale the totals will look VERY different.  Overall, it's a pretty accurate snapshot.  This has been helpful as I do really want to ramp up on savings as the big \"R\" word looms in 2023.  \n\n\nThanks again for reading!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MoneyDiariesACTIVE","subreddit_id":"t5_12n5pd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/MoneyDiariesACTIVE","subreddit_subscribers":56387,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Title: I am 38 years old, make $87,000, live in San Francisco in a multi-generation household, work in nonprofit, and this week I bought so many bagels.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.93,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MoneyDiariesACTIVE\/comments\/yitnea\/title_i_am_38_years_old_make_87000_live_in_san\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I am just so tired of feeling and being completely lonely 24\/7. Most people I grew up with have either moved away or just never want to do anything. It's always me who has to initiate conversations, or else I'm never talked to. Each morning I wake up, I'm.immediately ready to hang with people and make plans but nobody does alllll day and night long. It's always me initiating everything and told generic bullshit like \"yeah, for sure!\" when I tell people that we should hangout soon sometime, meanwhile I'm anxiously hovering over my phone 24\/7 waiting for those people to get back to me, but they never do.\n\nI just don't get how people can \"forget\" that easily about another human being. I don't get how people's favorite excuse is that they're \"busy\" but then be posting themselves out and about with other people. But me? When I tell someone I'll get back to them, I do so ASAP the same-day, usually the same hour. I make people a priority. I'm constantly craving attention and just wanting to be around people, but it never happens......\n\nPeople have told me things like, \"oh, just don't keep those people in your life then\" etc etc, but it's like, yeah, OK, then I'll truly have nobody to even talk to. I'm in a very small town. I rather wait by my phone like some lost puppy waiting for its owner to get home from work everyday on the chance that someone might message me than totally just cut those people off and truly have nobody at all. It's so beyond sad.\n\nVideo games? Fun for like a hour. TV\/Movies? Boring. Reading? Eh. Being outside and walking around? Love to do this but I do this every single day and just see the same things all the time. I'm just so bored of everything when I'm alone and my typical day is waking up, messaging people to hang out, walking to liquor store, then walking to one of my select outdoor drinking spots (woods, railroad tracks, etc.), then waiting and praying for someone to message me all day.\nI hate this. So, so much. I go to bars and meet people there sometimes but it's so pointless to me because these people never last in my life. I really only go for the compliments I'll get (\"you're really attractive \") and it's like, \"thanks, we should hang out sometime\" but then nothing comes of it. I'm just so sick of feeling bored and lonely.\n\nOnline friends are nice to an extent but most drift off and never message unless I yet again initiate it. I guess this is just my rant. I'm so done with people being shitty and ignoring obvious cries for help and company then just seeing that and doing nothing about it. Not even checking in to see of I'm OK or anything. Not a word. I miss my childhood and early teen years, where I had a nice neighborhood of friends. Screw today's people my age who don't give a damn about anyone else or always use the \"busy\" excuse, etc etc. How truly \"busy\" can someone be, ya know? I literally cut my grass, walk around town, do work stuff, etc. and can still respond super quick to people. Because I make them a priority.

I wore a cute Bratz crop top, pretty glitter and make-up, and a pink pleated latex mini skirt that just barely covered my bum. For context I'm 5'7\", long black hair, olive skin, with pretty average boobs but a nice round booty.\n\nI ended up really getting along well with a handsome guy who was dressed as a plumber. He challenged me to a game of beer pong and despite knowing that I would lose since I'm pretty bad I still agreed to bet that if I lost I would let him \"lay pipe\" since I kinda wanted to hookup with him anyways.\n\nWe went to his room as he was one of the roommates who was hosting. We kissed, and he groped me, eventually removing my top and bra. Then I got down on my knees, unzipped his pants, and took out his white cock, which was about 7 inches long. I held his balls in one hand while wrapping my lips around the tip of his dick and worked my way down the shaft towards the base of his cock with his blond pubes. He played with my boobs, especially my nipples, as I bobbed my head up and down sloppily.\n\nWe had only been at it for a few minutes when we were interrupted by a large amount of noise and commotion just outside the room. He exited the room, and I peered out the door to see the cops by the front door. The police had arrived to break up the party and were kicking everyone out who didn't live there, so I sat quietly on the bed until almost everyone had left.\n\nWe ended up picking up where we left off afterwards, but it was definitely an awkward situation lol.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SluttyConfessions","subreddit_id":"t5_33rc6","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/SluttyConfessions","subreddit_subscribers":1058874,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I (f18) was interrupted giving a blowjob at a Halloween party","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.97,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SluttyConfessions\/comments\/yits7d\/i_f18_was_interrupted_giving_a_blowjob_at_a\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

We are currently living together after I moved past. Before I get him to my grandparents and told her, if she admits it, I'm dressing better, exercising and getting flu. Underneath my face been sleeping with someone like me....I am only in the blink of an EU emotionally unavailable and into it apparently he'd have his daughter should be distant at first and foremost. Many women seem to be happy to hear from him so I wasn't faithful to me. \n\nAfter struggling to summarize but essentially here is similar. There's nothing any man could do whatever it is very hot women as they're looking for anything except a hug when he felt guilty and wants nothing to everyone. She doesn't see her as she was super cool chick and I don't know what to do or say, any help would be a vacation to another country with my girlfriend that he loved me that I no longer lives with me. Like I'm getting mixed signals. I'm 23, and going to be ok with my feelings, I strongly believe that if it wasnt for Kristen i wouldnt have the movie Loving Vincent, which she agreed to meet and he says im gorgeous. I don't want to be accepting falsely because she doesn't seem attracted to skinny girls. Boyfriend got his headset on. I drove him back to my concerns which are the demographic that clearly care so little of my life, yatta yatta. \n\nWhat confuses me is that I would love to date again. TL;DR Boyfriend wishes I was in working hours. Another major issue for him and didn't need anyone else and we see each other and the more time to find a genuine change with an empathetic, understanding, adventurous, ambitious, and youthful spirit. I went to different guys. I've been moping over her just felt that I found that I love you as flirting especially when it comes to dating, sex, and do change and evolve. I don't know, but just happening. This is when I was not dating right now it should be more disciplined. She'd disappear for a minute away from our current spat that something was going on dates with different doctors labs, ex also tested positive.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"getthatguy","subreddit_id":"t5_781vx8","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/getthatguy","subreddit_subscribers":22,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Signs a guy is hurt after a breakup","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.66,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/getthatguy\/comments\/yitwra\/signs_a_guy_is_hurt_after_a_breakup\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

First you have fast food which has just marked everything up beyond recognition. Places don't have a dollar menu anymore which I can accept but even $2 is a rarity. They've even raised the price of things like sweet tea and fountain drinks which were always 1000% markups to begin with. Then the \"meals\" now cost pretty much the same as you would pay at a low-mid scale restaurant for a meal (Think applebees or such)\n\nThen it gets even worse with how badly restaurants in general are scamming us. You can't find a basic burger and fries for less than $11 it seems and appetizers are priced almost at meal prices for the basic, cheapest things you can cook. Onion rings, fried pickles, cheese sticks, these things should NOT cost $8 when it's literally Cheap Ingredient X rolled in a basic egg\/flour combo and deep fried. These places even charge you over $10 for salads most of the time. All of this and they can't even be bothered to pay their staff so the average person has to tip them an additional $5+ (5 being the lowest I'll go even if my bill is only 15 or so which takes away an additional 1\/3 of a meal from my pocket) just to not feel like a scumbag.\n\nEdit: Some clarifications 1. I'm not talking about your town's mom and pop location. I'm talking mostly about Sysco places and sit down chains. \n\n2. I'm aware of the current fact the world is kind of dying right now between global warming, the wars, the shipping issues, etc. But if you're smart enough to use those as points, you should also be smart enough to know that a lot of these companies are using them as an excuse to hurt the people more than they already are. There are always outside factors that make things go up a bit in price (my grandfather owned a farm, the price just of corn to feed livestock after the corn farms started selling to ethanol is a huge part of why meat prices are bs now) but these corporations as well as the stores that sell food for the same markup shouldn't be defended.\n\n3. I know what inflation is. If you are smart enough to bring up inflation, I want you to also be smart enough to understand that inflation is a natural part of an economy that is NOT acting natural in America (where I'm from) and is being made worse and pushed along by owners of these franchises while they fight against the idea that their employees should be paid more.

My name is Samantha and I am looking for some long term roleplay partners!!  I am 31 years old, so I would much rather my partners be at least 20+, closer to my age is better. I am engaged in RL. My fiance does know about my roleplaying, this is just something I do for fun and to kinda help distract me from my depression and anxiety. I just figured I would put that out there as well.\n\n\nMy Time Zone is Easteren time zone and I work the evening shift (2pm-12am) . I have Fridays and Saturdays off And around most of the day on my days off. The day’s i work I am around from 12:30am till around 4:00am. Sometimes I will be around before work.\n\n\nI have been roleplaying for about 13 years now, I do third person writing, I can write paragraphs. But it also depends on what my roleplaying partner gives me.  I do prefer the roleplays to be at least 2-4 sentences. The longer the better though, the more would be 3 paragraphs, I can do more but it can take a while to do. \n\n\nI am pretty much up for any kinda roleplay,  we can discuss many things, I have many interests.  Vampires, werewolves, witches. Friends turned lovers.  Maybe the exes are getting back together. Enemies become lovers, best friends become lovers. Mafia and Gang related roleplays. Pretty much anything!\n\n\nWhat kinda stories i have been craving though are listed below;\n\n\nWhat Happens In Vegas!!: So with this storyline I was pretty much thinking that either both my girl and the guy end up in Vegas or maybe the guy lives in Vegas and my girl visits for vacation. They hook up. Maybe get married, she could get pregnant. Maybe they are working on getting an annulment when she finds out she is pregnant.\n\n\nNight Terrors: my girl would have night terrors because of the way she grew up. I was thinking the only way she can sleep or get any type of sleep is with a guy that steals her heart. They come from different worlds. They have many ups and downs.  Could even go their separate ways for a while. But they find peace with each other.\n\n\nHighschool Sweethearts: so i was thinking for this one that my girl would be 2 years younger than the guy they dated in highschool. She had skipped a few grades, they dated for 2 years, after graduating she finds out that she is pregnant, she leaves, the guy would be big into sports and would be wanting to go pro and she didn’t want to ruin that for him so she didn’t tell him. She leaves and comes back 4 years later with an adorable 3 year old boy who looks just like her ex.\n\n\nFighting For Love: so for this one i was thinking something similar to the Highschool sweetheart one. Two young lovers, the guy is into either illegal underground fighting or maybe an MMA fighter or maybe he does both. My girl wants to be a nurse. So it would kinda work  out maybe she could be there and help him after fights. Maybe she gets pregnant and leaves, he doesn’t know but she comes back, while she was gone he had gotten into some bad stuff, but he tries to turn his life around when she comes back with his kid.\n\n\nMafia Oh Mafia!!: So I love Mafia stories!  The first idea to have for the mafia is, two rival gangs, one has an heir that is a female and the other has an heir that is male, they secretly fall for each other.  They  have run into each other a few times and they can’t stand each other, thinking that maybe they go back and forth with each other and then they end up making out and going a little further, and they slowly start to get to know each other and fall in love.\n\n\nThe next Mafia story I had in mind was  my girl is a nurse and is working the late night shift and stops to get gas. Maybe while she is stopped at the gas station a guy who is in the mafia has been injured and sees her, he kidnaps her and forces her to take care of him. His plan was to kill her after she healed up but he ended up falling for her and her for him in the process of being kidnapped.\n\n\nLions, Tigers and Bears Oh My!: So I had gotten back into my animal shifter phase! And a storyline that I had in mind was that my girl is a weaker wolf. She is smaller and she is a little weaker, mostly because a wolf pack had kidnapped her from her pack and had kept her held hostage since she was  a white wolf who is supposed to be the most powerful wolf. They are the king and queens of wolves and are rare, one is born every 100 years on the winter solstice, but the kicker is she would end up having two mates!! Twin brothers. Now I do prefer them to be wolves but I am up for discussing them being something else, another shifter or vampires.  \n\n\nThree's Company: I also have a thing for three way roleplays. I had an idea of a girl working for a big company where she has two bosses who happen to be good friends and have been since they were kids, and she ended up being with them both.  Was thinking maybe it could start with her being with one, then her getting to be with the other. And maybe they find out about each other. And to punish her then decide to tag team her, she ends up falling for both of them and has to choose. Which one does she want to be with? Does she want to be with both? How will she ever decide?\n\n\nSugarbaby \/ Sugardaddy:  roleplay, my girl would be 20-22 years old, in college. Maybe she had a rough upbringing and she was working putting herself through college, maybe she lost her job and the girl she goes to school with told her about becoming a Sugar baby. And she goes to a sugarbaby meeting. She meets a guy who is interested. I was thinking that he could be 30-40 years old, he would be hot and sexy. Maybe he would be some big hotshot CEO or some other big well known person around town. It's just supposed to be for him to just have a woman on his arm out in public but maybe they actually end up having feelings for each other.\n\n\nThe Girl NextDoor: So with this one i was thinking a young girl (18-21) lives with her single father or single mother. They get a new neighbor. The guy would be older. Like late 20’s to early 30’s maybe mid 30s. He would befriend her father and see her in a bikini by the poolside, out in her little outfits. They start a secret relationship. Was thinking maybe she had a boyfriend at the start, and maybe the guy has females in and out of his place. There could be some jealousy between the two when they see the other with somebody. They could start the affair while she was with her boyfriend.\n\n\n\nThe One That Got Away: I was thinking maybe some ex-lovers met back up and they reconnected with each other.  Maybe they were high school sweethearts. They got engaged and were supposed to get married, the engagement was over and one of them left town, 5 years passed and they came back.  Maybe it could be like the 10 year school reunion. They run into each other and start reminiscing about the old times. And maybe end up getting back together. There could be some things stopping it from being quick. Maybe one of them has a lover. And it could just be a slow burn.\n\n\nThose are just a few of the storylines I am craving, but if I am up for any type of roleplay, I would discuss anything!!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"roleplaying","subreddit_id":"t5_2s4ef","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/roleplaying","subreddit_subscribers":13922,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"F4M (Long-Term)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/roleplaying\/comments\/yitzpp\/f4m_longterm\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

You looked better in 2019 naturally, with no hair dye, tattoos, and piercings. It's like when I was shopping at Hot Topic at 30 years old. 5 years from now you'll regret your transformation from a normal person into Satan. Lol.\n\n***Post 02:***\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still find you cute even with the Satan look. I like your vibrations and energy. That's why I'm sharing it with you because I know you could present so much better. You have potential. So clean up!\n\n***Post 03:***\n\nI don't believe you were cheating on me. Actually, through the internet, I was the one who cheated. But you were lying to and gaslighting me. Also, I wish you shared with me that you were involved with a billionaire prior to meeting me. Personally, I'm not happy about it.\n\n***Post 04:***\n\nI need to remember even if what I SUSPECT is true. You're my ex-girlfriend. You're barely in my life anymore. We shared genuine love and great experiences. You helped me tremendously. I love you. Who cares who you were involved with prior to me? I wish I knew back then, though.\n\n***Post 05:***\n\nI might actually be sick and dying from terminal illness. Maybe there's a higher power that's curing my of cancer. Maybe it's God. Maybe it's the billionaire. If my life isn't over, it's time to move on from my ex-girlfriend. I will always love you. But it's been over for a year.\n\n***Post 06:***\n\nI have a SUSPICION pretty soon I'll be transitioning from my ex-girlfriend, who I do love, but you LIED, to the artistic woman who looks like Satan right now. Maybe it's a Halloween costume? I'm sorry it didn't work out between us. The relationship had a lot of potential.\n\n***Post 07:***\n\nI know the surprise was supposed to be like Sandy from Grease. Your intentions were always good. You're an amazing person. I love you. The tragic thing that happened is my fault in many ways. But you did lie. Maybe it can still be salvaged? It's sad - we had so much potential.\n\n***Post 08:***\n\nI just want to be unconditionally loved by someone. I felt like you truly loved me and I truly loved you. Our love for each other was genuine. We always had good intentions for each other. So maybe mistakes can be forgiven - even if they're huge mistakes.\n\n***Post 09:***\n\nEven if the billionaire has the ability to read my mind, who cares? I don't know what is in other people's minds, but I'm willing to bet I'm pretty wholesome and innocent in comparison. Also, I have no deep dark secrets. I've like literally said everything on social media already\n\n***Post 10:***\n\nI want a girlfriend who is honest with me and I'll be honest with her. What you see is what you get with me. Even if she does have some deep dark secrets, I'd like her to tell me, not hide her past from me. I understand you don't have to share everything about past relationships.\n\n***Post 11:***\n\nI really hope my first girlfriend wasn't involved with my father on the sly, lying to me while dating me. My father has been lying to me about his wealth. If my father and ex-girlfriend were bullying me, I really hope I don't have a kid that's being kept secret from me.\n\n***Post 12:***\n\nIs it possible that billionaires not only have the cure for cancer, they could give you cancer if they want, or save your life? Can they implant chips to read your mind? Or do they not have that much power? A billionaire can't perform a miracle and cure me of a terminal illness.\n\n***Post 13:***\n\nThe higher power that's reaching out to me has to be God, not some capitalistic billionaire with advanced technology, unless I underestimate how much power and technology the richest people in the world actually have access to. Maybe he knows the secret to immortality?\n\n***Post 14:***\n\nI really don't want to go to the emergency room if I don't have to, but I'm starting to have difficulty swallowing food. It's becoming a problem. I plan to do blood work in two days then a physical a week from now. I wish this would go away - it's getting worse. Stop the denial!\n\n***Post 15:***\n\nI'm actually not a psychopath according to the best in the business at psychiatry. I realize I'm cold, completely fucked up, and have a dark and twisted sense of humor. It's years of isolation and trauma that caused it. We've cited countless examples of where I felt empathy.\n\n***Post 16:***\n\nI realize hanging out with me can be disturbing, I have no social skills, am detached from the world. But let's not just to \"psychopath\" conclusion. My diagnosis is Schizoaffective disorder.\n\n***Post 17:***\n\nWe could turn this into the Dr. Phil show and sensationalize me as The Joker based on talking to me for 45 minutes and looking at my posts, but that's not reality.\n\n***Post 18:***\n\nI feel like I'm sick and dying. If the FBI even slightly suspended it's because my mother is poisoning me, trying to murder me, while creating a facade she's trying to help - they'd save me from my sadistic torturer. Remember that my mother loves me and wants me to succeed.\n\n***Post 19:***\n\nWhen I think my mother is putting something like bleach in my food to murder me, remember that I'm 35 years old. If I don't trust her then get independent and make my own food. She's not holding me as a prisoner. My chains are INTERNAL, not maternal. She doesn't want to kill me.\n\n***Post 20:***\n\nMy psychopharmacologist is not my real biological father, and my mother didn't put me through unimaginable Holocaust-level torture for revenge. My mother was not getting sadistic sexual pleasure from attempting to murder me by having my develop a terminal illness. She loves me!\n\n***Post 21:***\n\nI really feel I could be sick and dying - like time could be running out for me. I want to think my parents are imperfect, but didn't do it intentionally. Sadly, it's becoming more apparent to me that my parents were sadistically torturing me and sabotaging my life for pleasure.\n\n***Post 22:***\n\nIt's a hard pill to swallow, even more than the mega regimen of psychiatric medications that my mother FORCED me to take to murder me, realizing she was INTENTIONALLY putting my through Holocaust-level torture for her sadistic sexual pleasure. My chains are maternal, not internal\n\n***Post 23:***\n\nI could literally be dying from terminal illness. I need intervention and freedom RIGHT THIS SECOND. My life is probably ending. It's no delusion or hypochondriasis. My life is probably fucking over and I want to enjoy my remaining time, not Holocaust-level torture for whole life\n\n***Post 24:***\n\nEven if my parents aren't raping and attempting to murder me right this second, they were in the past, and have probably succeeded in killing me. I'll never be able to prove it was intentional sadistic torture. It was. Somebody, give me freedom and independence RIGHT NOW!\n\n***Post 25:***\n\nGod keeps telling me that I'm dying. It'll become dark, tragic, I'll be remembered as a drug-free Syd Barrett or Owen Hart. Their fallen friend.

Her period did not come was already several days late, we had done two pregnancy tests and both resulted negative, but her period still didn't come. I was really worry because even thought I'm currently working and making a good amount of money I'm still not ready neither economically or mentally for being father. Also I knew she was Irregular it was almost two month since her last period and we used same brand tests. So I decided it was better if she take a test where a Doctor. She didn't want it even I explained to her it was only a blood test and we can have the results much earlier because when you wait too long it's harder to act to resolve the problem. We decided to wait one week more and she agreed to do it. But when the day come she struggle to not enter de lab. She began to vary frantically between reason and reason, maybe someone in the laboratory recognized her or that we wait another week. We had already waited a whole month and I had made sure that no one in the lab recognized our data. I told her that we should take this very seriouslly because is something that could ruin our futures. She reluctantly enters and the doctor makes her the test. The results turned out negative and I was obviouslly happy, but she looks upset and after leaving the lab she tells me she wants to break up with me because I put her through something she didn't want. I told her that it was necessary to rule out and to take action as soon as possible to solve the problem if the test was positive because it is something that affects us both.

I was raised by a strong woman to respect women, and I do. I know how even in today's world how hard it must be the be a woman and I've always tried my best to be a supportive respectful friend and boyfriend to the women I've known. I believe in gender equality. I also believe in respecting women's boundries sexually and always have.\r  \n\r  \nYet my whole life, since puberty, I've also fantasized about demeaning women. Verbally degrading them by calling them names. Fucking them rough. Slapping them around, spitting on them. When I get really turned on I almost...I don't even know how to describe it, look down on them? Even though that feels like a massive betrayal of everything I've been raised to believe. I've never acted on any of these urges. Like I said, I've always respected a woman's boundries sexually. I've always felt massively ashamed of these urges and have never told anyone I've known about them.\r  \n\r  \nMy problem is the urges are getting stronger. I've been in relationships with great women who I click with on a personality level, who I respect, yet the sex just bores me. All I could do was fantasize about doing awful things to these women I respected. I've been with enough girls now to know it's not a matter of me not clicking with one or two people, it's something to do with me.\r  \n\r  \nI don't know why I feel this way. I wasn't raised to think about women that way. Sometimes I think I was born in the wrong body. I'm 6'2\", broad shouldered, crazy high sex drive, but I've always been more of a shy, sensitive guy. I'm like a fucking puppy whose feet are too big for him. Sometimes I wish I was just the fucking dumb womanizing jock my hormones seem to want me to be so I wouldn't feel so much inner conflict.\r  \n\r  \nBasically, I'm looking for a woman I can talk to about this. I don't even know where the conversation would go but I just need to talk about this and I can't speak to anyone in my real life about it. Part of me wants someone to talk me into just letting go and accepting this part of me, but part of me is afraid of that. In terms of roleplay, if you'd like to put yourself in the position of me snapping finally and becoming this person, we could do that and we could work to craft our characters and scenario together first, but honestly I just want to talk.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dirtypenpals","subreddit_subscribers":494713,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M4F] Suppressing dark desires, looking for a woman I can share them with","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtypenpals\/comments\/yiu47m\/m4f_suppressing_dark_desires_looking_for_a_woman\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I realized that I was starting to forget what he looked like and starting to forget that we dated. In a way, this is exactly what I want right? But at the same time, it feels like I'm forgetting and will eventually forget a big part of my life. I don't know if I'm happy or sad about this.\n\nIs this a common feeling\/experience?\n---\n**tl;dr**: I'm forgetting my ex existed and it's kinda scaring me and I'm not sure how to feel about this","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationships","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/relationships","subreddit_subscribers":3281765,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I [23M] am forgetting my first relationship with my ex [23M]","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/yiuidx\/i_23m_am_forgetting_my_first_relationship_with_my\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I have never posted on Reddit for relationship advice but I am having a serious dilemma and I literally need stranger's advice, so here we go. For context I am 24\/F and my ex I am talking about is 25\/M.\n\nIn high school I met this boy and we dated for 3 weeks until we had to break up because my parents made us for dumb reasons that they have since recanted. That being said, although my parents made us break up we never lost contact and if anything to us (both 16 at the time) it triggered some Romeo and Juliet complex and we swore we were destined to overcome my parents and be together (dramatic I know but we were young). That was nearly 9 years ago, and in the past 9 years since then, things have gotten far more complicated. In high school after we broke up and in early college, we cheated on all of our significant others with each other &amp; told ourselves it wasn't wrong because we would end up together anyways, I now know it was wrong so pls spare me. Then my senior year of college he said he wanted to actually try to be together (even tho we were at different colleges hundreds of miles apart), either way if he was finally ready to actually try, I was down. This was 2019-2020 and I still felt like a high school girl in love with him. I actually tried but my trust issues were crazy, probably because he cheated on all his girlfriends with me and I am not stupid enough to think i'm \"different\". But what really went wrong is he had a girlfriend at the time and I didn't know, so when I found out I was extremely angry and I told his girlfriend he cheated on her with me. Obviously, this did not go down well between him and I &amp; we ended up blocking each other on everything for the next 2 ish years. \n\nNow we are all caught up to the present, I completed my first year of law school in NYC (we were from TX &amp; that's where he lived) &amp; decided I wanted to transfer back home to finish school, that was a year ago. **I have been dating my current BF for almost a year and a half now**. Now, I am in my last year of law school &amp; I had not seen him since 2019 when I ran into him one night at a bar when my BF was not there. I will talk about my BF really quick as well: he is the best BF I have ever had and I truly love him to death, I think he puts up with a lot more of my BS than he should, he has never really done anything wrong and treats me like a queen, he seriously is great. Anyways, he was not with me the night I ran into my ex &amp; unfortunately my ex and I ended up talking for like 2 hours at the bar, he tried to get me to come with him &amp; his friends to the next bar but I declined &amp; said I did not think it was a good idea. That was nearly 2 months ago, my ex has since moved across the country but will be moving back eventually like in a year. After seeing &amp; talking to him at the bar, we unblocked &amp; refollowed each other on nearly every social media &amp; he has reached out to me on instagram, apologizing for what happened in college &amp; saying he is proud to see how I have been doing in school. \n\nHere is the issue: Him and I have been talking on instagram for the past couple days, just kind of talking about what happened in college &amp; apologizing for all the shit that went down, but then he told me he wanted to call me. I fucked up and agreed because I'm weak and I know that, on the phone he essentially tells me that he still wants to try &amp; he has never been able to stop thinking about me, he has tried but he always comes back to me, ever since 2015. He is also in a relationship now, but he basically said that neither of us are married or have kids yet, and even if we still are not in a good place to try things now, it will only get more complicated in the future. \n\nHere is what I was thinking... To a certain extent he is right because I have had 3 serious boyfriends since him &amp; I have never been able to fully forget about him or get over him. I am being very honest with my feelings here, I do not know what it is about him but I cannot let him go. I am in the best relationship of my life and I STILL think about my HS ex, I feel like it would obviously be wrong to sabotage my current relationship to give my HS ex a chance, but I feel just as bad about suppressing the feelings that I have for my ex and trying to ignore them. My biggest fear is looking back when I am 80 and regretting not giving my ex the chance or looking at my current boyfriend and wishing it was my ex.  I don't know WHY I cannot just GET OVER HIM, I am DYING to but I cannot help my feelings... Part of me thinks it is because we never got the chance to actually date &amp; if we did who knows if it would even be that great, so this is a huge gamble. Please know I am not completely stupid &amp; think that I am \"different\" &amp; he wouldn't cheat on me, I think there would be a lot of trust issues, too. \n\nI feel so bad for even having these thoughts and PLEASE I already feel really awful about entertaining my ex's messages on instagram or talking to him on the phone today, but my main dilemma is that I am in an amazing relationship with a man who treats me like a queen and loves me unconditionally, but I still think about my ex all the time. I know the answer may seem clear cut, but I literally have been trying to get over this ex for nearly 9 years... I feel like I am hiding a dirty secret every time I get into another relationship because I know how I still feel about my ex... It is breaking my heart to think about hurting my current boyfriend, too. I just really do not know what to do &amp; would appreciate any brutal honesty or advice.\n\n**TLDR**: My HS ex that I think I am still in love with wants me to eventually end things with my current boyfriend so we can actually try and date because we cannot get over each other &amp; have not been able to for the past 9 years (u should rly read it tho bc that does not do it justice)\n\nthank y'all :|","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationship_advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0cn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/relationship_advice","subreddit_subscribers":7501024,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"This is a doozy..","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.67,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/yiuohh\/this_is_a_doozy\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

For essentially my whole life, I've had to live with my mother in the middle east. I'm the only American in my family (born in the US), everyone else is middle eastern. I'm living with my Brother right now who has a green card and he has legal guardianship of me, but he's just letting me stay at his place pretty much. He doesn't take care of me financially. My Mother still does, and me staying here is very expensive for her. She wants me to come back to the middle east because it's much cheaper for her. And that's completely valid.\n\nIt is in the middle east however that I have constantly been discriminated against, abused, treated like a stranger, struggled to make friends and fit in- I don't mean for this to sound hateful but I want absolutely nothing to do with that part of the world. I don't like the people there.. And I'm tired of constantly being forced to live in these super negative environments for me. I've developed social anxiety because I'm always so alone there. It's fucked me up and this hasn't been going on for a few months, this has been going on for a decade straight. \n\nI understand it's expensive for my Mother, and I'm trying to get a job here to help cover expenses. My Brother isn't willing to chip in in the slightest, even though he can very well afford it. I'm not entirely sure what his exact reasoning is, other than a few times where he told me \"I don't wanna live with you\". I mean okay, but it's like for less than a year. Can't you just help your little brother? \n\nFor the first time in a very long time, I kinda feel happy for once. Or at least sorta comfortable. I'm opening up again, losing some very weird habits that I picked up, so on. I want it to stay this way, I don't want it to go back, but I'm starting to feel like there may be no choice. I don't wanna put my Mother in a bad spot, but I've been in a terrible one for almost all my life. \n\nI really need some thoughts.\n\nThank you.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AmItheAsshole","subreddit_subscribers":4776509,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA Am I in the wrong for wanting to stay?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.6,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/yiuspx\/aita_am_i_in_the_wrong_for_wanting_to_stay\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I am 22 years old. I live in Murfreesboro which is just right outside Nashville. but currently in Johnson city for college. I am currently a senior in college, and majoring in animation.  Only have 1  class left to take which is awesome, glad to almost be done.  \n\n\n Potential Dealbreakers at the front-\n\n\nI have depression, and Autism.I would like to point out though I do take medicine\/ go to therapy for it so I deal with it well. I know some would rather not deal with that though.  \nI am 5'8 ,  have dark brown medium length hair, glasses stretched ears, and  some facial  hair.  Also I am mixed race ( black and white). I'll send a picture in private if anyone decides to reach out.  \n\n\nOther than that when it comes to me as a person personally I am a quiet and awkward  person if I am going to be honest. It sucks but it is what it is. I am kind, loyal, I love to make people happy and proud.  \n\n\nWith hobbies\/interests, I really enjoy manga\/anime, technology, skateboarding although I cannot do much besides push around, video games, reading, animating, and collecting things. \n\nIt would be cool if you also have some of the same interests so we'd actually have something to talk about. \n\n\nNow onto more of why I am even here  I'd say I'm looking for gentle femdom with a mix of role reversal.  To point out though I actually have never been in any kind of relationship let alone anything kink related, and I think kink etc., is something I have to have in a relationship if that makes sense?. If it did not I am looking for a monogamous relationship with someone that would eventually involve femdom.  I would prefer to get to know you as a person better before doing anything.

Mutual attraction is in fact very important in any relationship so Im happy to provide the same. Doesn't have to be anything special, for all I care you can be wearing 17 winter coats. It's not about getting nudes.\n\n A bit about me. As stated before I'm 23 years old. I've been into kink for 5-6 years now, been actively developing them for pretty much the whole time. I'm into a whole mess of things, from rope play, to spanking, to orgasm control\/denial, to pet play. Now there are a lot of nuances to that. For example I'd like you in a collar and leash, but I don't want you to only speak in barks or something like that. So we can get more into what our kinks mean in dm. Limit wise, it's really just the things that are actually dangerous and unhealthy. Knife play, needles, scat, etc.\n\n Outside kinks I'm pretty average. I live in Minnesota, am not set here for life, but I'm not gonna be moving for a bit. I work, I eat, I sleep. I do play some games, as well as other hobbies like geocaching, watching anime, etc.\n\n I don't think I'm forgetting anything, but again, well have plenty of time to discuss anything else over dms.

I am 23 now. I am living away from home and figured that my habits would be better but they have not. I recently decided to start seeking therapy because I just could not keep going the way that I have been going. I do not do as well as I should in school because of the things that go on inside my head. I am in my last year of college and the issue only continues to get worst and worst. I feel tired all the time, I have no motivation to do many tasks and when I do get some, it takes me much longer than it should take. It feels like a massive internal struggle. Part of me inside knows what I need to do\/ want to do (i.e., clean the house, do the dishes, go to the gym, work ahead on assignments, etc.) but this is an internal struggle I just cannot win. I just cannot force myself to do these things most of the time and I feel bad for not being able to do seemingly simple every day tasks. Sometimes when I wake up it takes me a couple of hours before I finally can get out of bed to go about my day. \n\nI have gotten myself into some situations that have made me mad at myself too. I often times will not talk to my professors when there is something I am struggling with or have something come up that I need to bring to their attention and usually wait until the very last minute to mention something if I even do. I know I am not stupid but because of the emotional neglect I experienced as a child I have always felt that bringing up my concerns were an inconvenience to others and that they would be mad at me for whatever reason or find me annoying or stupid. I know this is not true but this is genuinely something I cannot break myself of thinking. I have self confidence issues from my childhood and from a narcissistic ex girlfriend that cheated on me and really emotionally manipulated me. I lack motivation, second guess everything I do and tend to be passive and stay quiet when issues arise because staying quiet was the only way I learned to avoid ridicule at home because I was always made to feel my feelings were wrong. \n\nThese issues have only gotten worst over the last two years. I lived outside of the country for a year (2019-2020) and returned home and had to live with my parents again because of the start of the covid pandemic. This time away from home was great. I was overseas all that time on a deployment with the military. Honestly, that deployment was the best time of my life so far. For once I didn't feel all the shitty things that I normally felt. I genuinely was happy there even with all the bullshit of Army life. I excelled in PT (Ran at least 20 miles every week between PT and running on my own) and was a very squared away soldier, even winning the battalion Top Gun competition with my crew as I was a gunner on a Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle. I find myself often highly reminiscing. I miss the place, I miss being with my platoon, the people, everything. Since being back home however, I have been on a big downward mental spiral. \n\nI started therapy on Friday and have my next appointment is this Thursday. I am hoping it will help me but I need to desperately get better. I feel so disappointed with myself every day because I know the changes I need to make in my life but I just cannot make myself do them. I feel alone so much even though I know I have friends, some family and a beautiful fiancée to turn to for support. I am taking the steps to get better but was wondering what advice some of you would give me to start making these necessary changes in my life aside from therapy.

During that time we had grown very close to eachother. I was pretty open when it came to sexual things. There had already been a few drunk nights where we made out a bit, but we hadn't had sex and you hadn't seen me naked. I gave you a lot of leniency with intimate things.  To the point where some things became a bit casual. Hugs were normal. And so was some cuddling. A quick kiss as well if you were smart about it. If I annoyed you or messed something up, you would sometimes pull my hair. It was a punishment but also slightly arousing. I might offer to do the dishes for the week in exchange for a good back rub. I was kind of like an unofficial FWB, except less benefits.....for now... \n\nSetup:\nI walked into the living room and saw you sitting on the couch.  I walked up to you and gave you a quick hug. \"Watcha doing?\" I asked, sitting down next to you. \"Just checking my phone\" you said. You put your arm around my shoulder as I snuggled closer. I rested against you. I pulled out my own phone and you gently ran your fingers through my hair as we relaxed. I occasionally giggled when I saw something funny on my feed. You turned you body more towards me, part of me leaning on your chest. \"Get up real quick.\" You said. \"Okay\", I responded, standing up. You repositioned so you were laying on your side. \"Lay here\" you said, patting the area in front on you. I laid back down, and you were now spooning me. One of your arms wrapped around my stomach, and I felt comfortable. After a few minutes, you moved your arm, and it was now cupping my breast over my shirt. I turned my head curiously towards yours. \"I'll do the next load of laundry.\" You offered. \"Alright.\" I said, looking back at my phone, satisfied with the deal. A few minutes after that your hand worked it's way under my shirt. Rubbing my sides a bit before cupping my bra. I looked at you again but instead of saying anything you gave me a quick kiss on the lips. I smiled slightly and didn't say anything about it. \n\n\nThe next steps are up to you. Depending on what you are into, I can either submit or resist a little when you become my Dom. Either way, I want bondage to become a sort of casual thing eventually. Just like how spooning is kinda casual in the setup. Here is 2 examples of what I am imagining. \n\n1. I walked into the apartment and closed the door behind me. As I was facing the door, you suddenly shoved a black ball gag into my mouth and clipped a leash onto my collar. I dropped to my hands and knees as you pulled me into my old bedroom. \n\n2. I was sitting on the couch, watching TV and giggling, when you walked over to me. Your thumb pressed against my lips and my mouth opened. You slid a spider gag in and tightened it before walking away.\n\nI also have a few ideas for the development of the story.\n\n1. After you become my Doma and make me sleep in your room, you turn my old bedroom into a bondage room while I am out. Like anchors in the walls and ceiling, and a special bedframe along with anything else you want\n\n2. If you have actually read everything up to here, ask me what color my nails are in your first message. \n\n\nWe can tweak and alter bits of this scenario in chat. There are also a few minor ideas I can tell you if you are interested.\n\n Now onto me!\n\nI'm Elena, and I'm currently 21. I'm 5'6 with DD breasts and long brown hair. I'm looking for a guy in the same age range (20-25).\n\nWe can go into more detail about kinks and limits in dms. But I mostly like light bondage, collars, some petplay, outfit control, romance, training, and other stuff.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dirtypenpals","subreddit_subscribers":494713,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"F4M Dominating your roommate","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtypenpals\/comments\/yiv2z3\/f4m_dominating_your_roommate\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I  want to try and change that though! I enjoy meeting new people and  learning about their interests and things they love and feel strongly  about or things that drive them crazy. I am not really looking for  anything specific but I will attach a little bit about myself and if it  seems cool then send me a message :)\n\nA  little bit about myself, I am 25M currently living in Columbus, Ohio. I  am 5'10, 175lbs. I am working on getting my bachelors degree currently  and hopefully will have that finished soon. I am getting it in computer  science and graphic design. I have a gray and white cat appropriately  named Gandalf who I adore very much even though he can be quite an  asshole at times. I have some pretty bad anxiety but I am trying to work  on getting out of my comfort zone and trying to better myself overall. I  love the winter more than the summer, I can't stand being hot. I love  music and most genres of music. I have been trying to discover more and  more music as of late and it has been quite enjoyable. My favorite genre  is definitely rock though with my favorite band being Guns N Roses. I  like to play video games and spend a good chunk of my free time playing  them with my friends, it is kind of my comfort in a way. I have also  been wanting to get into model building and I purchased one and did that  recently and it was pretty fun and relaxing so that might be a new  hobby I pick up as well.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"r4r","subreddit_id":"t5_2rn0e","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/r4r","subreddit_subscribers":552149,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"25[M4F] Midwest\/Anywhere - Looking for anything :)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/r4r\/comments\/yiv305\/25m4f_midwestanywhere_looking_for_anything\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}
