The score is good for 5 years.\n\nI'm planning on studying for the GMAT this year and hope that I can get into a top 10 MBA school.\n\nHowever, my undergraduate GPA was only a 3.2.\n\nMost of the incoming students at top 10 have really high GPAs.

Right now, my best option is to go for an MBA and hopefully ease my way into the executive side.  \n\nI would like to do a JD/MBA if possible.  For starters, I did well on the LSAT.  Score could have been better, but I work almost 10-12 hours a day and studied 2 hours a day for 3 months.  I took PTs on the weekends and crammed 3-4 PTs every weekend.  I also have saved up close to $80k for the JD.  My employer has agreed to fund my MBA but I have not yet told them about my JD plans.  Most likely, they will not fund it.  \n\nSo... if I score a 750+ on the GMAT, do I have a chance at getting in at a Top 10?  With my LSAT and GPA, I have a decent shot at a splitter friendly school like Northwestern.  It is rank 12 for Law, but 5th for MBA.  I don't think I have a shot at Stanford, but I'm going to apply anyway because YOLO.  Stressing out right now... GMAT LR seems way easier than LSAT LR so that's good... jeez...

And never has a game affected me so much, so I thought I would share my experience.\n\nI have played through both ME2 &amp; ME3 twice each before, not back to back, admittedly, and 18 months ago now, so the emotional impact it has had on me is totally unexpected.  Finished ME3 again three days ago &amp; I can't get it out of my head - what a series!  Maybe because I played back to back, with the new DLC experiences, that its left such an impact.  After 70 hours &amp; 3-4 weeks of fairly solid gameplay (unfortunately I have to earn a salary) theres no doubt you become emotionally involved with all the characters.  You have invested time in them and you begin to care for these guys.  They mean a lot to you. That, I guess, is what makes Mass Effect stand out so much.\n\nBut the main reason I think it made such an impression is because of one Dr Liara T'Soni.  I had romanced her in ME1 but then moved onto Jack, Tali &amp; Miranda in my first play throughs of ME2.  On ME3 I just continued these romances. But this time I decided it was the blue goddess all the way - plus I had LotSB to look forward to.\n\nMy god that Asari got under my skin.  From LotSB, where you find out the lengths she will go for HER Shepherd (and he will always be HER Shepherd in my eyes), to the heart-wrenching moments at the conclusion of ME3 your heart just melts for her.  Is it her naivety?  Or geekiness?  Her vulnerability? Her deep attachment to Shepherd?  Or is it just those blue eyes &amp; freckles?  I guess a combination of all.\n\nBut whatever it is the incredibly touching scenes at the end of ME3 just broke me.  I mean BROKE ME.  We are talking tears here.  From the touching moments in the Citadel DLC party mission (\"I love watching you sleep....\"), the mind-melding 'gift' for Shepherd before the last attack (\"I love you\"), the heart-breaking goodbye as she is whisked off in the Normandy after being injured but is just unable to get her last words to Shepherd out (\"I will always love you\"), to the gut-wrenching plaque ceremony on the Normandy.  Your heart goes out to her.  She must be bereft.  HER Shepherd has been taken from her.  Not just her friend, her captain or her lover but her bond-mate, her soul-mate, her inspiration.  The lack of closure kills me &amp; I can't stop thinking about it.\n\nWhat the hell is wrong with me?  I'm 35 years old.  I am in a happy, loving relationship.  Why the hell am I grieving so much for a fictional alien?  I have never had a crush on a video game character before but this is a definite first.  \n\nKeep your love true &amp; blue, people\n\n \n","media":null,"ups":87,"retrieved_on":1441891060,"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1393633802","subreddit":"masseffect","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.masseffect","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"True blue love for Liara"}

I left college about 2 years ago after one complete year due to money issues and issues with anxiety and now I can't force myself to go back. I can't decide on what I should major in as my original major, chemistry, doesn't seem appealing anymore. I don't have many other interests aside from music and video games but I'm not good at writing (despite having been playing guitar for over 8 years) and designing video games is beyond my scope of ambition. I don't feel like I'm good at anything. I haven't gone to a single class this semester (I hate my community college and I've been having anxiety attacks as well as a 2 month long battle with depression) and so I need to withdraw to avoid failing out but that involves me going to the school and getting instructor signatures which I don't want to do. In dropping out I also enter repayment for my loans that I had taken out for my time at my other college.\nI'm going back to school in the fall and I have no idea what to do. I don't want to live with other people but I know I'll have to. I need to complete my financial aid but my parents are holding that up so I'm worried I won't get anything which means I won't be able to afford anything. I'm worried that I won't be able to make enough money to survive no matter what I do and I hate that I feel forced into a life style I don't agree with (working all the time just to get by). I hate my current job but I make too much (not really all that much but more than anyone else would be willing to pay me) and I don't have the experience to do much else.\nMy girlfriend of 5 years and I have been fighting a lot lately and things almost ended a few days ago. I'm still uncertain as to what is happening there. I love her and care about her but we drive each other crazy often and we share very few interests. If something were to happen I don't think I could find another person and therefore I'd be alone. I worry that we both stay out of comfort and the knowledge that the known is far less frightening than the unknown.\nI've been avoiding calling my doctor as well as a therapist because I don't want to confront things they may be wrong with me but I really need to. My parents deny that anything could be wrong with me while admitting a family history and saying that they feel something may be wrong with my siblings mental health.\nLife feels like it's moving to fast and every decision feels like it needs to be made immediately but then I just fuck myself over by being to hasty. Some days I have trouble sleeping because my mind is racing. Other days I'm in pain because I get really stressed out. Everything keeps piling up, toppling over, and then piling up again and I just want things to stop. I don't have many friends, I don't trust other people, I can't talk to my family, and I don't want to burden my girlfriend any further. I'm lost and I don't know what to do.

As it was addressed to both, had the National Health Service logo on the envelope, and I'm an only child, I correctly assumed that it concerned me, and opened it. The letter was something about support groups for parents with autistic kids. I remember breaking down into tears, then having a row with my mother about an hour later when she came back from work. I assumed, since I have the mental capacity to type this post, that it was Asperger's. The diagnosis proved to be correct, because I can now barely say a sentence to anyone without tripping over my words at least twice, I cannot make friends nor maintain existing ones, and I always seem to be the last to get a joke. \n\nBefore a couple of weeks ago I thought my depression was just regular depression, then I realised that my occasional phases of being more talkative, having extraordinary ideas and trying to see them them through, and generally having more physical energy were more than likely hypomania. Fortunately, I haven't severely indebted myself or anything yet, but I'm really scared of what I might end up doing if my depression and/or mania keep on escalating. The obvious thing to do would be to get medication, but I really don't need my mum finding out. In theory I could get it from the NHS, but I'm not 'of age' yet, so there's a possibility that it could tell her, and I'd be in an even worse situation than I am already. I'd feel like the moment I walked through those doors, it would be all or nothing. The only other option would be to wait until I'm 18... gaaaaaaahhh... I don't know what to do.","media":null}

'I'm your friend too aren't I? Doesn't mean enough?'\nWe went on a vacation a couple weeks ago and when we got back she told me that I needed to catch up on all my assignments. So I did completely within that week. A week later she's still using te excuse 'you need to catch up on everything' to keep me from going on. I asked permission if I could go to the mall tomorrow with some friends and she said no. I asked why. She said 'You went on a vacation last week you don't need to spend time with your friends.' Then she proceeded to talk over me and scold me for fooling around at school apparently because my brother saw me rough housing with friends in the hall way. Apparently to her I'm supposed to use my lunch period for more studying and if she hears from my brother that I'm goofing off then I'm grounded. It's honestly to the point I think she doesn't even care about my grades, they're just something she can hold over me and punish me with. She sees how when she pushes me and my anxiety grows and my grades drop but she doesn't care. She says I have to learn how to handle it. \nI also remember when I was like nine and she got into a small accident pulling out of our neighbourhood. She was completely alone in the car and clipped a tree or something. She was completely fine and so was the car but the first thing she said to me was 'I could have died today because of you. I was too busy worried about how awful you're misbehaving and nearly crashed. How would you have felt if I died and it was your fault?'  All this pertaining to how I had failed a passed math test. I honestly don't know how to deal with her emotional shit along with an abusive father. It's getting to be way too much.

I've been having trouble sleeping, haven't been as hungry, and have had a really hard time focussing on school work. I want her back, but I don't want to ruin anything after she's made her stance so clear. I love her, but there are moments when I can't look at her because the heartache is too much. I really just don't know what to do because I don't feel like I'm making progress. I've tried writing stuff down, playing music (been playing the piano for 13 years &lt;3), etc. to express myself. This is probably all typical breakup, heartbreak stuff, but I don't know because I've never done this before. I'd never been in love or even had a crush before.

I'll start by saying my SO and I have been dating for a year and a half, and as ridiculous as \"omg I'm 20 and I know who I'm going to be with 4eva\" lines are, I feel very confident in our relationship, and she does too. Our relationship goes through its rocky points from our history, but we both are at a comfortable place with each other in terms of our history.\n\nWhat I'm not comfortable with comes in my relationship with him. He and I were insanely close through school, so much so we got the obligatory \"haha they must be gay\" jokes. Yeah, conservative, upper middle class area. Anyway, he was pretty introverted and private even with me, also very introverted. He was also influenced by \"bro-y culture,\" which I am quite repulsed by. He dated my SO when they were 17 for about 3 months, and I didn't know much about it (we had begun to very slowly drift apart recently before this, primarily because of \"bro culture\"). He died in a car accident a few months later, I was obviously sad for quite a while. Got a tattoo, moved on. Once I started dating my SO almost a year after his death, we began breaching some issues related to him. He was fairly forward with her (understandable, she is someone who takes a lot to be brought out of her shell), but also did this sexually several times, and with no conversation or consent about the topic. She wasn't forcibly raped or anything like that, but she was not comfortable with the sexual conduct and was too shy to say \"no.\" He broke up with her, very likely linked with her desire to \"not go further\" sexually, and this has left her with a lot of unresolved feelings.\n\nUltimately, I'm not totally sure what advice I'm asking for. In a lot of ways, I feel very little positive emotion for him anymore, and instead think of him as the guy who was inconsiderate and violated my SO. I obviously have great memories of him, and strongly associate some of the deepest loves in my life with him (music, philosophy, basketball, etc.), but I don't know how to feel when my first thought of him now is the hurt he's done rather than the positive. It's even at a point where most other people, including my SO, tend to remember him more positively than I do. I have talked to her about this, too. I'm not as eloquent in real time as I can be over text, but she gets very locked up by her (generally unnecessary) guilt, so it's tough to talk to her about my relationship with him independent of her. Thanks for listening, just writing this has helped. :)\n\n**TL;DR** Best friend dated my current SO while in high school.

Also our relation has taken turned apart from each other as oyr choices do not line up. I feel disrespected as a woman mostly, still seen as a child.

Yet i do not see that in my partner. Back to me, for a few years now I do not get turned on at all. I mean nothing. I have tried many things over the years, toys with us, breathing techniques, specific hypnosis, treated for energy blocks and still no release with my partner.   ...... on the other side solo I am good, I can please myself within minutes even even ejaculations and sometimes several.  . But I am tired and sick if this over wore route.   .... at this point I have given up on sex, we have had intercourse in a month and do not even want it.

I was 24 years old, obese, depressed, unemployed, socially retarded, cynical, single, sexually frustrated, unhealthy, etc. I managed to pull myself and get my into grad school and started working on myself around last August. I have achieved lots of progress, but I am still single and feeling sad about it.\n\nSo here is what I have achieved so far: I started seeing a therapist and got my depression under control (and for the first time in my life I am not feeling terrible 24/7, and am actually happy or neutral most of the time). I dug deep into all my suppressed painful memories and faced many hard truths that I have been avoiding (that my family was dysfunctional, that I have been abused as a child, that I lack social skills, ...). I was obsessed with external validation, especially that of women, but now I derive value out of myself through achieving progress and competing against **me**. I am now caring less and less about other people's opinion in me, and starting to care about the quality of my interactions with them instead of diong what it takes to be liked. I now perceive people (women included) as a complement to my life; I do not need them to *complete* me. I have been reading on social skills and body language and been changing all the bad habits I picked growing up. I was obsessed with picking up girls from bars (and failing miserably) but now I do not see that as a goal to pursue in itself and just try to enjoy my time (and last time I went to a bar, two weeks ago, I was approached by two *very* willing girls, one of them very hot, that never happened to me before). I started taking care of my body, and now I exercise religiously and only eat clean food I cook. I am now the healthiest and fittest I have ever been. I started reading on fashion and buying clothes for myself for the first time ever in my life, and am starting to look like a decent human being. Last Monday I received lots of complements (and looks) on my outfit. I also changed my mindset: I am doing all of this because it makes me happy; positive feedback from other people is just a nice byproduct. The top priority on my list is becoming the man I want to be when I am 30 years old (as a preparation for becoming the man I want to be when I am 40, and then 50, and so on).\n\nBut I still have no woman in my life, and I still feel like I am missing something. (Though it does not make me miserable as it used to do in the past.)\n\nA year ago I was able to get 0 dates; now I I get first dates where I increasinly enjoy myself (and I can see that the women do as well, as I learn more and more about body language and social cues and so on), but no second dates. Rejection used to send me into deep episodes of depression, but now I am growing less sensitized to it.\n\nI used to interpret rejection as a direct result of me being inherintly bad; but now I see it as just a result of incompatability, time not being right, and/or me not being the man quality women see as a mate--yet. I do not have any expectations when it comes to finding love as I progress: That is, I do not expect to be a ladies man or anything at the \"end\" of my journey, but that won't stop me from working on myself because I will be happier than I am right now regardless of my future status.\n\nI am always told that I have to wait to stumble across the one. I also know my logical fallacies very well to realize that this is nothing but wishful thinking.\n\nI don't know, /r/askseddit.

My boyfriend and I are having a little problem, and I would be so grateful for any help you could give!\n\n(Quick background: he's 25, I'm 23, been together for three years and poly for all of them.)\n\nWe just moved to a new city, and my hubby has been especially eager to meet new, like-minded people, so we've signed up for a few poly groups on Meetup. One kind of the many events offered are play parties.\n\nIt was my boyfriend's idea to go to one of the parties, a few weeks from now. I want to go, too, but I have some reservations. I just started a new job, money's tight and I'm really stressed out. (Plus, a guy that I was seeing before my primary joined me up here just stopped responding to my texts, and that hurt a lot.) I'm generally a bit insecure all the time, but after all of this in rapid succession, my insecurities are raging big time.\n\n I've wanted to go to a play party for some time, just to see if it would be something I'm into. However, because I'm feeling so damn insecure, I can't help but worry about the party. My boyfriend is much more attractive than I am, and, I'm finding, more uninhibited. Like, I'm afraid he's going to meet someone else who's skinnier, prettier, more uninhibited and better than me, get swept away and just ignore me and go off with that person. Meanwhile, no one will want to talk to me or play with me, I fear, and I'll just sit and think about how he's not here, he didn't want to be with me, he wanted some other person more. \n\nMy bf and I have had multiple conversations about this, and he and I have agreed to ground rules, including my being able to pull him at any time from any sort of activity if I'm feeling uncomfortable, and not going all the way with anyone (the same would apply to me as well). He also said that we can stay with each other the whole time. I took this last statement to mean that we would stick together, just play together and just talk with other people. What he ACTUALLY meant was that we could stick together WHILE I play/he plays with other people.\n\nThis clarification triggered my insecurities. I love when my bf goes out with other people. I feel a high degree of compersion for him... But those are dates away from home. I'm not sure if I could handle seeing him with another person, at least not right now. I don't know for sure that I'll get upset, but I'm just afraid I will. \n\nWhen I asked that we just go and stick together and NOT play with anyone just the first time, he got upset and refused. Admission to the party costs money, and he says if we're just going to talk and not participate in the play, he can do that for free. He suggested we not go at all, then, and conveyed his disappointment. I also said I wasn't sure if I was comfortable if he went by himself, and I'm way too shy to go by myself.\n\nMy bf has done everything he can to try and. assuage my insecurities and issues, but I can't shake it and I feel horrible. I don't want to be the asshole who thinks they can handle the kink and then freaks out when they actually get there because they don't know their limits. (YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE KINK!) I'm just petrified of being left in the dust and being eaten alive by my insecurities. But my insecurities are already eating me alive. And my awareness of my boyfriend's disappointment and irritation with my constantly going back-and-forth, weighing the options, is acute and extremely painful. \n\nI DON'T want to be a downer girlfriend (although I won't be afraid to do that if that's what I feel I need to do). I DON'T want to be ruled by my insecurities. And I DO want to go to the party, really I do. \n\nMy ultimate questions: am I being a bad girlfriend/poly person? Is my proposed compromise unreasonable? Or should I just stay away from the thing entirely (which I don't want to do)? Suggestions for things that would help me feel not as insecure at the party if we do? \n\nTl;dr- play party anxiety.","retrieved_on":1441890970,"ups":16,"permalink":"/r/polyamory/comments/1z8btd/play_party_woes/","link_flair_text":null,"author":"thatcurvychick","from":null,"is_self":true,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"num_comments":17,"author_flair_css_class":null,"id":"1z8btd","archived":true,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_1z8btd","gilded":0,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":16,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1z8btd/play_party_woes/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qu5n","created":1393638879,"from_kind":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false}

I'm only on day number 6 on my MyFitnessPal streak. I decided this time, I wasn't going to tell everyone about my Hottie goals. I also wasn't going to shove a shitload of fries in my mouth hiding in the kitchen as I was fixing dinner for my hubs this time. [You know... if no one saw it, you didn't really eat it, right?]\n\nWell, I've stuck to 1400 calories per day this week. I should have probably been at 1200, but I'm not Super Woman, okay? I've been getting out of the house every day which is something for me, as I'm a stay at home mom &amp; dislike most people this time of year.

Yes, but Walmart is a huge store with tons of steps to the clearance aisle.\n\n\nAnyway, what you're really here for: My starting weight this time was 170. I'm 5'3. This wasn't good.

I visit this subreddit a lot and know that it's a really supportive place, and right now I just want to burst into tears and could just use some kind words. I'm 5'4\", and I used to weigh about 175lbs. I never considered myself overweight, mainly because I did sports all throughout high school and really just viewed myself as an athlete. Whenever I'd gain weight, I just thought, psht, it's all muscle. My mom has anorexia nervosa, and since eating disorders are thought to be at least partially genetic, she always tried reinforcing body confidence in  me and I never felt like I was ever \"fat\" in my life. We also never had a scale in our house, but I knew I was around 175ish lbs because whenever I'd go to a friend's house and see one of their bathroom scales I'd step on it just out of curiosity. I knew I was bigger than some people who were my height, but not that I was out of a normal range for body weight. Then I found the subreddit r/progresspics, where people post \"before\" and \"after\" pictures, usually involving weight loss or muscle gain. Don't get me wrong, it's a great subreddit! But I started seeing people of the same height as me whose \"before\" weights were less than my current weight, and whose \"after\" weights were about 60lbs less than mine. I took a good look in the mirror and decided it was time to lose a few pounds. I got a weight loss app, made sure to eat a certain amount of calories per day, and started exercising more. It started out really great! I felt super healthy and more energized. I gradually started losing weight and bought a scale so I could keep track of it. Every time I saw the number go down, it was a great boost of confidence. It was addicting. I started workinb so hard to lose the weight, and if I ever \"lost control\", as I considered it, I would exercise to compensate for it. This started in June 2013, when I was 175lbs. When I had to leave for school, things got bad. I was taking really hard classes and seriously missing my boyfriend/best friend. I started stress eating and exercising excessively to compensate. Then one day, things got really bad and I ate an entire box of cereal in one setting. I looked at the calories, and I realized that I had essentially consumed about 2,000 calories in one sitting. Panicking, I ran to the bathroom and threw it all up and felt relieved that the food was gone. This sort of thing started happening more and more frequently. Essentially, I became obsessed with losing weight and managed to work myself into bulimia. I started becoming depressed and started socially withdrawing. I didn't realize it was depression--I just was very tired all the time and everything felt useless. My friends thought I didn't like them (with good reason--I just altogether stopped hanging out with them because social interaction was too much) and I really just crawled into myself. At some point, I realized that I needed help, but at the same time, I didn't think it was bad enough for me to get help. I thought that the therapist would think I was faking for attention. You don't have an eating disorder if you're not emaciated, right? And you don't have depression unless you're suicidal, right? (Of course I know now that this is very wrong.) So I tried to help myself because I was too embarrassed to get help anywhere else. I started branching out, trying to make new friends. I thought that if I could just make some friends, maybe I'd find people that liked me so that I might stop hating myself. I'm currently pledging a co-ed fraternity and have met a lot of wonderful people as a result. Since then, my confidence has gotten better and my eating has been, too. I rarely purge anymore. I still am eating less than I'm supposed to, and it's on purpose, but I like to think that I'm making progress. Anyway, today I was hanging out with some of the pledges, and the subject of weight loss came up. I'm currently 135lbs, and some crazy thought came into my head that I should show them a picture of my \"before\". Well, they laughed it. They straight up LAUGHED at it. One told me that I looked like a soccer ball. They told me, \"don't worry, you don't look like that now\" etc etc. Do you know how much that hurt to hear? Did people always think I looked like that? So heavy that it warranted actual laughter?! I thought I was making such great progress, but my confidence is shattered. Now I'm terrified that I'll eat too much and become the laughable soccer ball. I went to dinner, stress-ate two servings of dinner and dessert, and purged it all. I feel so shitty right now. I really don't know what I expect anyone to say, but my heart just hurts so much right now. Has anyone had anything similar happen? I just really feel like I need a hug and I feel really alone. \n\nTL;DR: Tried losing weight, got an eating disorder, friends saw pics of me from before my weight loss and told me I looked like a soccer ball.","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1441890954,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1z8cya/friends_saw_a_picture_of_me_from_before_my_eating/","from":null,"author":"[deleted]","is_self":true,"num_comments":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"name":"t3_1z8cya","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"id":"1z8cya","archived":true,"edited":false,"score":0,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1z8cya/friends_saw_a_picture_of_me_from_before_my_eating/","from_kind":null,"created":1393639688,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r2jt","stickied":false}

It was a sudden, quick, and relatively painless breakup. She had just woken up one morning and was no longer in love with me. But I still love her. She's literally the only person I've felt anything for, and while we were together, I was truly in love. So here we are two months later, we're still good friends and I see her at school everyday. She knows I still love her and has been really kind to me over the past few weeks.\nI've been trying to get over her and move on for the last two months, and I've felt like I've made progress, but recently it's felt like I'm back at square one. She's made it quite clear that she doesn't want to be more than friends anymore, but she's also said she still cares about me. We're friends and it's ok. I'd much prefer this to not being friends with her at all. We still text too. But the truth is, every second is painful. I can't stop thinking about her. I've been having trouble sleeping, haven't been as hungry, and have had a really hard time focussing on school work. I want her back, but I don't want to ruin anything after she's made her stance so clear. I love her, but there are moments when I can't look at her because the heartache is too much. I really just don't know what to do because I don't feel like I'm making progress. I've tried writing stuff down, playing music (been playing the piano for 13 years &lt;3), etc. to express myself. This is probably all typical breakup, heartbreak stuff, but I don't know because I've never done this before. I'd never been in love or even had a crush before. I don't know what I really can do besides just march on. Reading through this subreddit has made me feel grateful, at least, that the break up went rather smoothly, so there's that. Because she had my heart and she didn't stomp on it. She kinda just handed it back to me and took a few steps back. Any words of encouragement or advice are welcome.

First, I hope you'll forgive me if this is a weird post. I have pictures, and if taking selfies of your mouth isn't weird, then I guess I don't know weird.\n\nFirst, my background. I'm 38, and I have been a smoker for 20 years. Trying to change that and, like many other aspects of my life, failing miserably at that. Up until about four years ago, I had not been to the dentist in years. I started going regularly, and the hygienist told me I was in bad shape, but not beyond repair if I took care of myself. She did the root planing and scaling, cleanings every three months, and she said there was a marked improvement. I have impacted wisdom teeth, but the dentist did not seem too concerned as they were not causing me problems. Then, I stopped going.\n\nFast forward to today, and I am in unbelievable pain. The right side of my jaw radiates pain, all the way forward to the front, and up into my sinus cavity. It's worst on the bottom. Headaches that don't stop. There is a tightness in my chest that I attribute to anxiety from the pain. And just now, while rubbing my jaw, I notice a bulge or swelling on the right side. Not sure how long it has been there. I called today to get an appointment for Monday morning. It sucks that I have to go through the weekend like this. I've gone through a half tube of Orajel and am taking way too much Ibuprofen.\n\n[Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/cQfZM)\n\nSo there is my mouth. I'm not even educated in dentistry, and I can tell it looks like hell. Just from the pictures, what can you tell me? I know I have a cavity on my back right molar, but hopefully he doesn't have to do a root canal like he did on the one in front of it. $$$$!!! That tooth even wiggles slightly. The wisdom teeth obviously have not erupted. Could they be causing problems?\n\nOn the top, I'm assuming those are wisdom teeth at the back, with whatever those grey spots are, but I'm not sure. My gums look awful, and my teeth look like they could just pop out.\n\nI know I need to start taking this seriously, even if it's already too late. I'm sure they will recommend another root planing, but would the LPT be a better option? I'm sure it's much more expensive than a simple root planing, but is it worth the expense?\n\nI'm rambling, and I'm sorry. Thanks in advance for any advice you can provide.","media":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_1z8hl5","gilded":0,"archived":true,"id":"1z8hl5","num_comments":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"[deleted]","stickied":false,"from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rpgi","from_kind":null,"created":1393643097,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/1z8hl5/my_mouth_is_a_wreck_and_i_need_some_unvarnished/","secure_media":null,"edited":false,"score":9,"quarantine":false}

Basically, I'm trying to find a good route for finding a career in aviation. Currently, I hold a private pilot's license with an instrument add on with 320 hours total time. I'm 26 and recently decided that instead of flying for fun, I'd like to try  making a living out of it somehow. Flying for an airline sounds like a ton of fun, but honestly I have no idea whats out there. I don't have any family or friends that fly, so its kind of hard to figure out what to expect. Plus, I don't have any connections.\n\nUntil now, I have been flying under part 61 with a private instructor, but back in January, I started flying at a part 141 school with the intent of eventually obtaining a restricted ATP. However, I'm finding their syllabus to be very rigid as it's designed for people with little to no experience.  I'm required to redo a lot of the training that I have already completed in order to meet the141 eligibility needed for the ATP. On top of having to meet their daily lesson requirements, we only get about an hour flight time per lesson and due to weather and other obstacles, I'm averaging about 12 hours a month. So in other words, things are moving at a snail's pace compared to what I'm used to and I'm not really advancing as quickly as I would like. Plus, I feel like I'm wasting too much time refreshing over this old material and foresee possibly being rushed when it finally comes time for the new material. So I'm wondering if going back to the flexibility of part 61 with the private instructor is the right move considering how much quicker I should  be able to blow through the hour requirements. Obviously, I wouldn't be eligible for the restricted ATP, but I'm thinking that perhaps I could pick up that last 500 hours quick enough so that it may not be worth pursuing. \n\nEven though I'm not really sure what employers are looking for, I'm worried that this route might make me a weaker candidate when looking for a job as it would seem holding an aviation degree and a 141 certificate looks better than just holding a certificate obtained privately. Not to mention there would be fewer chances to network as this school provides interview opportunities that I would no longer have. \n\nAnother obstacle is getting my hands on  a multi-engine trainer. I'm  considering sticking around school until I get the multi and then leaving to work on the commercial and up on my own.\n\nEven though being an airline pilot would fulfill  my ultimate fantasy, I could definitely see myself being happy as long as I could find a job that paid the bills. I'm willing to travel and do whatever it takes to get there, but I need a plan.\n\nAnyway, I know this is kind of long and drawn out, but any advice on some of these issues would be greatly appreciated. Maybe there's a better school out there for someone in my shoes.\n","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/flying/comments/1z8i4u/student_pilot_here_looking_for_some_advice/"}

I honestly considered lying about my age and saying that I'm 20 in order to avoid being shamed for my decisions, but I figured that, if I want honest advice, I should present honest facts. Please, I know that many of you would feel the need to scold me for my lack of both experience and wisdom, but I have made these decisions and nothing can change the past. I'm willing to listen to any advice on what I should do in the future, but for now, I'd appreciate it if hostility could be left out of your criticism, thank you.\n\n\n\nI'm a first year university student experiencing the adult world for the first time. I suppose you could say I've \"blossomed\" after some extremely awkward high school years and more people seem to be quick to call me attractive. I'm physically disabled (cerebral palsy) so my self-confidence has never been the highest, and this new praise was exciting. My romantic past, however, has been borderline abusive. Thankfully, the one serious relationship that I've had--which occurred in my senior year of high school--was non-abusive, just abnormal. \n\n\nMy boyfriend at that time had an attachment disorder as well as major social anxiety. I was not allowed to be public about any aspect of the relationship or display affection publicly. In private, we were fine and it lasted a long time, but fell apart when the seriousness became too much for him (we had gotten into sending nude pics, which pleased him, but his past made him uncomfortable with sexual commitment and I broke things off because I could see his mental health had been suffering at the concept of intimacy to the point where slowing down fixed nothing.)\n\nBefore him, I had a classmate sexually harass me and my mother verbally abuse me for my appearance. I do present a need to please others and an inability to be assertive now, and I discuss these issues with a therapist, but right now, I'm in a situation that I need multiple opinions on.\n\n\nI made an online dating profile as a joke for some drunken friends. I live in a small town and it seemed ridiculous, but after I got some replies, I edited it seriously and set up a date with a very forward guy who had moved to my town for post-secondary and didn't have a single friend. He seemed just as lonely as me, but what struck me as odd was he requested that I meet him in his apartment. Red flag. I declined and asked to meet him in public, which we did and he turned out to be really thoughtful and sweet, no rapist vibes, he just seemed semi-socially-inept--like me. (I don't even think he realized that asking me to go to his apartment was creepy.)\n\n\nHe and I shared a lot of similar interests, though he wasn't a good conversationalist. I noticed that he didn't ask me many questions about myself, only responded to questions I asked about him. He seemed to be waiting for me to present him with information about myself, and when I did that, he would give normal, average commentary. No red flags, just good dinner conversation. I shrugged off his lack of questions because I thought perhaps my profile had told him enough.\n\n\nLater that week, I did visit his apartment. He asked me if I would be okay cuddling and I said yes. We cuddled while playing video games and he started getting touchy-feely. I told him I wouldn't remove any clothes but I was fine with what he was currently doing. He clued in that I'm a virgin and understood. I suppose university students do tend to move things quickly, but I wanted to go slow. By the end of the night, my bra had been removed and we had cuddled topless, something I hadn't done in my last relationship, which lasted for a long time and was very emotionally intimate. Still, I didn't feel shame, guilt, or discomfort. I was just thrilled that *for once in my life* somebody wasn't rejecting my body. I felt like I had been given approval.\n\n\nAll last week, I walked to his apartment from school. He's been extremely thoughtful by downloading video games that I mention in our conversations, finding netflix shows he thinks would interest me, etc. He even helps me with walking and getting my shoes on when my muscles don't want to work. I told him I wanted our romantic interactions to progress slower than they had during my previous visit and he was very respectful. \nHe said, \"No problem, I don't want you to do anything you're uncomfortable with. I just want you to have fun, though. I want to show you that you can relax here and trust me.\"\n\n\nLater, he asked me if it would still be okay to cuddle together naked or semi-naked. I figured that, since he had already seen my breasts once, it would be silly to pretend it hadn't happened. I allowed the cuddling, but I told him my pants were staying on. \n\nWe were making out and he started fiddling with my belt. I froze because, as I mentioned, I have a problem with being assertive. I managed to say \"h-hey, what did I tell you about my pants, mister?\" ,trying not to be too serious. He claimed that the clasp on my jeans was tricky and he just wanted to see if it could \"beat\" it because its difficulty had begun to bug him. I figured that having him unbutton the jeans was fine. I was obviously on my period and I hadn't shaved my pubic region in awhile. I didn't think he'd be too interested in anything down there. \n\n\n...Then he proved me wrong. Turns out, I really enjoy anal play. A lot. I got so into it, my pants were removed without me noticing. After it was over, I didn't feel any discomfort or guilt, but I playfully said \"what happened to not doing anything I'm uncomfortable with, hmmmm?\"\nhe replied, \"You seemed QUITE comfortable, cutie. I said I wouldn't do anything you didn't want me to do, I never said I wouldn't persuade you into wanting more.\"\nI laughed it off. I'm not a purist. I don't believe in all the dated stigmas about chastity and women. I wasn't hurt and everything we had done was all in good fun. I just told myself I would limit it to hand action and that I wouldn't allow us to do anything involving our genitals.\n\n\n...Then the next time I went over we had anal sex. I considered asking him to stop as soon as he went inside, but I was curious and honestly didn't care either way. It was fun.\n\n\nThe thing is, I have clinical depression and I've been taking anti-depressants for over a month now. I haven't really cared about my well-being at all lately. There's a rational voice inside my head saying \"you used to be in love with somebody and nothing sexual ever happened in that relationship. You've known this guy for a week and you aren't in a relationship at all! What are you doing?! This isn't you! You're the innocent, good girl!\"\n\n\nAnd it's true. I've always been that shy girl who didn't associate with drugs and only experimented with alcohol once or twice. I don't understand why I keep letting this advance. It's not that I don't want it to escalate, but the same time, I don't *WANT* it to either. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm indifferent. I don't care what happens either way.\n\n\nBut he gets so clingy. He wants me to come over everyday and texts me always wanting to know when I'm free. As somebody who never received much positive attention until lately, this feels good. However, he's made statements such as \"relationships only complicate things. Maybe we'll do that someday, but I think sex is not the same thing as love and it's just something that can be done for fun. It's good for confidence! I want to show you how great you can be!\"\n\n Ever since the second day I've gone over to his apartment, he's wanted me to stay the night. He says even if I sleep in a different bed, it'll be nice not to fall asleep alone and wake up alone. I feel for him. He's been living in a new place for a long time, didn't have many friends back where he used to live, can't seem to make any new friends besides me, and must be very lonely. I'm just worried he's settling for me because I'm the only person talking to him. \n\n\nWhen he asks me to stay over, that's when I start to feel discomfort. I don't care what happens to my body, but my mental state is fragile. I only want to sleep in the same place as a man I trust and love. If he isn't looking for love, the idea of sleeping over scares me. I don't want to become attached to someone that will drop me if he suddenly enters a situation where he is able to pick and choose his friends. I've been declining his invitations so far and saying I need to make sure I'm mentally ready first and he just keeps saying \"I know, but I really want you to. I know you'll enjoy it and I miss your company. I trust you and believe in you. I think you'll be fine, you won't have a panic attack.\"\n\nI'll do my best to kindly say \"You may think I'll be fine, but your thoughts could be wrong. You hardly know me.\"\n\n\nI just don't know what to say or do. He stopped me the other night and said \"I just want you to know I'm not just interested in you for your body. You have an amazingly accepting mind. You're so open.\"\n\n\nBut I don't know if I can believe him. Is it just because men in my past were either burdened by me or hurt me? Am I having post-traumatic paranoia? \n\n\n\n---   \n**tl;dr**: Guy I've known for a week takes me from being a complete and total virgin to loving anal sex with no shame, but I DO get uncomfortable when he wants me to stay the night. I don't know what to think of him.","permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/1z8kmu/my_18f_new_romantic_venture_21m_of_one_week_has/","link_flair_text":"Dating","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"My [18F] new romantic venture [ 21M] of one week has made me comfortable with casual sexual fun, but I'm uncomfortable when he wants me to stay the night at his apartment.","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.relationships","subreddit":"relationships","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1393645387"}

When we broke up about 4 months ago, and I swore up and down I was over it all. You didn't like the format of our relationship and couldn't handle this distance any longer. 5k miles makes it hard to maintain a stable romantic relationship, and I understand.\n\nAnd up until today I thought I was over it all and I thought we could remain best friends.

You wouldn't leave me alone about it until I said yes, some would consider that flirting butwhatever), but I need to get it out some how. I've never connected with another human being as well as I have with you. There doesn't go a day where I don't think about you, and it's common for it to happen more than once a day.

I know it was hard but I thought the happiness we brought each other shrouded the disappointment of not being to see one another physically. But I guess being a really close friend is good too. Having you out of my life when I did because I decided to cut contact wasn't exactly the most fun time for me. I was without a good friend and someone I felt like was honestly listening to what I had to say. Someone who would agree with me on most things, and if you didn't you'd give me a new perspective on what I was disagreeing with and make me realize that I may be wrong. \n\nI can't get over you.

I'm 26 years old and I'm going back to school. Yeah, that alone is unnerving enough. Looking over my required courses I see trigonometry, geometry, electrical circuits and physics to name a few. The level of anxiety I feel about those courses pales in comparison to the following course: Public speaking.\n\nI'm not sure why they've deemed this class a necessity for an Associate of Applied Sciences degree, but I'll man up and take it I guess. Not only do I have some SA problems that are likely to complicate things, but this course is also coming along in the first semester so I'm already going to be nervous because I'm new to the whole damned college thing.\n\nNow, I've made great strides in the face of social anxiety. When I was a teen I would often tweak out in such simple situations as paying through the McDonalds drive through. Not anymore. Now I can grab my change from that biotch and not think twice about it. I guess time and forcing myself to socialize has helped me a lot. \n\nIt's still not gone though. It pops up from time to time. For instance, if the conversation amongst co-workers drifts into a subject I'm not comfortable with I sometimes have difficulty handling it. In really bad situations my heart starts racing and I start getting this annoying twitchy tick thing going on with my upper lip then I think, \"Oh shit, I'm having a panic attack!\" and of course that only makes me more nervous which reduces my mind to a disfunctional wreckage and my upper lip starts going to town... Thankfully these episodes have gotten pretty rare over the past several years. I've lightened up a lot.\n\nI have no idea how things will go getting up in front of a classroom of people I don't know. I haven't tried something like this since I was a kid. I don't think imagining them naked will help. I'm planning on getting lots of exercise, healthy food, and social interaction around the time my classes start. I find these things help me feel more confident. Also (and don't laugh until you try it), I find meditation helps. It improves my level of concentration and focus.\n\nDoes anyone here have any suggestions to add to this?\n","permalink":"/r/socialanxiety/comments/1z8mx1/public_speaking_class_coming_up_any_suggestions/","link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"author":"failure_ftw","from":null,"id":"1z8mx1","archived":true,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_1z8mx1","saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":3,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":2,"stickied":false,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1z8mx1/public_speaking_class_coming_up_any_suggestions/","from_kind":null,"created":1393647213,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r22n","from_id":null}

We just purchased a fairly nice house this past year and are recovering from several debts which are almost paid off.  We have lived together for two years and have owned a our home for a year.\n\nMy question to you is what is your opinion on having children within the first couple of years of marriage? My take on it is to wait several years because I feel like I am not done enjoying my twenties with a good income and no kids. Heck, I guess this question could even apply to younger folks who have had kids that were previously in my situation.  I want to know how your experience has been with children and how you would do it if you could do it again.\n\nFor example, I just got a motorcycle this fall. I love the damn thing. I know that when I have my first child, I will probably have to get rid of it for the money as well as it being a dangerous life choice. I feel that if I have children too soon I am going to regret not taking a little more time for myself and my wife before devoting everything towards my kids.\n\nI think that having children is going to be a great thing for me whenever it does happen, I just don't have the gift of hindsight in this situation. I'm excited about the thought of starting a family but I want to hear what you have to say about it.  Your input would be greatly appreciated.\n\nNot to sound rude, but I really only want to hear answers from folks who are 30+ and have had kids.
