I love the bike, but after I get up to maybe an hour into a ride I feel like it would be more comfortable if the handlebars were just about 3\/4\" (~2cm) closer to me. The vast majority of my rides are 10-20 miles, stretching out a little too far for the last few miles is no big deal. But I have a 110 mile route that I'd like to do later this summer, and stretching out for the last 7-8+ hours doesn't sound fun. I already have my seat slid forward all the way, I think the only options left are a stem or a new bike. I don't want the handlebars any lower, just further back. \n\nIt's a good bike, with shimano 105 all the way around, but it is 16 years old with a 3x9 drivetrain and rim brakes. I doubt I could sell it for more than $400 and a new bike of similar quality would probably be $1,000+. I would swap if I could do it for net $200 or less, but it's not worth $600+ to me. I'm 5'9\", and it's a 56cm frame, my bike shop would like to just sell me a new bike, and ultimately they're probably right. I'd just rather cobble this one together for a few more years first.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"cycling","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhyi","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/cycling","subreddit_subscribers":266641,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"How much can you fix with a stem swap?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.63,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cycling\/comments\/ovi0yc\/how_much_can_you_fix_with_a_stem_swap\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Completely new to this subreddit so feel free to educate me in any way with a term I may use or the way I phrase anything, I won't take offense! For reference, I identify as F and I'm 21 recent college grad.\n\nOver the past year and a half, I've recently been coming into my own, gaining confidence, and finding out more about myself. I'm trying to change the way I view the world through many cultural lenses and wanted to start a discussion on sexuality as it pertains to long-term relationships. I didn't really see or understand the way sexuality can be viewed on a spectrum until I went to college. Mostly what I see on campus I've categorized as queerbaiting because at my university it seems like everybody is making out with everyone. Over the years, I've realized that people use alcohol as a shield to explore their sexual impulses because society makes them feel shameful for not following heteronormative ideals that have been thrust upon us since birth.\n\nI've recently discovered that I love hooking up with women even though I've always identified myself as straight. I don't prescribe to any labels now because I like what I like and labels are used as a means for others to categorize you because they need a way to put you in a neat little box to make themselves feel comfortable. Idgaf what makes you comfortable, I'm happy and content with my life so you can either accept that or gtfo of my face. Even though I have no problem being with a woman sexually, I personally do not see myself in a long-term relationship (i.e. marriage, common-law, bf\/gf type of stuff). Now is that the remnants of the toxic heteronormative society that I find myself in or do others see themselves the way I do.\n\n***TL;DR***\n\nFinally understand the meaning of sexuality as a spectrum after going to college.

I’m looking for someone (21+) interested in something pretty epic. Before we get to the details… I am 25 and recently married! I use Discord and am looking for responses a few times a week. Daily posts are not necessary, so please do not expect them from me. I put a LOT of effort into my writing and my responses can get quite lengthy if I’m super into a scene. I am also always up for OOC chat and plotting. Even just some friendly conversation from time to time. I don’t bite! Bottom line is that life comes first. This is my hobby, not a full time job!\n\nPlease, please, please read this disclaimer carefully: I am **specifically looking** for an **experienced, multiple paragraph\/novella style writer** willing to play as a **male character against a female character for our mains**. We can have plenty of NPCs and side characters or varying genders. Be someone who genuinely enjoys plotting, creating character backgrounds, face claims, etc. Also, please commit to our story if you are serious about it. I’ve had people plot and then fizzle out. I know life happens, but it’s upsetting to lose potentially a great storyline.\n\nCurrent Craving(s): I started reading A Court of Thorns and Roses a few weeks ago and got SO immersed into it during my recent beach vacation. It was honestly the first book I’ve read in awhile and I can’t wait to pick up the second copy this week. I’m looking to create something in this universe, preferably with OCs and before Feyre as I’m still reading the series. I’m looking for slow-burn romance, drama, angst, heartbreak, and of course, plenty of faeries. Something that we can create together. It doesn't have to be 100% canon!\n\nPM me if interested.

I never got higher than a C in math class past 5th grade. My younger self regarded math as boring, arbitrary, and totally not worth my time and effort. In short, while I caught the \"science bug\" at a very young age, outside of its applications in science I never understood how people could do mathematics as a hobby or as a profession.\n\nNow I am 21 and starting my second year of community college as an engineering major. And I've gotta say, after taking all of my remedial maths courses (algebra, precalculus &amp; trig) this past year I am absolutely hooked. I have become so interested in mathematics that one of my professors took notice and landed me a job at my college as a maths and science supplemental instruction leader. I have also started to do maths problems that I think of randomly throughout the week on my own time which is the subject of this post.\n\nToday, I wanted to figure out if I could come up with a formula that would give me the area of a circle for any given radius after the area of a square (whose diagonal is equal to the diameter of the circle) has been subtracted from it. I think I've got it, but I am still pretty new to mathematics so I feel like I might be missing something. My proof is below.\n\nFinally, I would like to find the limit as r approaches 0 and r approaches infinite of the ratio pi\\*r\\^2\/2\\*r\\^2. However, I haven't taken calculus yet and I only have a working knowledge of finding derivatives of elementary functions. I don't want to know the answer (I would like to find that out for myself), but could someone point me in the right direction?\n\nAll help is appreciated!\n\nedit: math\\[s\\] (sorry!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/houpm31o4ne71.jpg?width=4160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbb46f9840606033c1b8b494f414d54b6ededc7d","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"maths","subreddit_id":"t5_2qitk","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/maths","subreddit_subscribers":21621,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":105,"thumbnail_width":140,"title":"Recently became interested in math, is my formula\/proof correct?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/maths\/comments\/ovidhw\/recently_became_interested_in_math_is_my\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I also have anywhere from mild to severe reflux with it. Usually no chest pain, but alot of gas out of both ends and nausea. Had a lot of chest pain in the past, but idk if weight loss or something changed that.\n\nI'm finding it hard to exercise, everytime i get sick i lose like 10 pounds because i struggle to eat, and even though i have weight to lose i dont love the fatigue and all that sets in with it. \n\nAnyways, I just, I'm not sure what to try at this point. I've been to a billion doctors and several hospitals. It deliberates me to the point where its hard to work. It will  come and go. For example, before last week, i was doing pretty good that last 3 or 4 months, maybe longer. But once it hits I am useless and feel like death. I take Bentyl, up to 30-40mg because 10 doesnt usually work, but half the time it doesnt work and when it does it also makes me incredibly tired. I also take Lansoprazole 30mg before breakfast and sometimes before dinner. I already go to therapy(was on a weekly basis, recently switched to biweekly but might go back weekly) \n\nIve gone as far to cut gluten out my diet months ago, which i thought was the cause but here I am. During the flare I've eaten very light, simple meals. Rice, baked potatoes and chicken have been the majority of what ive consumed. Doctors seem to not really find any solution for me, I've had multiple endoscopies\/ultrasounds\/xrays done. I was in one of the best mental states ive ever been before I got sick and now im just depressed again. I feel just... so useless. On top of that I cant really take any ssris or stuff like that. I've tried them and they make stomach pain worse\/more nausea and basically ive taken an arrange of mental health drugs from antipsychotics(which did the opposite and contributed to psychosis along with fainting in the past) add meds, anti anxiety and depressants. \n\nI don't know what else to do. I'd take any surgery, any medicine. I smoke weed for the pain but it only does so much. Mostly it just helps my mind be more distracted from it. \n\nI've been trying to find work from home positions, ai even have a college degree in communications but i find no luck. Right now working at retail is really straining, and I have to call out so often that eventually im going to get written up or even fired for it, especially since I'm in an at will state.\n\nI really just need any and all advice. I've probably left out some things I've tried, but it feels like ive done what I can. I feel like my mental health has took such a hit because im sick to the point I'm suicidal again. I dont like the idea of dealing with this my entire life. But if I do have to, I really want to find a way to still sustain myself and have some sort of happiness and family cause my life cant just be a life of nothing because at any random given time this chronic illness will spike. I really do want to fight this and I feel defeated that ive tried so hard and im still here.\n\nAnyway, thank you to anybody who read this, and to anyone who gives me advice.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ibs","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3g1","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ibs","subreddit_subscribers":77253,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Desperate and looking for support\/advice for IBS-C","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ibs\/comments\/ovie1a\/desperate_and_looking_for_supportadvice_for_ibsc\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

This year, income is expected to be at least $1.1M with around $550K in cash and the rest in carried interest.  Current NW is around $6.5M with approximately $1.5M of that in carried interest (illiquid), $3.0M in liquid securities (stocks), and about $2M in private investments of mostly real estate.

The problem is, I am likely committing myself to another 5-10 years of high intensity 60-80 hour work weeks with a lot of stress.  \n\nI am wondering if others have been in a similar situation where they have done well, are FI could RE with a fairly comfortable situation (or just do something else that may be less stressful but probably make less money) but have a material career opportunity in front of them that could pay handsomely and had to make a decision between retiring early (RE), starting something new or staying with the high stress, high reward opportunity in front of them.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"fatFIRE","subreddit_id":"t5_3hqta","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/fatFIRE","subreddit_subscribers":308073,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"When to RE from Successful Career with More Upside","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.87,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/fatFIRE\/comments\/ovign4\/when_to_re_from_successful_career_with_more_upside\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I would like some advice regarding my skincare routine. \n\nI start by saying that I have skin that is prone to oily \/ mixed and acne-prone skin. I have noticed that the T-zone becomes particularly oily and this does not happen in the cheeks. \nA long time ago I started having a break of acne all over my face. Following the pharmacist's advice, I started using the bionike cleanser (Marseille soap) and benzac 5% (benzoyl peroxide. Then I switched to 10%). In doing so, the situation improved. Once this treatment was over, it wasn't long before the acne reappeared. Then I tried the Ordinary acids. I used the same cleanser plus vitamin c (Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12%), hyaluronic acid, alpha arbutin and the usual scrub. With the latter I got along well. More uniform skin color and at most very small pimples. I quit and after a few months I was getting worse again. I don't know why but this time the acne was concentrated on the forehead and near the nose. \"Mature\" acne, subcutaneous and redness. I used the same cleanser and scrub and for the tips I tried the ordinary niacinamide. In a few weeks the situation calmed down. I ran out of niacinamide, and in a few weeks I had the same problem again in the same spot. For this reason I started using a cleanser with niacinamide and burdock, an astringent tonic from roche posay and benzac 10% for two weeks. Then I stopped taking benzac and started using hyaluronic acid in the morning, vitamin C in the evening (the ordinary) and twice a week I'm trying to use AHA 30% (The ordinary) . The acne keeps popping up almost everywhere and are not in the forehead. Not even the time that one passes and two others appear. I also have a lot of spots \/ redness. (I shave once every 3 weeks or more. I know this is very irritating and can cause more pimples to appear.) As for the face cream, I've tried a lot but I've always had problems. They left my skin too greasy and I couldn't see the benefits. The last one I took is moisturizer for combination \/ oily skin. I used it a few days in small quantities but I noticed that it left my skin greasy and the redness \/ acne were getting worse. I noticed that in the T-zone I have very large pores.\n\nMy skincare routine now:\n- bionike cleanser (Marseille soap) -&gt; AM &amp; PM (is there any ingredient that is not right?)\n-  Distilled water with roses (Tonic) -&gt; AM &amp; PM (There is fragrance but I noticed an anti-inflammatory effect but is it necessary or could I take it off? )\n- Vitamin C (The Ordinary) -&gt; AM\n- Hyarulonic Acid (The Ordinary) -&gt; (AM only when I have to do the peeling in the evening) &amp; PM\n- AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution x2 days, PM\n- Moisturizing or clay masks -&gt; x2 days, PM (Immediately after peeling)\n- Green apple and kiwi moisturizing gel cream -&gt; AM &amp; PM (this cream does not make me shiny. I have not seen any negative effects. It gives a feeling of freshness)\n- 50+ sunscreen when I go out of the house (leaves my face a little oily)\n\nINCI BIONIKE CLEANSER:\naqua (water), glycerin, potassium oleate, potassium cocoate, hydroxyethylcellulose, polyquaternium-7, 1,5-pentanediol, disodium EDTA, parfum (fragrance).\n\nINCI TONIC:\nAQUA, ROSA CENTIFOLIA EXTRACT, ROSA CANINA FRUIT EXTRACT, ROSA DAMASCENA FLOWER EXTRACT, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCONL, PARFUM, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, TETRASODIUM EDTA, 2-BROMO-2-NITROPROPANE,METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE, METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE, GERANIOL, HYDROXYCITRONELLAL, CITRONELLOL.\n\nINCI OF MOISTURIZING GEL CREAM:\nQUA, ALCOL DENAT, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ISONONANOATE, HYDROGENATED ETHYLHEXYL OLIVATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, SACCHARIDE ISOMERATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, PYRUS MALUS JUICE, ACTINIDIA CHINENSIS FRUIT, HYDROGENATED OLIVE OIL UNSAPONIFIABLES, SODIUM ACRYLATES CROSSPOLYMER-2, HYDROXYACETOPHENONE, PARFUM, SODIUM POLYACRYLATE, HYDROGENATED POLYDECENE, ACRYLATES\/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, SODIUM PHYTATE, PPG-5-LAURETH-5, HEXYL CINNAMAL, SILICA, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, CITRIC ACID, CI 14700, CI 47005, CI 42090, CI 15985, SODIUM BENZOATE, CI 42051, POTASSIUM SORBATE.\n\nINCI SOLAR CREAM: \nAqua, Homosalate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Arginine, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Ether, Glycerin, Lauroyl Lysine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyacetophenone, Hydrolyzed Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Fruit Extract, Disodium EDTA.\n\nSo I would like an opinion on the routine in general that I am following now and advice on a face cream suitable for my skin. (If possible with a maximum budget of 10\/15 €).\n\nSkincare routine I could follow but I'm not sure how to switch products: (put in order of application)\n\n- Salicylic Acid Cleanser (The INKEY List) -&gt; AM (integrate slowly)\n- Niacinamide 10% (The Ordinary) -&gt; AM\n- Hyarulonic Acid (The Ordinary) -&gt; AM \n- Green apple and kiwi moisturizing gel cream -&gt; AM (or?)\n\n- Gentle cleanser -&gt; PM (maybe Cetaphil Oily Skin Cleanser?

She looks desperate and scared. \"I know him, and he's a bad man. I know you, and you're a good girl. Please, please don't go to him. You're smart, but he's smarter. Evil. He hurts people.\"\n\nYou look at your mom, hatred in your eyes. She'd claimed that your father died when you were young, but as of 15 minutes ago, you've found her to be lying. For some reason, she kept your father secret for you. You found an old picture of your father, one you've never seen before, with his real name and your mother's maiden name written on the back. A quick google search later, and you found your Dad. He only lived a few hours away.\n\nYou're furious. You spent your whole life desperate for a father, sure that if you ever had a Dad in your life, you could make him love you. You'd do anything to convince him to stay.\n\nWith one last look of disgust towards your mom, you say, \"Maybe he just hurts dumb cunts that deserve it.\"\n\nAnd with that, you take the crumpled up piece of paper with your deadbeat father's address, and you leave. \n\nYour mom begs you, \"Please, please don't go. Please don't trust him. Please don't love hi-\" Your mom's voice dies when you slam shut the door of the trailer home. \n\n-----------------------------------\n\nMy grip tightens on the 19-year old blonde. Her bleached hair is wrapped tightly around my fist, giving me complete control over her body, as I keep her head pulled to the base of my cock. Old, grey, curly pubes scratch against her face. I ram my cock against the back of her throat a few more times, causing her to gag. With each thrust, my heavy stomach brushes against her forehad. Every time she gags, I can feel her throat tighten around the head of my cock. \n\nHer face is red. Her beautiful, ocean eyes watery as she looks up at me. I smile, coo, \"Good girl.\" and then spit on her face, before finally letting her off my cock. The girl retches. A small amount of thick, viscous saliva comes up when she does, plastering itself to her B-cups. \n\n\"You look fucking pathetic, you know that?\" I say as I look down at the blonde, before spitting again on her face. \n\nI tower over the young slut. The teen couldn't be more than 5' or 100 pounds, but she looks even smaller compared to me. I'm 6'2, 240 pounds, and still strong as hell for my age. A monstrous, veiny, spit-covered cock stands at attention, with saggy, heavy balls hanging underneath. \n\nI take a step back towards the blonde, grabbing another fistful of her hair, ready to annihilate her throat. My cock is just inches from her lips, when I hear desperate banging on the front door of my apartment. \"Daddy?\" You ask from the outside of my apartment. \"It's your little girl. I'm 18 now. I'd really like to meet you.\"\n\nI have daughters around the globe, a few of which I've met, most of which I never knew existed. You fall into the second category. But, I can't stop myself from smiling when I hear your voice. You just sound desperate. I love desperate. \n\n------------------------------------\n\nHello! Today I'm looking to play out a Daddy\/Daughter roleplay where I'm a complete piece of shit with a massive cock and intoxicating cum. I want to play as a fat, gross, monstrously hung man who turns every woman he talks into a no-limits whore. \n\nI'm thinking I left your mother shortly after we fucked. I don't even remember her name. There are thousands of women that I've done that to. You and your mother aren't remarkable or special in anyway. At least at first glance. \n\nWhat I want to be special about you is how desperate you are for Daddy to love you. What are you willing to do for me? Do you have any self-respect left, or will you abandon everything to finally get to be Daddy's Little Girl?\n\nDaddy's love language is forcing you to gag on his cock. Can you do that for Daddy?\n\nMy kinks are just about everything, but this should give you an idea: Intense humiliation\/degradation. Face-fucking (hard enough to make you puke... bonus points if you're willing to drink back down your puke). Painal. Facials. Cumplay. Spitplay. Petplay. Intense beatings. Whips. Clamps. Misogyny. Toilet play. MFF threesomes. Girls helping me rape\/torture other girls. Raceplay. DD\/lg. None of these are required, but they can be fun in their own ways.\n\nI'll only play with you if you're above 18 and all characters are over 18. That's a hard limit. Almost everything else is up for negotiation. \n\nI hope to hear from you! In your first message, tell me how desperate you are for Daddy's love.

There's real tangible inertia in the movement. The body moves with real force, pristine physics. It also makes the appropriate ruckus for someone being force fed super soldier nuts. It was so great. The funniest part about it wasn't the crouching animation, it was how the victim's body responded. Legendary game design.\n\nHalo Infinite tech demo isn't having none of that. Act Man literally just crouched up and down. There's no force behind it. It lacks power and physics. It's a shadow of it's former self. I just don't get the same nostalgia from this. It kind of made me want to dig out my beater Xbox 360 just to T bag somebody on sandtrap and tell them to get fucked. Too bad the servers are down now.\n\nT bagging is immature douchebaggery incarnate. But I don't care. It brings me back to a better time. It brings me back to those long Saturday nights with my Cheeto crusted controller just telling people to get fucked and doing the deed. It was such a carefree time. I had endless hours to do this.

It was easier for my parents to lump us together and since we went along with it so happily it just happened that it worked out that I was basically just moved up a grade in most social settings. My sister's friends were my friends, her interests mine and so on and so forth. And, while I enjoyed growing up like this, I've since come to realize that I think this might have had more of a negative effect on my than I thought.\n\nI was a late bloomer. To name a few of the curses that plagued me, I had a horrible sense of fashion, a big forehead, crippling anxiety, that ungodly hormonal acne, a gigantic butt, and about a hundred things more. Meanwhile, my sister has always been gorgeous. From the moment she was old enough to get a boy's attention, she's had it. She had long legs and great muscles, all the things I never had. She was skinny with pretty skin that never got acne. I was always a little jealous, and to be honest I still am. But her luck didn't stop there. Beyond being gorgeous, t she was charismatic and extroverted, and drew people to her effortlessly. Even as children, the guys we played with innocently flocked to her, while I always ran along behind trying to catch up. Boys ALWAYS had a crush on her, and I, jealously wished to be just the same. Obviously, she was a big hit with with the guys throughout our most formative years, meanwhile the most I got was that I was \"a lovely young flower waiting to bloom\", or, even worse \"she's got a great personality\" (which I did and do have, thank you very much--I am funny as hell).\n\nWhelp, I'm struggling to feel like I've bloomed. I'm 24 and after years of anxiety, depression, and endometriosis doing its damage, I've settled into a mediocre human being. (wow, don't I sound sad. Trust me, sometimes I look in the mirror and think I'm hot shit). I'm moderately sized, although I usually end up being the fat friend, which is never the most encouraging female. Hormonal acne has remained my closest companion and probably will remain as long as my body continues to tear itself apart from the inside, and I'm still just a bit too shy and socially anxious to light up the room when I walk in the way my sister does. My forehead is still big, though I've learned to live and work with it, I've sort of figured out how to dress myself, and it turns out the proper term is dummy thicc and not, fat. Over all, I've grown up and for a while I was thinking I hadn't done too bad. I would have maybe called myself a 7, and if you take things like a great sense of humor and a little cute nerd behavior into consideration, maybe even an 8.\n\nBut, my friends, we're fading fast.\n\nI've had a few attempts at dating. They've all ended fairly quickly, mostly because the guys who seem to actually be interested usually turn out to be very desperate and pushy, like their starved for water and I'm the water bottle that got left in the car last week and is now tepid and gross. It's like, I'm not what they want, but they're desperate for satisfaction, so I'll do for now. It's not exactly the most wonderful feeling, and I've almost just given up looking entirely because of it. I always did my best not to base my self worth off of male attention, I don't think it's a healthy way for anyone to live their life, and yet, feeling like nobody would want you is a hard thought to shake, and there's something a little humiliating about your friend getting bought a drink by that hot guy at the bar while you sit there and try not to acknowledge the creep in the back whose been making weird faces at you all night.\n\nThat being said, I've persevered until recently.\n\nMy self confidence took a HUGE digger last summer. Around that time, I'd come to realize that for me, it's important to know the person I'm dating before we agree to date. I really need a friendship before I can move on to something bigger. That being said, that's easier said than done, and so I'd been bemoaning that fact all year. Then, my sister got engaged and planned a wedding and the most amazing thing happened. The best man was a guy who'd I'd grown up with since a tiny tot, and who I was very familiar with. ANd...he'd gotten hot. And because fortune smiled upon me, it got even better: he was single and *looking*.\n\nI couldn't have imagined anything more perfect. Apparently, as his family was friends with mine, our mothers had been chatting and this guy was really wanting to find a girl who could match pace with him--who was into adventures but not clingy, who liked the outdoors and animals, but also liked providing space. I was like \"hello, avid trail rider, hunter, hiker, and introvert??? I am the woman he has been waiting for??\" Honestly, he was too perfect, and that probably should have been the first hint that this wouldn't work. But, I tried anyway. As the wedding approached, I did my best to both be forward enough for him to get the idea I was interested, but not intrusive. I didn't want to be annoying, I only wanted to put the idea in his head.\n\nEither I'm \\*very\\* subtle, or I'm so average I'm invisible, because I'm here talking about the way my self confidence took a digger. He barely even noticed me. \n\nNow, if you've made it this far I applaud you, it's a lot. But, thankfully, we've finally reached the summary where I ask for advice.  I'm a young woman who knows that confidence is sexy, but is struggling to overcome being the unsexy \"blooming flower\" all her life and start to believe she's desirable. I'm still staggering from a rejection because, *for once*, it was someone I genuinely was attracted to and **really** wanted to try a relationship with, and it was almost like I was invisible or maybe even worse, actively not wanted. I cannot help but hear the voices that say I'm undesirable. I cannot help but hear the voices that say \"if you just did \\_\\_\\_\" or \"if you just fixed \\_\\_\\_\\_ guys would actually be interested\". And, I KNOW those voices aren't fair. I know that self-confidence is attractive, and hell, I even know that I am a great person with so much going for her. But, how do I fight off the sting of rejection, and how to I pick myself back up and get myself in the ring when it's so engrained in me that I'm not that appealing? How do I look at myself and tell myself I'm likable\/desirable when there never seem to be any relationships\/interested guys around to prove it?\n\nAny advice or words of encouragement?

Growing up, as a parent should, she cared for me and loved me like I was her own. She adopted me at birth to give me a better life. During my childhood my mother was very protective and really prevented me from making a lot of major decisions in my life. For a short while I felt angry at her but never let her know. As I grew older and had kids of my own I understood her intentions more. Anyway, she is 81, I am 31 so there was always a huge age gap between us.

My friend who worked in the hospital was always my moms nurse coincidentally. More recently, closer to her death, she had mentioned to me that it feels like all the life in her body is just being drained. Admittedly, I was very nervous. She also said that if she ever can’t talk anymore and was sick she wanted to be taken off any life support. \n\nTwo weeks before her death she was admitted into the hospital again. She went from her usual admittance reason to doctors telling us she may need to be on a feeding tube. We had several meetings with doctors and they gave her roughly four weeks to live. Overnight her condition got worse and they gave her 48 hours. 6 hours later, she died. \n\nAfter her death and after the funeral I felt lost. I cry so often. More than I ever have in my life. I visit her grave everyday. But I’ve been so so sad and empty feeling since my mother died in May. When does it get better?

It's been very difficult for me to find someone outside the church that shares Christian values and a love for God.

I have friends on both sides so I don't really care as long as every conversation we have isn't about the stolen election, covid, etc. 😂😂 I've heard that there are towns around Irvine which are very conservative but I'm just trying to understand how much we're talking :)\n\nThanks!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"orangecounty","subreddit_id":"t5_2rd9x","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/orangecounty","subreddit_subscribers":288855,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Where to live if moving from Seattle to Irvine","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.53,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/orangecounty\/comments\/ovino1\/where_to_live_if_moving_from_seattle_to_irvine\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I procrastinated on doing my chore (I would have done it the other night but my mom wanted me to rub her feet and I accidentally fell asleep in her room and didn't leave until 4:30 am this happens a lot I did some of the chore in the morning and saved the rest for tonight) and my mother started to yell about it she yells at me ending in do you understand and I say mhm then yes ma'am she then proceeded to accuse me of disrespecting her at first I thought it was about my chore ( I accept the fact I should have done it before) but then she from down the hall starts talking to herself and says it was about my eyes darting places and how I was disrespectful I didn't raise my voice (I almost never raise my voice at her) I didn't roll my eyes I have no idea what she's talking about that's when she said \"I would slap you if I could\" very loudly I'm assuming so I could hear her very heartbreaking but at this point I'm not surprised she raised her hand to slap me before when I was younger I put my hand up to protect myself so there's that does this happen to anyone my friends and therapist think I should talk to her but she has told me and my siblings she doesn't have to listen to us because we are her children and she is the parent so I gave up on talking to her I kinda laugh at the fact she wants to hit me my life has been down for a while so at this point I have a harder time feeling things like I should it's kinda sad how I've become so used to stuff like this that I can laugh at it has this happened to anyone what did you do I just wanna stay silent till I'm 18 and can do something about it my therapist says it's not fair for me to suffer in silence but idk what else to do I've tried talking to my mom about stuff and she scares me I just can't do it what scares me is not the fact she may or may not hit me but the fact she might hate me or just say I'm disrespectful and ungrateful for having suicidal thoughts or having self harmed in the past she's not ok with that stuff I don't know how she'll act I'm scared I don't know what to do she won't listen and I'm too scared to speak I'm working on taking a mini vow of silence (stupid I know but I'm desperate) if anyone has done that pls give me advice I don't know what else to do Everytime I open my mouth things get worse for me I wish I was a better daughter I feel so depressed my school has been slipping and those dark thoughts of dying have been coming back along with the urge to SH and recently for the first time I've wanted to just not eat I really don't want to develop an eating disorder I looked up how to starve yourself and I don't know why I've always told myself no matter what I wouldn't get an ED pls if you have any advice I'm open to it I'm so lost and lonely I spent most of today crying I can't tell my therapist about me wanting to commit suicide or the selfharm or wanting to eat less because I'm not an adult so she will have to tell my mom and she can't find out she'll never look at me the same again I'm so scared and so sick of fighting this alone pls help me I'm sorry for complaining and for having to ask but pls I'm getting hopeless I wanna give up I see almost no use in going on the only thing keeping me alive is my religion and my pets and my little nieces and new nephew I don't want you to die I just want the constant pain to end I don't want to

Stories with multiple scenes\/chapters that slowly build tension pushing the envelope further, and further until (almost) nothing is off limits. I have a couple of prompts below that could help us get started, but I'm open to other ideas as well.\n\n**Prompt #1**\\- The Conservative Mom Next Door - You play a highly conservative mom in this scenario. Of course you are traditionally attractive, but you put almost no effort in to your appearance. You wear muted colors and unflattering ensembles that hide most of your body. But that hasn't stopped me (your son's best friend) from developing quite the crush on you. I am drawn to your kind eyes and electric smile. Now that I'm 18 and starting to think about sex 24\/7, my crush is begging to deepen. I look for any excuse to invite myself over to your house and try to stay for dinner just to be around you longer. You on the other hand, couldn't be more oblivious to the attention I'm giving you. Maybe that's about to change?...So what might you be hiding under that extremely conservative wardrobe? How do I make my crush known to you? There are a lot of directions we could go, so I'll leave the rest up to our imagination.\n\n**Prompt #2**\\- I Heard a Rumor - I hear a few guys talking in the locker room about a girl. They don't know I can hear, but I can't help but ease drop because what they are saying is utterly jaw dropping.

My mother didn’t tell me and my siblings why he went to jail. I found out online in an old news article a coupe years later when I looked him up. A few years after that I found him on the registry. I do not know who the victim of his crime is, and it is not me. For those reasons I will not discuss the details of his crime. \n\nAt a young age, I heard about studies that claimed to prove that children of sex offenders, particularly violent ones, are at a much higher risk to offend as well. Even Law and Order: SVU released an episode in which the prosecution attempted to prove the existence of a  “Rape gene”. Many of these studies are of course flawed, as reliable data in this area is difficult to accurately gather. But just Hearing about these things as a kid was, and still is, a source of anxiety and insecurity for me. \n\nTo be clear, I do not believe that I am at a risk of assaulting someone, and I have never felt the urge to. I am not scared of becoming my father. My fear is set in how people will perceive me if they find out. I have always been scared of how a girl might react after finding out about my dad. I feel that it would be irresponsible for me to not disclose that information early on; at least before we are intimate. At the same time I am terrified of it being a source of discomfort for her, or it being the reason she decides that we won’t work out. \n\nBecause of this I have never been with a girl or pursued a relationship. I have never even asked a girl out. I think a big part of this problem is just in my head, but I’ve never discussed it with anyone.
