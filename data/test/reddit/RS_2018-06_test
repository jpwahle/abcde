I don't even know if this is emotional abuse, but I need someone to know. I am 13 years old, and I've been dealing with this since I was 7. I should explain it from the start, including my mother's illness...\n\nI was around 5 or 6 when my mother had a seizure. I don't remember when, what it looked like or sounded like... anything, really. I can only remember where. Right in my own home, in the dining area, my mother collapsed from her chair and onto the floor. My oldest sister ran, crying and went to the nearest phone to call 9\\-1\\-1. Crying, sirens... it was all blurred out as I sat on my chair looking at my mother. I didn't understand.\n\nShe went to the hospital and came back a week or two later, I can't remember it exactly. She was so sick, and I don't even know if my siblings helped her. My dad did, but I don't know about my older siblings. They were irresponsible \\(one of them still is\\) at the time as adolescents. \n\nNobody told me her kidneys were failing. I don't think they knew, I don't even know... \n\nA year later my mother went for laser eye surgery, as she was also worse in her right eye. They used the wrong thing, and her eye became even worse. I was sitting in my father's lap in the other room. My mom came out, her eye covered in bandages. We went home.\n\nThe next day I saw her in a ball on the floor, complaining about a headache. The sun was bothering her, so we closed all the blinds we could. She ended up staying upstairs for a while. Nobody helped her again. She told me that she felt like she had to do everything.\n\nI remember seeing her blurry eye, her pupil practically disappeared. It was a blurry circle. She always looks so scared in that eye...\n\nThey knew she had diabetes, but 1 year later they found out her kidneys were failing. She had to be put on dialysis. We drove her to the hospital and picked her up every other day. She was becoming more and more stressed. \n\nOur family started fighting more as well. As my brother and sister grew up, I was forced to be with my younger sister. There were a lot of days when I heard my brother and my dad fighting. Should I explain? My brother and older sister are not my biological ones. They're half\\-siblings. My dad and my mom are my real parents, but they have a different dad.\n\nMe and my sister hid upstairs a lot. While they were fighting, I thought about stopping it, then something usually happened... someone threw something and it scared me. It was so scary, and I felt terrible. I felt sad. \n\nI was always a linguistic child, and I was emotionally and verbally smarter than most kids. But I was shy and I didn't talk much, so my grades plummeted. In Grade 2, my mother walked us to school. When she got sick, she couldn't walk us anymore. I missed a lot of days because of it. I was terrible at math because of it. Kids got ahead, and I missed somethings. A *lot* of somethings. \n\nAnyways, fast forward 3 or 4 years, and my mom gets a transplant. A kidney transplant, to be exact. She no longer had diabetes, no more kidney failure... but she wasn't at home. She was at the hospital, her insides being drained out. She had some problems during the transplant, but they needed to keep her for 1 month to keep her alive. So she didn't 'reject' her organs.\n\nI helped a lot at home during that time. But the absence of my mother made me depressed, and sad. I love her so much but she's just so stressed.\n\nNow, 2 years later, things have happened. \n\nShe's literally fucking insane. She constantly cries and screams at me for not doing simple things, but I'm a kid. That's no excuse, but I don't deserve this. A few things I heard from my parents in the past few months;\n\n\"I'm not the maid,\"  \\- my mother\n\n\"Get your ass down here!\" \\- my father\n\n\"This is so fucking stupid.\" \\- my mother\n\n\"I fucking hate this.\" \\- my mother\n\n\"Stupid bitch!\" \\- my brother\n\n\"You won't have any stupid online friends soon, cause Daddy will do something.\" \\- my sister \\(younger\\)\n\nMy younger sister has been barging into the bathroom when I'm in there too long \\(explanation is really TMI\\) and she insults me constantly. This isn't sibling rivalry anymore, this isn't parenting anymore. This isn't a good life anymore. I hate myself, I'm not hungry, I have no internet, I steal, I adapt, I'll do this. But I hate myself. This isn't a good environment.\n\nI'm forced to leave my own fucking house because my brother screams that I'm some suicidal bitch. That I'm autistic, or I have Asperger's. It's so stupid, I just want it to end. School work, family, relationships... It's too much. What can I even do? I can't leave, I told my teacher but she didn't believe me... But I didn't tell her the whole story.\n\nWhat am I going to do?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"abuse","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7d2","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/abuse","subreddit_subscribers":2798,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I am a minor and in an unsafe (emotionally) home.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/abuse\/comments\/8nnghc\/i_am_a_minor_and_in_an_unsafe_emotionally_home\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I'm not just referring to the  u\/typical_ee post (although that is what reminded me make this particular post), I'm talking about a general feeling I get reading the comments. I'd like to make a case why I enjoy posts that seemed to be perceived as \"whining\". I think a lot of you think that if we acknowledge problems asian-american males face, we're somehow letting them define us. Truthfully, I don't get this POV at all.\n\nI think by this sub's standards, I'm a sexually semi-successful dude. I'm 23, I had a long term GF from 18-20 then went on to fuck a couple girls till I met my current GF. I've had a total of 12 sexual partners in my life. That being said, even as a dude who fucks, I've still faced the sexual stereotypes that most asian men face. I still like to have a place I can talk about that, even though I have a GF! I've never let these stereotypes get in the way of my romantic life, but I also never pretended they didn't exist or that they didn't affect my prospects.\n\nI come to r\/asianmasculinity because there are things about the asian male experience that are different about the classic white western experience. I come here to talk about those things with fellow asian males. However, a lot of these things, depending on what you look like and where you live, are going to be negative. Talking about them and acknowledging them doesn't have to be some sort of nihilistic depressive experience. I'm able to think about negative things without them consuming my entire life and killing myself, because well, I'm a normal well adjusted human being.\n\nIf the point of this sub is relentless self improvement, while ignoring social issues, then it doesn't really need to be r\/asianmasculinity does it? A lot of the things needed to be sexually successful (being fit, dressing well, being confident) aren't inherently asian male issues. Most of the best advice for those topics probably wouldnt be found on this sub, right? I feel like a lot of the recent mantra of this sub is basically \"be better than everyone else\", in which case I think we might as well shut the sub down, because again, the answers to \"how do i be better than everyone else in the dating game\" wont have answers that are unique to asian males right?\n\nMy main point is: there are some of us who posts about \"negative\" things that aren't beta-incel virgins, we just talk about the issues of being an asian male.

This will also mean you cannot keep harassing my husband's family, or my friends. No contact means no contact.\n\nI pray that you realize what you have done to me. I am a broken human being because of you, I can forgive you for what you put me through, but I cannot forget.\n\nI will also be asking a lawyer if we can contact your VA therapist as I feel you're a threat to me and I genuinely fear that you will come after me. I fear you will end up killing me one day. If not outright, then because your behavior puts me in the hospital from a nervous breakdown or my Crohn's Disease acting up due to the stress.\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI'm sorry to everyone that had to read that. I just had to get it out there. If someone wants to share that with her, go ahead. But I'd she contacts me directly, I will call the police on her for violation of a no contact notice which I sent her last year via email and I've been told should have been sufficient.\n\nAs for the things she tries to say, guess what? Lies. I am doing quite well. Since I stopped speaking with her, my Crohn's Disease has been better, I was approved for disability and was able to stop working. My husband works part time so he can help me make it to doctor's appointments. And I am in therapy to deal with all the problems I have from the years of mental and physical abuse I suffered at the hands of this woman.\n\nSo before you go buying into her lies, ask me about some of the things she's done. She found a letter I wrote about cutting myself once, she proceeded to yell and scream at me, calling me worthless and a lier. And then beat me with a coffee mug. Or there's the time that she kicked me so hard in the butt that I couldn't sit down for days. Or that time she tried to push me down the stairs. Oh and the time she beat me because Patrick broke up with her for a week and she was pissed?\n\nDhs got called on her a lot when I was growing up, but unfortunately they never took me away.\n\nAgain, sorry for all of this. But it needed to be said.\n\nMom, I love you, but for my mental and physical well being, I can't have you in my life. I pray you find peace.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"offmychest","subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/offmychest","subreddit_subscribers":674981,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I just had to post this on my Facebook for my abusive mother to leave me alone.

Go to champagne room with dancer.\n\nClub tries to charge my card $790 twice. I first thought it declined because of being out of state so I had them try to run it again, then it turned out it was because of my credit limit.\n\nI did the math, 625 for a hour in dances, and 150 plus tax for the bottle, I have the bottle receipt.\n\nI tell dancer I can't afford that. She conveniently didn\u2019t mention the the hour dance charge lol.\n\nAgree to have just the bottle fee on my card.\nI also come to agreement with dancer for half the rate for half the time ($300).

Although I am doing quite well considering the length of time I've had the disease, I do have a left drop foot.  I have to wear a Walkaide brace when I'm out of the house, and walking even 1\/4 of a mile can be a challenge.  Other than that, I have some fatigue, numbness on my right side, and some weakness on my left side.  The drop foot and left lower extremity weakness are the least manageable of my symptoms, everything else I handle fairly well. \n\nI'm currently 35 weeks pregnant with twin girls, and have been in discussions with my doctors about my upcoming delivery.  I would like to deliver them vaginally, which in the case of twins would require an epidural since the second twin often needs assistance during delivery \\(the doctor reaches inside you and pulls them out, which is too painful to do unmedicated\\).  My OB anesthesiologists in Canada feel that having an epidural is unsafe, especially due to my drop foot, and recommend that I have a scheduled c\\-section and go under general anesthesia for the procedure.  My husband would not be allowed in the delivery room, and I would obviously not be able to do skin to skin with our babies, or see them until I'm woken up at least an hour after their birth.  This is far from ideal. \n\nI'm from the US and wrote my former MS doctor in California, who said there is absolutely no research that suggests that an epidural can further your disease, no matter how progressed the disease is already.   She shared a study with me to pass along to the anesthesiologists and offered to talk to them as well.  The anesthesiologists have scheduled another appointment with me next week to discuss this further.  From what I know from my OB, their fear is injecting a medication into my spine where I already have disease activity \\(the drop foot\\).  They also know there is a high rate of flare up postpartum for MS patients, and fear that the epidural may be the cause of those flare ups. Overall, the Canadian doctors all feel its safer for me to be put under general anesthesia for the delivery. \n\nHas anybody else dealt with this?  I'd really prefer not to have to go the general anesthesia route.  However, if there is even a 1&amp;#37; chance of my disease progressing more due to the epidural, I would gladly do what they recommend without hesitation.  I wrote my California doctor again to get her opinion in even more detail, but would love to know if any of you have any experience or knowledge in this area. \n\nThanks in advance for your input.

Just 10 or 20 acres would be enough. My dream is to only have to work part\\-time if I had to and live very frugally so that I could spend my free time maintaining the homestead and pursuing the things that I want to do, like writing and fixing things and making art.\n\nFirst, some background: I spent my high school and college years living on a homestead with my family, so I know some skills needed and what the life is like and this isn't just a fantasy. Right now I'm 23 years old and I'm pretty much a blank slate. I have a few grand in the bank account, an associates degree in business, two years of experience as an accountant, and a job that pays the bills for now. My goal is to live on a homestead by the time I'm around 30 years old.\n\nI've thought of what skills and careers would be best to have on a homestead that would allow me to live the life I want to.\n\nMy first plan was to learn something coding\\-related that would allow me to work from home, like web designing or software engineering. I already have some experience programming, and you don't necessarily have to have a big degree to do that. Unfortunately a lot of programming jobs require you basically plaster your name, face, and business all over the internet, and I have some personal privacy issues with that. I understand employers need to know who they're talking with, but I'm not really comfortable having that information out there. That, and I'm just not passionate about designing or programming.\n\nMy current plan is to go to trade school to learn how to weld and make a career out of it. I've known a couple of welders and I worked with my dad who was a machinist. I love the experience of working with my hands and leaving something permanent and tangible, a far cry from what I did as an accountant. The ironworking and welding jobs in my particular area are ridiculously high\\-paying, and it would be a versatile skill to have while living on a homestead. The bad part is that I don't have the money to pay for the tuition and equipment and all that, so I would be set back a bit and have to take out about $10k of student loans for all the certifications and classes. My plan would be to finish the program, work my ass off for a few years traveling around, then spend that money paying off debt, buying land and supplies, then invest the rest while doing side\\-jobs with my experience.\n\nAnother plan I've thought of is to utilize my current education and experience as an accountant, and live frugally until I could afford to buy land. On one hand I wouldn't have to go to school again and basically learn a new career all over, and I wouldn't have to take out any loans or debt if I went down this road. On the other hand, the accounting jobs here don't pay nearly that well, so I would have to wait longer doing a job I know I don't really like so I could be able to afford land. Really, this is more of a backup plan in case I am unable to weld for some reason.\n\nI know, this post probably would fit under r\/financialindependence, but I don't think many people there know about how much money is saved by living off the grid. Most of the people there want to be financially independent and still live a modern convenient lifestyle after retiring.\n\nBig reason I'm making this long post is: Are my plans sensible? Am I leaving anything out? Feel free to point out any mistakes I might have made or any alternatives that would be easier or make more sense!

I absolutely loved it, and it is an insanely good opportunity. I work remotely, am paid well, and have even gotten the chance to travel for work.\nMy degree is in international development and economics, so I felt this was a good place to start.\n\n\nHowever, the work environment and my boss are making this job nearly impossible to mentally survive. It seems everything I do angers her, or she doesn't not appreciate when I do things right, and expects me to be responsive 24\/7.\n\n\nI signed on for forty hours a week, and am easily going over that by almost double. I spoke to her about this, and even she has even mentioned that I work too much. But it quickly devolves back into text at 1am asking for urgent help, or asking me to rearrange entire days with no notice. Then she'll get angry that I am emailing people too much to change the plans. Much of this job is trying to read her mind, and having to change all the time.\nTo be clear, I am very good at my job, and she tells me so, but the lack of awareness and the tone she uses to speak to us makes wanting to work rare.\n\n\nI understand that founding a company and being a CEO is very difficult, and at this level mistakes are not to be made. However, our entire staff, besides our CEO is made up of me, and two college interns.\nThat's it, that is who is behind the CEO. We are responsible for everything, and it is not a viable way to run things, especially since we are younger and would like to attempt to have lives after work.\n\n\nI mostly feel that I jumped into a full time, very high demanding job too quickly, and that I am wasting my early twenties being a workaholic. I always have to have my phone on me at the ready, and people in my life have begun to notice. I do not have time to go out, I have to steal time to eat, shower, sleep, etc.\nI would kill to have a clearly defined 9-5 job in an office, I want that more than anything right now. I am deeply, deeply, unhappy, very stressed out, and rarely make it through the day without losing it.\n\n\nBut still, I want to be practical about this, and understand if leaving after 6 months (I am 3 months in) will make employers question why I didn't last, thus making me an unattractive candidate.\n\n\nWould it look bad to an employer to see I left a job, even amicably, after six months just out of college?\n\n\nTL;DR My job is a great opportunity, but the mental stress and emotional rollercoaster is making it very hard to envision staying on any longer than September.

I'm 16 and I knew how my Ngrandparents (who I live with) were about small things so when an actual problem that even normal rational parents would have a hard time calmly handling I knew I was in deep shit. \n\nWhen I told them, they flipped shit they said I would have to get an abortion, they said they would get my boyfriend arrested, they flipped absolute shit and I ended up trying to slit my throat that night because I'm already suicidal and they drove me past the edge. This ended up with me being taken to a mental hospital. \n\nWhen I was finally able to leave the hospital they wanted me to have a family meeting and discuss the changes that needed to take place to keep me from snapping again. I made a list of things, mostly things like respecting my decisions even if they don't agree with them and similar stuff but I also added points about me trying harder to help around the house, mostly just to appease them but I genuinely was willing to hold up my part. \n\nAt the meeting my Ngrandparents agreed to this and everything went smoothly so the hospital decided it was ok to send me home. Not even a day after I was home they were already flipping out at me again because I asked if my boyfriend could come over because I hadn't seen him since I was admitted into the hospital. \n\nAfter that they constantly would bring up the parts of the agreement that benefited them such as me helping out with chores while ignoring everything else. I honestly expected as much tho tbh. \n\nThey pressured me for months to get an abortion, going as far to gaslight me and say things like my mom called and told them she wanted nothing to do with me or the kid. (They knew I was texting her looking for advice and support and it made them angry.) She had never said anything like that and once I confronted them about it they claimed they didn't say she called they just said if she did call she'd probably say that. They also brought up how I'm unstable and I'd \"probably hurt my kid\" even though I'm more suicidal than abusive in any way shape or form, I've legit cried over killing an ant I could not lay a finger on anyone. \n\nSince then it's been constant emotional abuse, calling me a slut\/whore\/skank, saying they should rent me out as a prostitute, shit like that. They claim they say that kind of stuff because they were \"so hurt\" by this information. But honestly I would understand them being disappointed in me and upset for a while, but this goes beyond that to the point where I'm getting none of the support I need from them and am constantly under stress from their emotional abuse.\n\n\nTl;dr: Ngrandparents wanted me to get an abortion and didn't get their way so now they make my life a living hell.

I just don\u2019t know what to do. I want to stop feeling this way. \n\nSome background, my dad died in March of this year. Completely unexpected, he was waiting for the train home from work and he just dropped dead of a heart attack. No warning at all. He was 55. He and my mom were married for 24 years. I am 21 years old. \n\nFor whatever reason, somehow, despite being a really emotional person I\u2019m doing really well with his death. I\u2019m being really strong about it, and while of course my life has changed drastically and I feel like half of me is gone, this is not the end of the world for me. \n\nIt is for my mom, though. And for some reason it annoys me.

He\u2019s dead and he can\u2019t hear her. It hasn\u2019t even been 3 months. This is wrong and I feel bad about it. \n\nShe goes to this bereavement group at the hospital every week and last week I went with her just because I was curious to see what kind of stuff they do. When everyone else was talking about their dead husbands, or brothers or whoever else, I felt bad for them. But for some reason I just cannot empathize with my mom. For some reason I want her to just stop getting so damn upset all the time and move on. To just be strong like I am. I just want her to be happy. \n\nWhy do I feel this way? Am I just feeling displaced anger, that I\u2019m directing at her in this twisted way? How do I make it stop? Every time I get mad I feel so guilty. What do I do?

I am meeting with an advocate soon. I have no idea why this is getting so heavily downvoted (is it too long?) but I am glad that I was still able to get the help I needed. Regardless, I edited out most of the emotional \"fluff\" so that if someone tries to find the answers they need online\/reddit that they may find this post and learn something too. Thank you all so much for your time. This has given me the push I need to further my recovery. \n\nFor those wondering- as of 2016 there is no statute of limitations for sex crimes in California. Rainn was so easy to navigate and I truly feel so much better about this. Best of luck to those in the same boat.\n\n~Semi original post~\n\nI will try to keep this as short and unemotional as possible. This was deeply traumatic to me so I hope you all will understand if this gets rambley or deviates from the important details. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n \n Happened in 2012. July. Just turned 16. I am 21 now. \n\n \nI spent the night at a friend of a friends house (called BR), and her uncle (GS) molested me for hours. I was with my best friend (JE) and her friend BR.\n\n \nBR went to bed and I stayed up to talk to JE laying on a mattress on the floor. GS laid down beside me to \"join us\". I was in between JE and GS and he reached under the blanket and molested me the whole time. I didn't do anything to stop or bring attention to it. I know it was stupid and looking back I don't know why I didn't. I just froze. I was so fucking scared.\n\n \nGS was watching us that night, and we were alone with him. He touched me more the next morning while I pretended to sleep. I don't know what he did while I was actually sleeping.\n\n \nThe same day after dropping me off, GS texted me and thanked me. Something like \"Thanks for the cuddles last night! It was a lot of fun :)\" I deleted the message after my brain kind of turned into white noise.\n\n\n \n\nI didn't tell my parents because they were terribly abusive and batshit insane (on meth, drinking, etc), but I did tell JE less than\/about a week later, I wanted her to be aware and stay away from him. I said to her- my parents can't find out, don't tell anyone, but she did end up telling BR about it.\n\n \nHere's where things get confusing and fuzzy. \n\n \nBR told her dad, and her dad confronted GS who admitted to it and said \"we were just having a little fun.\" BR's dad told BR's mom (MM) who then contacted the police.... JE told me to prepare for a cop to come to my house and ask about it. Before then, MM asked me to come to her house and talk. JE and I went over and she pulled me upstairs. She begged me to press charge because\/and that GS had done this before. I said no, I just wanted it all to go away.\n\n \nA bit after the incident, a cop came to my house and questioned me about it. Told me it was my duty to press charges so he couldn't do it to more girls. I declined. He obviously had to tell my parents. After, my parents never spoke a word about it to me. I don't know much about what happened after.\n \nNow I am ready to press charges. I've researched it as much as I can but I can't find anything conclusive. I think the penal code is 243.4 for sexual battery of a child 16+. Or maybe PC 288 (a) for molestation of a minor.\n\n \nI contacted MM 3 years ago explaining this to her and she said that they did manage to get GS charged with violation of parole and he spent some time in jail. I have asked her multiple times over the years to give me any info possible but I think she is kind of avoiding it. So, I'm at a loss.\n  \n  \n \n  \n~TL;DR~\n\nSexual battery\/molestation at 16. I avoided the police and declined to press charges out of fear. 6 years later I am ready to press charges. \n \n \n~LEGAL ADVICE~\n \n \n  \nI want to know what I can do to make this happen. File a police report? Is it too late?\n \n \nI've read that you can:\n\n- Press charges for sex crimes involving a minor at any time\n\n- Press charges before 22 years of age (sexual battery)\n\n- Press charges before the 28th birthday (Sex crime involving minor)\n\nIt's hard to get a clear answer.\n\n \nIt's better to go in person to file a report right? Do I try to get in contact with the DA? \n\n \nPlease tell me what to do and what to expect.\n\n \nThank you so much for reading, any advice is appreciated.\n\nEdit: I'm sorry, I should have done more digging into past references regarding this before posting. I would like to add that when I did speak to MM, she also told me that GS admitted to molesting me and went back to jail for 2 years. Does this mean I can't press charges personally anymore? I don't know what this means legally.\n\nLast edit: I reached out to Rainn and was helped through their online chat and was put in touch with an advocate to help me through this process. Thank you all so very much, this has truly helped me.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"legaladvice","subreddit_id":"t5_2rawz","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/legaladvice","subreddit_subscribers":487925,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[CA] Sexual battery at 16, 6 years later I want to press charges.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/legaladvice\/comments\/8no7ts\/ca_sexual_battery_at_16_6_years_later_i_want_to\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Hey [r\/dirtyr4r](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtyr4r)! I'm 20, skinny\/fit, and a bit of a nerd. I'm a computer science major, and am a big fan of basically anything related to computers or video games. I'm also a fan of Netflix, Star Wars, and just hanging out with friends. I've never been the best at introductions, so if you have any questions for me just ask!\n\nKinkwise I'm a little switchy, but usually submissive. As a sub, I'm a big fan of tease\/denial, body worship, and bondage. My hard limits are heavy pain\\(blood, any permanent marks, etc.\\), urine\/scat play, and obviously anything illegal. As far as any anal type play goes, I've always had a bit of a pegging fantasy but have never done much with it. I have experience with an online domme, but have never done anything in real life. Right now I'm really open to trying new things right now, and have been curious about forced bi.\n\nWhat I'm looking for right now is a domme \\(either biologically female or trans\\) to help me try new things as a sub. I'd also be interested in being dominated by a couple. This couple really could have any power dynamic going, but I'd be most comfortable if there's at least one girl. This would preferably start online \\(I'd like to get to know you as a person!\\), but if you are close by I'd be interested in trying something in real life \\(If I've kept your interest this long and your not in the area feel free to message me though\\). Also, full disclosure I am currently in an open relationship. If you're interested or have any questions please pm me with a little about yourself!

I am Jack and I am 5'11, slim and In decent shape too I guess. My hair is a dark blonde and my eyes are blue. My cock grows to around 6.5 inches when fully erect. I started fantasising about older women nearly two years ago but recently the urges have become stronger and the fantasies have been wild. I'm a virgin and would just love to have some fun with a naughty, dirty older woman on here who knows exactly how to please a guy and his cock.... I would learn so much and be blown away by your skill...\n\nI will admit it, i simply love older women who are hungry for young cock, from the women I have spoke to in the past, its definitely the ones who simply love having a young body to play with that are the most fun so if you simply adore young guys, love the fact that you're a kinky cougar and arent ashamed to admit it then bonus points for you! One of the things i love about older women is their experience, they've mostly seen it all and done it all before and know just how to drive a young guy insane, if I was to be lucky enough to be with one then they'd give me standards that no one could live up to around my age.\n\nSome of my kinks include: Blowjobs, older women, being seduced, ass, anal, face sitting, spanking, lots of cum, dirty talk and women with experience. However, I would love to explore more and learn more about the things that get my teen dick so hard....\n\nI am open to most things and am happy to either chat or roleplay! A few ideas for roles if you wanted to roleplay are:\n\nYou are my mother's best friend.\n\nWe are neighbours.\n\nYou are my mom ;)\n\nWe meet at a hotel bar and we hit it off\n\nYou don't have to pick any of those, I am open to other ideas!

I first thought it declined because of being out of state so I had them try to run it again, then it turned out it was because of my credit limit.\n\nI did the math, 625 for a hour in dances, and 150 plus tax for the bottle, I have the bottle receipt.\n\nI tell dancer I can't afford that.

I pay the daner with that in cash after withdrawal from ATM.\n\nI have record of the withdrawal.\n\nI sign and fingerprint 3 documents before the dance.\n\nReceipt for the champage bottle. Which charged my credit card for the right amount.\n\nSome paper I didn't read (rules\/some mini contract I imagine, but my fear is that maybe I signed some sort of contract that obliges me to pay them some amount, or it\u2019s he purchase of credit or something, etc.)\n\nWhat I believe to be some carbon receipt of my card, but I\u2019m not sure though, I wrote in a tip amount the same as the champagne bottle, and only initialed, I think they misled me to believe this was something for the champagne receipt.\n\nMy fault for not checking what I was signing, but I was obviously drunk.\n\nI leave the club afterwards. I am not in club longer than a hour and half, and in the room for probably half a hour (what we agreed upon). I have uber receipts to prove how long I was there. \n\nIf the story ends here, I will be a happy person. This is the agreement I knowingly came to, and have paid for according to all charges.\n\nBut here I am 3 months later, and worried out of my mind I'm going to one day get a call from collections saying I owe them some absurd amount of money, some lawsuit from the club, and all that good debt collecting Jazz.\n\nI've been reading strip club scam horror stories and worried I'm next essentially. Stories of people owing $20,000 to clubs in NY and $90,000 to clubs in San Francisco for example. Even here on reddit of people being charged a couple grand.\n\nI've given up on trying to contact the club, I've kept record of the 5 times I've tried to get a hold of the manager for copies of receipts.\n\nI pay for my Expirian credit report, and so far no collection against my account. I monitor this daily for a collection account opening against me. Just something to settle my anxiety.\n\nI've gotten a new credit card, and so far the club hasn't charged my old card number outside of what I knowingly agreed to. I\u2019ve verified this with my card company, that no vendor has tried to charge that old card number after the fact. They also verified that I am not responsible for the declined charges ($790 twice).\n\nMy biggest fear is that I unknowingly signed some sort of credit from the club that they will send to collections or bill me for. I haven\u2019t heard anything from the club though in almost 3 months though.\n\nAm I over worrying? Is there somebody here that has worked in a club that knows?

I currently have a desk job, and by the time I get home I often just want to sit down, rest, and unwind instead of get on the bike.  I would like to be able to arrive at work, maybe change out of biking clothes into work clothes, and be ready to go. Some basic things I am looking for:\n\n**Cost:** ideally $3k or under, but I am willing to consider others\n\n**Size:** I am 6'7\", 290 LBS, so the bike needs to have large sizes and be pretty well built.\n\n**Power:** I am not fit, and I hope this will help me lose some weight that I gained while being unemployed. I am looking for good power and speed.\n\n**Range:** My commute is about 20 miles round trip, and I plan to use max assist on the way to work and less\/no assist on the way home to get a bit of a workout.\n\nI tested some bikes at a local shop, and the owner was very helpful finding bikes that would fit me. All the ones I tried had 20MPH motors, one from Bosch, Shimano, and Brose. Of those 3 I preferred the Brose as it felt the most powerful when I tested it, and the bike itself was really comfortable. It was on a Specialized Como 2.0 with a large frame. Because of this I am currently leaning towards the Specialized Como 3.0 (28mph motor) in the XL frame size.\n\nSince I am new to this scene, and the reviews for the Como seem to be really sparse given how new it is, I was hoping for any suggestions you have to offer.\n\n\n\nOh, and one other quick question. The spec sheet says for the front hub \"15mm thru-axle (axle not included)\", What does that mean? I assume it comes with a front axel of some kind, right? https:\/\/www.specialized.com\/us\/en\/turbo-como-3-0-650b\/p\/133847?color=240279-133847 ","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ebikes","subreddit_id":"t5_2si7q","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ebikes","subreddit_subscribers":11472,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Contemplating my first ebike for a work commute","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ebikes\/comments\/8nof2g\/contemplating_my_first_ebike_for_a_work_commute\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I'm not here to debate whether or not engineering technology is a good or comparable major to a regular engineering degree. For me, engineering technology was the right choice and if you're just going to say something along the lines of \"you will never be a real engineer\" or \"engineering technology is a useless degree\" then don't bother commenting. I'm 18 credit hours away from getting my bachelor's in mechanical engineering technology. I have my associate degree already, and I have a full time job as a draftsman at a company that manufactures industrial filters. I've been told that once I get my bachelor's, I'd be able to move up from a draftsman to an engineering role inside the company. My question is, is it still worth it to persue getting my PE? I've always intended to get my PE as a way to make my engineering technology degree more \"equivalent\" to a regular engineering degree in terms of qualifications, but if I get a role as an engineer at a somewhat large (about 50+ people with multiple million dollars in sales a year) would it even matter at that point or would the experience make up for that extra word at the end of my degree? \n\nP.s. I absolutely love the engineering technology program at my school. It was absolutely the right program for me over the engineering program for many reasons. That's not what this post is about. I just want to know if it's worth getting a PE or not in my position.

I haven't work-worked since 2015. When I did work in 2015 it lasted for 2 months and in that time I had 2 anxiety attacks that resulted in subsequent psych hospitalizations. In 2017 I volunteered at a cat shelter, which was significantly less pressure, but still every day it was time to go to the shelter and do what I needed to do I would end up having an anxiety attack.\n\nI've been applying for like 2-10 jobs a day for the past 11 or so months. When I get job interviews, I either go to them and have an anxiety attack during them, or right after them. That is, if I don't just entirely skip out on the interview because I just really don't have the energy to deal with another anxiety attack.\n\nI think it's just about not feeling qualified, but then like I'm totally qualified to be a student. So applying to colleges\/signing up for free classes should be totally chill experiences, right? I wish that were the case, both those things just end up with more anxiety attacks.\n\nI'm mostly just ranting but also I'm really very frustrated because my psychiatrist is not really trying me on any anxiety medications. Like when I was 16 I had xanax prescribed to me and it super helped, but then when I was 17 I was noncompliant with medications and was taken off of it. I've since moved. And aged 4 years. And my doctor just keeps trying anything except for xanax, and none of it is working for me (Actually now that I think about it he's just tried different doses and formulations of vistaril and none of them have worked lol).\n\nDo y'all have any advice? On how to deal with or avoid the anxiety attacks? Or on how to bring up to my psychiatrist that I really think xanax would be the best choice for me? (I'm like 99% sure the solution is to just buck up and do it because that's what my family keeps telling me to do but like it's so so difficult)\n\nHave a great day!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"mentalhealth","subreddit_id":"t5_2qirg","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/mentalhealth","subreddit_subscribers":61605,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"my anxiety is 100% holding me back and if anyone could share their experiences of anxiety getting better or advice for me even, that would be rad.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/mentalhealth\/comments\/8noko5\/my_anxiety_is_100_holding_me_back_and_if_anyone\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

We have sex around once every two weeks. \\(We see each other almost every day\\). The sex is okay but nowhere near close to what it was. When I bring that up, she's saying \"\\*\\*she didn't even like the sex before, she just did it so I would like her\".

My understanding is that they perform the mass spectrometry after a positive from the immunoassay, but only for the substances identified as positive from the screen.
