He's great. Sex is great.\n\nHe's always told me he loves my body, he's a butt man (I'm pear shaped), that he doesn't like skinny women (I'm not very thin), that he doesn't like fake boobs, that he doesn't like blue eyed blondes, etc. In short, that supposedly I'm the most beautiful, most perfect woman he's met.\n\nAnyway, a few days ago I was using his computer and I joked about finding porn and I did, but whatever, porn is porn. So he said he had nothing to hide, but I found some pics of some celebrities who have flat asses and huge boobs, who are blond, etc. I know it's petty but he lied about his preferences to sugar coat things for me. It sucks.\n\nHe also told me he had briefly dated a stripper because he used to frequent strip clubs a lot for a while, and that they met and went out a few times and had sex. He said that she had a \"normal body\" and that I'm much better looking, but I don't believe him. He said women is strip clubs here are just regular looking, nothing special but I checked their websites and the women are all skinny, big boobed (fake boobs mostly), and blonde. So again, he lied about them being regular looking women. Now I think the stripper he had sex with was probably way hotter than me. He said that after me, he's the hottest woman he's slept with.\n\nI know it's all very petty, but my ex boyfriend used to treat me like utter crap and used my body insecurities against me, he'd call me fat, he said my breasts were ugly, etc., and while I know my new boyfriend treats me like gold and my ex is a douche, so these issues are just mine and unrelated. But it still affects me a lot, because it's taken me a very long time to feel even remotely attractive and now I find out that the whole thing my boyfriend always told me about not liking \"stereotypical women with porn star bodies\" is a lie, too.\n\nNow I'm thinking about getting implants which is the biggest change I could make, going on a diet and a strict exercise plan (even though I work long hours). He says it's not necessary and that he doesn't like fake boobs, but I'm sure he's being polite. I hate my breasts. I don't feel like having sex with him. I'm a perfectionist. I know some of you may feel I'm being stupid, but really, you don't know what it's like to feel gross and trying to build up your confidence, feel safe with someone and then find out they have the same preferences as every other guy.\n\nAnyway, I don't know how to overcome this, especially since it's affecting me sexually.\n\n\n---   \n**tl;dr**: I'm 26/F, my boyfriend is 26/M.

So in September, I bit the bullet and bought the NZXT H440 at a local computer store. I knew that once I got the case, there was no turning back. I didn't want to rush it though. I knew that this was an experience to remember. The build is now complete and all that I have left to get is one or two thin bezel monitors.\n\nIf all you want to see is pictures, then [here](http://imgur.com/a/U7dBE) they are. Full disclosure: taken on an iPhone 5s.\n\nA little about me first. I am 17 years old and live in New Zealand. I have no expenses so saving money is easy at the moment. I'm lucky I guess, but I work for close to minimum wage in my school holidays at full time hours (easily 40 hours a week). I paid for everything listed below except for the G502 mouse which I asked my parents to get me for Christmas and the Xbox One controller which my parents randomly decided to pay for at the counter on Boxing Day. I choose good quality parts and relatively neutral colours. The price to performance of this build is bad; partly because I live in New Zealand but also because I spent a little extra out of personal preference for quality of life. I didn't need the case fans and fan controller (totaling just over $200) nor the expensive RAM with heatspreaders that probably don't do anything, but as a consumer, I wanted these things.\n\nType|Item|Price NZD|Notes\n:----|:----|:-----------|:----\n**CPU** | Intel Core i5-4690K | $320.00 | This was an easy choice for me. As a high school student, I have no need for the benefits of the i7-4790K because in reality this build is gaming orientated.\n**CPU Cooler** | Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO | $30.00 | Decided to get this before I splurge on a fancy cooler that isn't necessary. Holding 4.6 GHz at 1.29V stable so I won't be getting a new cooler any time soon. My friend actually had one unopened and wanted to get a CLC so I grabbed it off him for $30.00.\n**Motherboard** | Asus Z97-A | $229.00 | One of the cheapest reputable Z97 boards I could get in New Zealand. I didn't want to get one shipped here as they can be rather fragile, so I got it locally.\n**Memory** | Corsair Dominator Platinum 8GB DDR3 2133MHz | $179.22 | This was a quality of life decision. I would be paying upwards of $120 for a decent 8GB kit in NZ so I just splurged and grabbed this 2x4GB kit off Amazon.\n**Storage** | Samsung 840 EVO 250GB | $181.85 | Knew that there were firmware issues with this, but they were resolved before I had even installed mine, so I downloaded that straight away. The capacity seems about right because 120GB is just not enough, while I couldn't justify getting 500GB.\n**Storage** | Western Digital WD Blue 1TB | $73.60 | Basic. Storage of music, films, TV shows, and whatever else that doesn't need the speed of an SSD.\n**Video Card** | EVGA GeForce GTX 970 4GB FTW ACX 2.0 | $634.49 | I was going to get the EVGA SC but the yellow SC on the side would have bothered me too much. The FTW is the highest factory overclocked EVGA card (maybe the highest in the market?) but more importantly has a blue FTW on the side to match the EVGA accents.\n**Backplate** | EVGA GTX 970 Backplate | $36.62 | Why did this come separately EVGA? Seriously?\n**Case** | NZXT H440 | $218.99 | What can I say? I need to be able to look at my PC and a tacky plastic gaming case would not sit well with me. \n**Power Supply** | Corsair RM750 | $202.11 | The selection of reputable PSUs readily available in NZ is astoundingly poor. Had to order this off Amazon and just used a NZ standard cable instead of the US one that came with it.\n**Wireless Network Adapter** | TP-Link TL-WN725N | $15.56 | At the time of my build my desk was a few metres away from the ethernet port in my room (my house has ethernet outputs in each room and the room with the modem has ethernet inputs for each room, so basically I don't have to run cables along the floor). I grabbed this little USB because I would not tolerate an ugly green PCB sitting in my computer.\n**Case Fan** | Corsair SP120 PWM Quiet Edition Twin Pack | $46.68\n**Case Fan** | Corsair SP120 Quiet Edition Twin Pack | $44.58\n**Case Fan** | Corsair SP120 Quiet Edition | $27.87\n**Case Fan** | Corsair AF140 Quiet Edition | $33.75\n**Fan Controller** | NZXT GRID+ | $48.35\n**Keyboard** | Cooler Master QuickFire Rapid-i | $171.35 | My first mechanical keyboard. I went for Cherry MX browns and I'm glad I did because if these are quiet compared to blues, then blues must be obnoxiously loud. Haven't tried a rubber dome keyboard since so I can't tell you if the hype is justified.\n**Mouse** | Logitech G502 | $67.85 | Matches the GPU and doesn't look over the top.\n**Headphones** | Audio-Technica ATH-M50x | $211.55 | Not an audiophile, but still want some good quality headphones to use. These will get a lot of use at school because I am usually at school a good hour before classes start and take 40 minutes to travel home.\n**Controller** | Xbox One Controller | $45.00 | I was a console peasant. I had an Xbox 360 so the Xbox One controller feels much more comfortable to me than a Playstation 4 one. I mostly use this for various indie games and casual games that support controllers.\n | | **Total** |\n | Prices include shipping, taxes, and discounts | $2781.80 |\n","retrieved_on":1440991498,"ups":1,"permalink":"/r/TestMyPosts/comments/2qyub7/asd/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"default","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"asd","subreddit":"TestMyPosts","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1420071619","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.TestMyPosts"}

On one hand this explanation made sense to me but at the same time I feel somewhat disingenuous or like I possibly being a manipulative or bad person because my decision to be with someone is calculated and not based \"feelings\" as it would be for most while their decision is based on emotion and they are probably assuming my decision to be with them is based on the same thing when it is not.","permalink":"/r/aspergers/comments/2qyv1p/when_you_have_trouble_connecting_with_anyone_how/","link_flair_text":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"When you have trouble connecting with anyone how do you know if you're with the right person, and is it fair to make the decision to be with someone long term when you don't feel a connection if you aren't going to ever feel that with anyone","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.aspergers","subreddit":"aspergers","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1420072067"}

She also said something like \"why are you like this with me?\" (I treat her like I would treat any other person and I don't hear complaints with anyone else) \"it's not like I hit you or raped you or something\" and then I reminded her of various instances in which she either used violenced or threatened to, among them was a time in which she threatened to get the gun, she denied this (she's big on gaslighting, the two times I demonstrated to her beyond doubt that she had lied she just started bawling), and when I reminded her that this was in front of my uncle and that we could call him to find out, she suddenly changed her tune, and said \"well it's okay to hit kids to educate them, a parent can hit a child and it's their right\" Now, this was completely new. She was aways big on talking the talk of \"it's wrong to hit kids blabla, I don't know how people can do it\" in front of people, and until very recenty she always denied having put a hand on me until I called her out on it. Even if I already knew what she said meant nothing, something about her actually defending hitting kids provoked an intense reaction in me, I've been in bed since yesterday afternoon which is fairly unlike me, I'm usually over her tricks before she even begins her monologues but not this time.\n \nAt one point in her speech she always says something along the lines of \"I know I was a good mother, we were great parents, we did the best we could, we did a great job, our only mistake was being too loving, I've earnt feeling like a great mother blabla\" She does it with this tone and face that more or less asks \"am I wrong? am I wrong?\" it's almost comical. The past times when she has said this I told her that it's not for her to decide, a cook doesn't decide wether he is a good cook or not and his opinion is more or less irrelevant, it's the people who eat his food who decide. I also told her that the fact that she keeps repeating that she has done nothing wrong in front of me shows her constant need for reassurance, and demonstrates she's really insecure about it. I've never seen anyone lose it so badly at being called insecure, it was like a kid who starts crying when the bullies accuse him of crying a lot. Now, this has always stung a lot. Something about the person who to an extent ruined me and hurt me and terrorized me when I was the most vulnerable having this attitude of not only not apologizing, not only nost saying anything about it, but actually saying that not only has she not done anything wrong, she has done everything right and well and has a reason to feel good about how she was with me, absolutely obliterated me. I've found this right here is what hurts the most out of everything. This has always been the case, and I can usually get over it after a few minutes of thinking how at odds with reality her opinion is, but the fact that she defendd hitting kids put me in a vlunerable place and I just can't stop ruminating on this. \n\nNow here's where it gets worse. I'm 21, I live alone in another city (it's a long story) off of money that she gives me (inheritance she got off my dad). I don't have a job, I don't have even a high school diploma, and I know she will stop supporting me next December. I don't have a car either. I have all that to worry about. I now know I basically won't ever see my friends from this city in years because since she doesn't want me staying with her anymore I can't afford to come. I have to worry about that. I recently broke up with my ex and I just can't stop thinking about it and how much I miss her eventhough I wasn't happy in the relationship and it was me who shit it up. I don't know anyone in the city I live. My best friend moved to the UK to study and is too busy to talk consistently. I don't talk to family because I never really had a relationship with them, and I fear that if I open up with them whatever I share about my life will make it's way to my mom. I am careful of avoiding her knowing any of my hobbies or interests or thoughs or anything because when I was a kid and all I wanted was to make her happy and to share stuff that I thought was nice and relevant to my life with her because I was naive, I was only met with criticism, discouragement, harsh words, insults, mocking. Now add to that the fact that it's new year's eve and I'm gonna spend it in the room where I grew up in feeling bad because I just can't comprehend how the person who has done me the most harm, and that's a lot of harm, in my life doesn't even feel an iota of remorse, but in fact feels really quite good about herself, while I basically have nothing and have no one. \n\n\nI wold like to add that the fact that I've \"failed to thrive\" is not her fault. It's not my intention to delegate the responsibility of problems that I could have solved to other people. It's true that because of things my parents did to me and how they treated me and because my dad died when I was young, I've had to overcome more than what people usually have to overcome to get started in life, but it's still up to me to make something of myself. I think that's more empowering anyway.\n\nPlease talk to me. I'm lonely. Just saying that you read my post will help. Please don't feel the need to couch your words if you feel like you have something harsh to say that might be useful.

I am 17 years old and live in New Zealand. I have no expenses so saving money is easy at the moment. I'm lucky I guess, but I work for close to minimum wage in my school holidays at full time hours (easily 40 hours a week). I paid for everything listed below except for the G502 mouse which I asked my parents to get me for Christmas and the Xbox One controller which my parents randomly decided to pay for at the counter on Boxing Day. I choose good quality parts and relatively neutral colours. The price to performance of this build is bad; partly because I live in New Zealand but also because I spent a little extra out of personal preference for quality of life. I didn't need the case fans and fan controller (totaling just over $200) nor the expensive RAM with heatspreaders that probably don't do anything, but as a consumer, I wanted these things.\n\nI kept waiting for the next best thing to come, but I realised that the nature of this new found hobby is that there will always be bigger, better, faster, stronger products to come. So in September, I bit the bullet and bought the NZXT H440 at a local computer store. I knew that once I got the case, there was no turning back. I didn't want to rush it though. I knew that this was an experience to remember. The build is now complete and all that I have left to get is one or two thin bezel monitors.\n\nIf all you want to see is pictures, then [here](http://imgur.com/a/U7dBE) they are. Full disclosure: taken on an iPhone 5s.\n\nI've modified the PCPP code because I sourced parts from Amazon, Newegg, NZ retailers, my friend and whatnot. Prices are manually inputted for this reason.\n\nType|Item|Price NZD|Notes\n:----|:----|:-----------|:----\n**CPU** | Intel Core i5-4690K | $320.00 | This was an easy choice for me. As a high school student, I have no need for the benefits of the i7-4790K because in reality this build is gaming orientated.\n**CPU Cooler** | Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO | $30.00 | Decided to get this before I splurge on a fancy cooler that isn't necessary. Holding 4.6 GHz at 1.29V stable so I won't be getting a new cooler any time soon. My friend actually had one unopened and wanted to get a CLC so I grabbed it off him for $30.00.\n**Motherboard** | Asus Z97-A | $229.00 | One of the cheapest reputable Z97 boards I could get in New Zealand. I didn't want to get one shipped here as they can be rather fragile, so I got it locally.\n**Memory** | Corsair Dominator Platinum 8GB DDR3 2133MHz | $179.22 | This was a quality of life decision. I would be paying upwards of $120 for a decent 8GB kit in NZ so I just splurged and grabbed this 2x4GB kit off Amazon.\n**Storage** | Samsung 840 EVO 250GB | $181.85 | Knew that there were firmware issues with this, but they were resolved before I had even installed mine, so I downloaded that straight away. The capacity seems about right because 120GB is just not enough, while I couldn't justify getting 500GB.\n**Storage** | Western Digital WD Blue 1TB | $73.60 | Basic. Storage of music, films, TV shows, and whatever else that doesn't need the speed of an SSD.\n**Video Card** | EVGA GeForce GTX 970 4GB FTW ACX 2.0 | $634.49 | I was going to get the EVGA SC but the yellow SC on the side would have bothered me too much. The FTW is the highest factory overclocked EVGA card (maybe the highest in the market?) but more importantly has a blue FTW on the side to match the EVGA accents.\n**Backplate** | EVGA GTX 970 Backplate | $36.62 | Why did this come separately EVGA? Seriously?\n**Case** | NZXT H440 | $218.99 | What can I say? I need to be able to look at my PC and a tacky plastic gaming case would not sit well with me. \n**Power Supply** | Corsair RM750 | $202.11 | The selection of reputable PSUs readily available in NZ is astoundingly poor. Had to order this off Amazon and just used a NZ standard cable instead of the US one that came with it.\n**Wireless Network Adapter** | TP-Link TL-WN725N | $15.56 | At the time of my build my desk was a few metres away from the ethernet port in my room (my house has ethernet outputs in each room and the room with the modem has ethernet inputs for each room, so basically I don't have to run cables along the floor). I grabbed this little USB because I would not tolerate an ugly green PCB sitting in my computer.\n**Case Fan** | Corsair SP120 PWM Quiet Edition Twin Pack | $46.68\n**Case Fan** | Corsair SP120 Quiet Edition Twin Pack | $44.58\n**Case Fan** | Corsair SP120 Quiet Edition | $27.87\n**Case Fan** | Corsair AF140 Quiet Edition | $33.75\n**Fan Controller** | NZXT GRID+ | $48.35\n**Keyboard** | Cooler Master QuickFire Rapid-i | $171.35 | My first mechanical keyboard. I went for Cherry MX browns and I'm glad I did because if these are quiet compared to blues, then blues must be obnoxiously loud. Haven't tried a rubber dome keyboard since so I can't tell you if the hype is justified.\n**Mouse** | Logitech G502 | $67.85 | Matches the GPU and doesn't look over the top.\n**Headphones** | Audio-Technica ATH-M50x | $211.55 | Not an audiophile, but still want some good quality headphones to use. These will get a lot of use at school because I am usually at school a good hour before classes start and take 40 minutes to travel home.\n**Controller** | Xbox One Controller | $45.00 | I was a console peasant. I had an Xbox 360 so the Xbox One controller feels much more comfortable to me than a Playstation 4 one. I mostly use this for various indie games and casual games that support controllers.\n | | **Total** |\n | Prices include shipping, taxes, and discounts | $2781.80 |\n\n"}

{"media":null,"selftext":"Hey everyone,\n\nI think I've only ever written two posts on reddit before, so I'm not super certain how this typically goes, but I found this sub a few days ago--just in time for the new year and a change in my terrible spending habits. I'm not sure how specific this should be, but I guess part of this is to keep myself accountable, so I'll try to be as detailed as possible.\n\nA little background: I'm 25 and a graduate student heading into my last semester in school. I started wearing makeup my very last semester of high school and bought a ton during my first year of college. At first I was into experimenting, but after awhile I started to tone it down, and I'm at an age and place in my life now where I really just want to keep my makeup natural, meaning I have tons of almost-untouched eye shadows in colors I will never wear again. This past year I went absolutely **insane** with lip products, as in I probably tripled the number I had. I also subscribed to two different beauty boxes, which left me with quite a few deluxe samples and even full-sized products that I won't use or used only briefly.\n\nAs I'm finishing up grad school and preparing to move across country again, I'd really like to start saving up money and getting rid of some of the clutter I've accumulated, and I want to start with makeup. So here's my plan for 2015:\n\n* No-buy until May 8, 2015, when I will allow myself to spend $150 at Ulta. The 8th is both my birthday and my graduation day, and I want to reward myself for finishing school and also earn some double points at Ulta during my birthday month. After that, back on a no-buy until November 26th, 2015.\n\n* I will still buy things such as shampoo, conditioner, and moisturizer as I need them, but only if/when I run out of what I already have (including beauty box samples, foils, etc). If I run out of my new foundation, I will use the spare I have of my old Bare Minerals. I should have enough of everything else (primers, mascaras) to last me. \n\n* After I receive my January bag, I will unsubscribe from ipsy. It's been a good six months, but I need to work through what I already have. I'll keep my Birchbox subscription, and I will allow myself to buy from the Birchbox store only if I have enough points built up to pay for the item in full.\n\n* When I return home after the holidays, I will go through my entire makeup stash and get rid of everything I don't use. I will be strict about it. Even if I love that blue Stila shadow, I know I won't wear it and it has to go. I'll sell what I can on MUE and the rest I will either give away or toss.\n\n* The money I make from destashing will go straight into my savings account. The makeup I do keep will get documented in a spreadsheet so that I can keep track of what I own and identify dupes and things that I am missing and need to invest in after my no-buy.\n\n* I will work to get through as many empties as possible each month and post them here on the first of each month (beginning with February).\n\nI think that's it for now. Thanks to everyone for the inspiration from your own plans. I'm really glad to have found this sub, and I'm excited to start fresh for the new year!","retrieved_on":1440991480,"ups":13,"permalink":"/r/MakeupRehab/comments/2qyvrk/cheshirecatdss_plan_for_2015/","link_flair_text":"Plan","distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","title":"cheshirecatds's Plan for 2015","secure_media_embed":{},"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MakeupRehab","created_utc":"1420072539","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MakeupRehab","hide_score":false,"quarantine":false,"score":13,"edited":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupRehab/comments/2qyvrk/cheshirecatdss_plan_for_2015/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"created":1420072539,"subreddit_id":"t5_32g1x","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"author":"cheshirecatds","from":null,"is_self":true,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"num_comments":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"id":"2qyvrk","link_flair_css_class":"plantwo","name":"t3_2qyvrk","gilded":0}

The first thing the youngest girl says when she walks in the door is \"I want a COKE!\" to my father. I run and fetch her a drink as per my dad's request. I look over and the older two boys (7 and 9) have fired up my Xbox One and have selected Forza. They are trying to use DLC cars, and I tell them this. \"Well why don't you buy them?\", I explain to them I don't want or need this DLC. They are upset. I come back and the youngest have gotten into the party horns. They decide it would be fun to non-stop blow them. Yay.  I walk up to my room and the youngest girl asks \"Wheres the cat?\" I reply saying I have no idea, to which she replies \"Well, you should find him for me\". wat. This is all in the first 45 minutes of them arriving.\n","media":null,"ups":17,"retrieved_on":1440991471,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":12,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2qywfa","archived":true,"id":"2qywfa","from":null,"author":"128keaton","is_self":true,"from_id":null,"created":1420072976,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qtwb","from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/2qywfa/happy_new_years_rant/","stickied":false,"edited":false,"score":17,"quarantine":false}

{"retrieved_on":1440991464,"ups":13,"media":null,"selftext":"I've been depressed and lonely for the majority of my life and it only recently that I decided to start taking measures to improve myself to try and remedy them. The primary cause of my depression is loneliness most especially a lack of romantic connections so I am trying to do things that will improve my success with women specifically (I'm male, if that matters). I've started an exercise routine (combo of lifting weights and cardio), started dieting to a calorie counting level of meticulousness, began teaching myself a second language, started programming, drawing, reading a lot more (minimum of a book a week) and both putting myself out there by reaching out to friends and by being more centered, relaxed and confident in social interactions. And while I know all of that is good and proper as a start to self-improvement that will take much patience and consistency before I see tangible results, I can not help, but have a lingering fear it will all be for nothing. \n\nI will start with my physical appearance since I believe that has the greatest impact on the initial stages of romance. I am 25, 5'9 and currently weigh 206 lbs and not muscular. My sex life is non-existent outside of what I do with my hand. Every girl I've ever liked or tried to be with in any form has rejected me except for 1. Given my incredible level of failure and since it always happens before even a first date, I have to conclude that I am ugly. I am trying to get in better shape in hopes that I will be on a level to attract women I find attractive, but I am afraid that it won't be enough. I am afraid that my underlying bone structure, facial features and body composition and potential will make me unable to cross a certain threshold of physical attractiveness (let's say 7 or 8 on a scale of 1-10 just so you can imagine it in general) and that being unable to cross that threshold will make me unable to have the sort of sex life I want to have. This terrifies me as it would mean that all the work and my maximum capacity was not good enough to achieve my goals and I won't even be able to lose my virginity to someone I want to lose it to let alone have consistent romantic and sexual relations with attractive women.\n\nI realize that while looks are tremendously important they will not maintain a person's interest especially not someone with depth and beauty beyond the physical. For that reason, as well as generally wanting to be a more skilled and fulfilled individual, I am trying to expand my hobbies and competences. My fears with these are similar to what I mentioned before: I fear I will never reach a level of quality that I can be unreservedly proud of and I fear that none of them will translate to any social success or recognition. \n\nI understand that these may be a common fears and that a lot of these sorts of things are supposed to be done for my own sake and, while they are, I would be lying if I said I am not thinking in terms of gaining more acceptance from others by self-actualizing in these ways. \n\nI don't know what exactly I'm looking for posting this, but I know I'd for some sort of advice, guidance or insight. I also know that I definitely don't want to live if I maximize my potential in these domains and it's not good enough to get what I want out of life. Life like I've known it is just not worth it and while I am open to almost any idea, I am not open to someone telling me, in whatever way, how I ought to define a life worth living for myself.","permalink":"/r/self/comments/2qywxg/im_terrified_ill_always_be_an_ugly_lonely_loser/","link_flair_text":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"I'm terrified I'll always be an ugly, lonely, loser.","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.self","subreddit":"self","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1420073338","quarantine":false,"score":13,"edited":1420073699,"stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh96","from_kind":null,"created":1420073338,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2qywxg/im_terrified_ill_always_be_an_ugly_lonely_loser/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null,"is_self":true,"author":"AllOrDeath","from":null,"archived":true,"id":"2qywxg","name":"t3_2qywxg","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":4}

I'm feeling pretty good right now. This is my first stimulant apart from caffeine.\n\nCome-up was nice and slow, little rush at one point after I got up and moved around.\n\nJust sorta chillin' watching The Cleveland Show on Netflix. My ceiling fan is kinda funky looking but it might be just because it the only thing in focus (no glasses on, it's just at my distance limit).\n\nTyping is kinda odd. Keep messing up and having to retype stuff.\n\n10/10 so far. Will update more as trip (not really a trip is it? Just kinda energetic) goes on.\n\nEdit 1: feeling much less jumpy and rushy than before. Feeling nice though. Feeling very talkative and friendly. Messaging lots of people. Legs feel like jelly but still able to walk fine. Pupils are significantly dialated.\n\nEdit 2: Strangely, I'm nodding off a lot. Like deep asleep every little while. Super vivid dreams, literally no recollection of them when I wake up. I'm probably gonna attribute this to my huge lack of sleep from last night. Only got about 5 hours worth of decent sleep. Still feel pretty good though. Maybe a little sweaty but not too uncomfortable.\n\nEdit 3: Thinking I'll call this sober. No longer jittery, don't feel energized, was able to sleep for a decent stretch of time. I'd call the duration about 3hrs. My weight is 260lbs and I'm 5' 10\". Will try a larger dose next time. Probably 180mg or so.\n\nOverall, would rate 4-FA a 9/10. The rush was nice on the comeup, the dose is small so it's cheap enough to enjoy when I want to. Definitely think this could be used to focus not just have fun. Duration is nice. 3hrs is nothing that can't be managed.\n\nMay try a smaller dose next time and see if it can just be stimulating but not euphoric.\n\nWill also try large dose to see if it's more rushy/party-drug style high.\n\nMay try combined with a half tab of AL-LAD. 60-80mg + 1/2tab (75ug) after more research.\n\nFeeling really cold. Temp control seems to be important for this drug. Hydration is also important, mouth is dry as fuck.","media":null}

I'll give some background on our relationship, but if you want to skip to today's event, you can skip to the bolded part.\n\nMy father has never really been in my life as much as I think a father should. Him and my mother separated like 15 years ago, but kept a civil and pretty good relationship for my sake, I suppose. I am my mother's only child, and my father's only girl. We did not have a good relationship until maybe 2013 when I was going through some tough issues. I ended up in psychiatric hospitals for episodes (later diagnosed as bipolar/psychosis) and he came to visit me. I hadn't seen him in three years, and when I saw him I didn't even recognize him. It was so good to know that he was there to support me through a tough time. \n\nMy father is an extremely intelligent man. He has a great knowledge of the universe and other esoteric things. Certain topics I cannot not talk with my mom (politics, government, etc.), he is more than willing to discuss and enjoys it. We have been building a better relationship since 2013, talking every day and if not texting. On the flip side, my father can be an immature asshole. I know why my mother never wants to get back together with him. He can be very ignorant, blunt, and just overall fucking annoying. Sometimes everything is a fucking joke to him. He has a lot of good advice to offer, but sometimes he just comes across as an ass.\n\nMy father currently lives (imo) as a hermit. He lives in an extremely small part of his state and the biggest city near him is about an hour away. None of his family lives here. He wakes up, goes to work, comes home, eats, and goes to bed. He drinks, every single day. Moonshine, vodka, wine, you name it. I knew he drank, but I didn't realize how much until I started being around him for longer periods of time. Earlier this year, he came up to visit my state and stayed for a week. He drank every day he was there. I drank with him and my mother. I realized that I have a tendency to drink more when I'm around him. I have a history of alcohol abuse and should not be touching alcohol at all because I am one of those \"can't drink just to get buzzed, have to get drunk\" people. I went to AA a couple of times. I realize I have a problem, one that I will have to manage for the rest of my life. Another issue that my parents have is that I take medication for bipolar disorder and mixing alcohol and prescription pills is no bueno. I realize this and sometimes break the rules, but generally I have stopped drinking while taking the meds. Like I said, when I am around him, I have a tendency to drink more because he is always drinking.\n\n**Tonight's Events**\n\nI don't know who ruined New Year's, me, him, or both, but I am livid right now. He was in the kitchen making some food when I came in to get some. He grabs my shoulder and looks me square in my eye, about 2 feet apart from me and says \"I'm worried about you\" with this very smug, angry, \"I-know-it-all\" look on his face. I say I'm fine. He says \"You drink too much, you smoke too much (I smoke cigarettes, but my NY resolution is to quit and he knows that).\" At this point in our relationship I am feeling VERY uncomfortable with him being so close to me. I honestly do not think of my dad as being creepy or weird, but sometimes it just feels unnatural being so close to him. So, I try to get his hand off my shoulders as I am feeling weird about him being so close, and say \"Dad, don't talk to me like a child.\" and he tells me to shut up! I become irate and tell him not to tell me to shut up. I feel angry so I go to take a swig from the beer I was nursing (the beer *he* bought and asked me if I would drink it), and he states \"That's your problem right there.\" I don't say anything, but leave the kitchen and go in my room and lock the door.\n\nThe reason I am angry is he is a fucking hypocrite. He drinks every. single. day. I am sure of it. He was at one time a smoker, but quit because of losing teeth, and oral cancer I believe. He knows how hard it is to quit smoking, but basically told me this whole week I \"can't do it because it's the hardest thing in the world to do\" and will frequently make jokes or make me feel bad about smoking. He makes me feel like I can't quit. Isn't a parent supposed to motivate and support their child trying to better themselves? I told him this and he said, yes *but* I don't think you can do it.\n\nAnyways. I am sitting here in my room, still pissed off. The entire night is ruined (my dad mentioned we would be having champagne! Great idea, Dad, for two alcoholics!), my mom being the passive person she is just went to her room. I locked my door a couple times and she kept coming in to ask me about things not related to the incident. Nothing to comfort me or even scold me. Nothing.\n\nI don't know what I'm asking for but I have no one else to talk to. I think once everyone (myself included) calms down, we will be able to talk it out, but he struck a nerve with me. I am 26-years-old, and I will listen to their advice, but ultimately I will make my own decisions. I hate being treated like a child. I know I don't need to drink. I know I need to stop smoking. For him to try and be a dad NOW after all these years is baffling to me. And not only that, but to tell me *I* have an issue when you're drinking everyday?!\n\nSorry if I ruined *your* New Years. Just looking for some insight. My dad and I have never really \"fought\" before, but this is totally different. I love my dad, but not when he's trying to be controlling, borderline verbally abusive, and hypocritical. Right now I am angry, but my suicidal feelings are creeping in again. I have that \"limbo\" feeling like, I don't want to kill myself, but I don't want to be here anymore. I just want to vanish like a puff of smoke. I feel very upset, but I can't cry. I leave tomorrow for my own state thank god.\n\nThanks for listening. And sorry for the length. I hope 2015 is a better year for everyone.\n\n---   \n**tl;dr**: A ruined NYE. Dad tries to be a dad after years of not being there, telling me I drink too much even though he is an alcoholic and has been for years. Tells me to shut up.

I don't know what it is wrong with me.\nI'm going to have to divulge some personal info which is embarrassing but if it helps diagnose whatever is wrong with me, so be it.\n\nI am a 36 year old male.  Always been healthy and fairly active.  I played sports in high school but not so much after.  I took up smoking cigarettes and pot and partying a lot when I turned 19.  Throughout my 20s, I wasn't nearly as active as I was in my teens but I still didn't show any effects of it.  I continued to smoke, drink and party.\n\nThis lasted until about 29 when I gave up that weekend warrior lifestyle and lived a quieter lifestyle.  However, I started living pretty bad.\n\nAround 30-31 I was laid off of my job.  My girlfriend left me.  I lost my apartment, my car.  I also lost a bunch of friends.  I moved back home and felt sorry for myself and decided to \"take some time off\" and live how I wanted.\n\nI used to work a lot and I was eager to just sit around and take a rest.\nI think I overdid it.  I started playing video games.  I played video games excessively.  I played video games from the moment I woke up until the moment I slept.  This would be about 16 hours a day.  Not only that, but I started smoking pot again, almost ritualistic.  I also smoked cigarettes a lot.  I ate absolute garbage.  I also ate whenever I wanted.  I would eat a whole big bag of jelly beans, wash it down with soda pop, maybe eat a bag of popcorn or potato chips and continue to smoke cigarette after cigarette, IN MY ROOM mind you, all while smoking lots of pot and sometimes not even sleeping at all.  I was basically under the control of pot/smokes/games/junkfood.\n\nThe only time I would leave the house was if I ultimately had to and that was usually for more pot/smokes/junk/games.\n\nAll I wanted to do was play video games.  I knew what I was doing was bad but I also kept telling myself \"just one more weekend.\"  That led into endless weeks/months and years.\n\nI broke free once or twice.  But not completely.  I remember losing my pot connection so I was forced to quit.  But then I just compensated by smoking more cigarettes.  I was still eating like crap and playing videos games non-stop.\n\nEventually I found another pot connection and I kept at it: pot/games/smokes/junk/terrible sleeping.\n\nSometimes I would even play games for 35 hours straight, with bathroom/food breaks.  Sleep 8 to 10 hours then get up and play another 30.  I haven't done that too much, but if you averaged my daily routine from 2010-2014, it would be games 12 hours a day, and all of those bad habits I keep mentioning.\n\nI became super moody.  Super depressed.  Like a zombie.  I knew I needed to stop but I couldn't because I always enjoyed a smoke here n there.  I always enjoyed video games especially and with my social life drying up, moving back home and having no job, video games were always something to pass the time.  And the pot was always fun, never a problem.  All three together, to me, was a good night!\n\nBut I took it to extreme levels.  I know this.  I never cared about my diet because I have always been fit.  Or at least \"fit\" looking.  I'm 6'2, always been about 185lbs-190lbs.  At the most, I developed a tiny \"skinny guy gut.\"  But, it was nothing I couldn't just work off in a week or two of exercise.\n\nIn 2013, I said enough is enough.  I stopped smoking everything, I stopped playing video games.  I went to the gym.  I tried to sleep better.  I got out of the house and took a course.  But then I found myself sneaking a smoke every once in a while.  Quitting didn't work.  In fact, maybe a week not even and I was smoking again.  It's hard to stay on the good path when you're still smoking.  Anyway, I also \"rewarded\" myself by getting more pot and playing video games after I completed my course.  That was not smart.  Before long, I was right back in the same cycle.  Gaming, not sleeping good, smoking pot, smoking cigarettes and eating anything I wanted.  A lot of chips, pop and candy.  And I wouldn't even eat meals for days or weeks.\n\nFast forward to this past fall.  I realized that enough IS REALLY ENOUGH.  I also realized I cannot \"reward\" myself with garbage.  I also decided to admit to myself, as embarrassing as it may sound, that I had a nasty addiction to those things I listed.  By making a stance like that, and telling those close to me, I knew that I would make it real and something I had to deal with.  I used to keep it to myself.  Hardly anybody knew what my lifestyle was like besides my family I shared home with.\n\nI knew I had to cold turkey everything and make a stand.\nI quit smoking cigarettes cold turkey as well as pot cold turkey.  In turn, that made me not want to play video games, which was always a fear of mine because I needed them all in order to do any.  If that makes any sense.  I couldn't play video games without pot, and I needed smokes after I got stoned.  Blah blah.  I quit it all.\n\nAlthough, I did manage to play video games still.  To my surprise!  Just normally this time.  Maybe an hour or two here n there.  But I wasn't obsessed with them anymore.  I only had pot fits for the first day or two.  After that, I was fine.  The cigarettes call out to me every once in a while, especially when I'm stressed, but I know I am stronger than the addiction.  And I am proud to say I am still cold turkey on smokes/pot/obsessive gaming for nearly a month.\n\nMight not sound like a lot, but for me to even go a day without any of that is MASSIVE.  I couldn't function without those things before and if I had to, due to money or whatever reason, I would be in a nasty mood and I would try to sleep through it in order to \"pass time.\"   \n\nI'm fine now.   Although my sleep pattern hasn't corrected itself totally yet.  I'm still up a little late at night and a little late to wake in the morning but it's not nearly as bad as it was.  I expected to have to battle this but figure it'll level out soon.\n\nI still eat not so great.  But I'm working on it.  I always like fruit and veggies and still ate them all of this time, but not enough.  I eat them a lot more now.  I drink a lot of water now too.  I try to have breakfast and get nutrition that I was missing before.\n\nMy problem though, which is why I am here asking and I'm sorry if you had to read all of this.....is I'm TIRED.  I am so tired.  Everyday.  And this was happening for the past few years.  I even went to the Doctor in 2013 and they said I had low B vitamins or whatever.  They gave me a shot, told me to come back.  (I did, but I only went back once and it was months later).  I guess I should look back into that and get those shots.   But they said I was fine.\n\nIn other words, I didn't get an answer.  I guess I did, but I didn't follow through with the B shots.  However, this seems bigger than that.\n\nI'm healthy, as far as I know.  I've had my blood checked a few times over the past few years and I'm good. \n\nI'm still super tired though.  And at this age, there is no way I should be this tired.  I could sleep at 9pm or 10pm, good night sleep, comfy and wake up at 8 am or something.  Have breakfast, healthy.  Exercise and out and about....but then the moment I get inside, my body is so tired.  My eyes super heavy.  I just wanna nap.  And I do.  I'm afraid to sit down because I get so tired.\n\nNot only that, but I look weathered.  I have hated taking pictures for so long now because I have what seems like a yellow tinge under my eyes, I'm pale.  I look worn out.  Nobody ever tells me this though.  As if it's in my head.  But I see it when I take pics.  I used to look fresh and crisp.  I realize I'm older now, but I shouldn't be this worn feeling and looking.\n\nMy question is....can sitting inside, in front of the computer screen or tv for 12-18 hours a day (or more) , eating junk food at all hours, smoking cigarettes A LOT, and lots of POT, basically stoned the entire time I'm awake, as well as not exercising or eating meals, or sleeping good .....can that make me tired like I am?  Can that make me look like a corpse as I feel I look like?\n\nI am pretty sure the answer is yes.  But I've really turned around my habits.  Is it because it's only been not even a month since I've been cleaner opposed to 4 years of abuse to my body?  Do I need to stick with my healthy changes for longer to start to see/feel any improvements?\n\nPlease, whenever I type in my symptoms in Google, I get a lot of crazy results that always end with \"go see doctor.\"\n\nI run a km a few times a week on the treadmill.  I exercise in other ways by doing pushups and situps.  I drink lots of water, eat granny smith apples, carrots, fruit smoothies.  I still eat chips and pop and cookies but that's next on my list to get rid of.  Cold turkey smokes/pot and I don't stay up til sunrise anymore.  (but still late, like 2am, 4am)\n\nIf anybody knows anything, your input is immensely appreciated.\n\nThank you\n\n\n","retrieved_on":1440991435,"ups":3,"permalink":"/r/nutrition/comments/2qyz6i/what_is_wrong_with_me_could_it_be_because/","link_flair_text":null}
{"selftext":"I just got my first Third Class Medical slash Student Pilot Certificate today and thought I would share my experience in case anyone was nervous about what to expect.\n\nI'm generally in good health, but I had surgery on my eye at the age of 4 (I'm 31 now) to correct strabismus, so I was fairly nervous about getting the medical.  I found an ophthalmologist AME because I figured that was my best shot at not getting a deferral.  I figured he'd see the details of the surgery and know it wasn't a big deal as long as my eyes still work correctly.\n\nI arrived at the doctor's today with my FAA Form 8500-8 in hand and the confirmation number I got from MedXPress.  After I submitting my driver's license and signing HIPPA disclosures I was handed a cup for the urinalysis.  Apparently all that is checked for is the presence of albumin (a sign of kidney problems) and glucose (a sign of diabetes).  The nurse then took my height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse.  Next up were the eye tests: visual acuity (Snellen chart) and color blindness (Ishihara test), also conducted by the nurse.\n\nSoon after the doctor came in.  We chatted a bit as he read over the nurse's notes and I told him about my surgery and nervousness about it.  He laughed and said that for a third class medical strabismus isn't even a concern.  Joy.  Never the less, he did check to see if my problem was still resolved (it was) and then checked my retinas.  Satisfied that my eyes are in good working order, he moved on to some neuromotor tests involving pushing and pulling his hand with my hands, my legs, and my toes, and then squeezing his fingers with my hands.  I had indicated on my MedXpress form that I have seasonal allergies and was diagnosed with mild asthma as a child, so he then checked my lung sounds for issues (none found, apparently).\n\nWe chatted a little more, he made some notes on the MedXpress website, and then printed me off my new medical slash student certificate.\n\nAll in all, I think I was at the office for 30 minutes and only about 15 of them were spent with the doctor.  The cost was $125.","media":null,"ups":3,"retrieved_on":1440991434,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/flying/comments/2qyza4/faa_third_class_medical_writeup/","downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"FAA Third Class Medical write-up","secure_media_embed":{},"created_utc":"1420075029","author_flair_text":"PPL ASEL (KDPA)","media_embed":{},"subreddit":"flying","domain":"self.flying","hide_score":false,"score":3,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/2qyza4/faa_third_class_medical_writeup/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"created":1420075029,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qm1t","stickied":false,"from":null,"author":"kdknigga","is_self":true,"num_comments":7,"author_flair_css_class":"ppl","saved":false,"over_18":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_2qyza4","archived":true,"id":"2qyza4"}

I didn't know where to turn to so I thought \"why not ask a bunch of strangers on the internet to help me out\" okay, so I had a boyfriend this last year, our relationship started last December and it was one of the best expiriances of my entire life. It was one of those things when you just know it's right. I'm 18 years old, I have really young parents. (Yes I was an accident) during the course of our relationship my life began to fall apart, I will spare you the sob stories. Just know that everything kind of just turned to shit, so I ran to him as a safety and he knew what he was getting himself into. He was always there for me, he never told me he loved me, but I knew. He didn't have to say it. I could just tell. We did everything together. People knew us not as Shelby or Chandler it was Shelby AND Chandler. Anyway, so he graduated. I was a year under him. And he went off to college. He wasn't too far. But I was still so heartbroken, the last month of our relationship was so awful and miserable for the both of us because I was so afraid of losing him to college, I knew it was going to happen I just never wanted it to. We both knew what was best, but a month before we were suppose to break up, he left me. He said I was too insecure. And I was just in pieces. We fought, yelled, and cried that whole day. Then we didn't talk at all for 6 months. In that 6 months I went to therapy, stayed in my choir and got a job. I felt like things were going right. I was growing up and becoming a better person. I still thought about him everyday though making sure he was okay and trying to imagine him having a great time In college.\nHis mom calls me frequently asking how I am and telling me about all of his expiriances and I love that. I love his family. I love him. The real reason I'm on here isn't to just give you this story but for the past week chandler all of a sudden contacted me (which is not like him AT ALL) and he misses me, he tells me it's an addiction. And that everyone he meets gets compared to me, and that he thinks about me all the time. This isn't like him. At all. He is very rational and not emotional. He basically poured his heart out to me the first night, then the past couple nights we stay up and talk till 5 or 6 In the morning. It's not all about our relationship either, sometimes it's just about all the stupid stuff. We both have tickets to a music festival and all of our mutual friends are going together, we are terrified to see each other. So guys.. Do you think it's possible that maybe it could all work out? It's a typical high school relationship story I know but I'm so desperate. I cry when he hangs up, but then he calls me back always and says he wasn't done... Please please help me.

I'm 6 months out of college and fortunately have a good-paying job to get a nice car. My absolute hard upper limit is $35k but I would like to get it for ~$30 if possible. I want a powerful, fun car and I don't care too much about MPG unless it's really abysmal. I would like a coupe rather than a a roadster but if it has a hardtop then I could be OK with it (also I live in CA so it would be nice to let the top down sometimes). Here's what I've been looking at. Years vary depending on the car, but I would preferably like to get '08 or newer.\n\n1. **BMW Z4 sDrive35i** - This is one of my dream cars if I'm being honest. After all, it is the ultimate driving machine. I'm in love with the styling and the signature beemer twin turbo. The hardtop really appeals to me and I like having the option to keep it down when the weather's nice. Also '09 is the year of the redesign too and it's definitely in my price range. \n2. **Chevy Corvette** - This one's something I've seen in countless video games and always wanted to have one. My only problem with it is that I can't seem to find many in my area. The ones that I do either have a lot of miles or are ~10 years old.\n3. **Porsche Cayman or 911** This is sort of a stretch but I am willing to bend my rules a bit if I can drive a mother 'effin Porsche to work everyday! Sure it would be older and/or more used than other cars on the list but the styling can't be beat IMO. 911 would be amazing too since it has the added utility of the back seats. \n\nSo what should I go for? Moreover, what other cars should I be looking at in this range? I know the SLK is one of them but the styling of the pre-2012's doesn't really appeal to me as much. The Miata and S2000 are also out of the question because I'm not a fan of soft tops at all. Also I didn't really mention this but which ones on this list would have the worst reliability?\n\nThank you!","media":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.whatcarshouldIbuy","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1420077415","subreddit":"whatcarshouldIbuy","media_embed":{},"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Upper limit of $30-35k for a fun, used sports car.

I'm 25 and am visiting my parents for the holidays. \n\nMy mother was always the breadwinner and takes complete care of the household. My father basically treats her like shit. It \"isn't abuse\" because he doesn't hit her, but basically he isolates her from every one else and she has no friends. He is demanding and an all-round general asshole as a person. He is also not the sharpest knife in the drawer. Over the past five years he has now become afraid of me because I scream back at him (this is not like me at all around anyone else...I'm known to be ridiculously patient) even though I'm supposed to feel sorry for him. I can't. I'm usually a very empathetic person; I know this because I have a large circle of friends and family who feel comfortable telling me things they would never tell anyone else. Unfortunately, I can't be empathetic with him and now I'm losing that empathetic part of me slowly with everyone (especially with men). I'm finding that I'm having trouble controlling myself around him because his relationship with my mother is getting worse.  In fact, I swear that if he ever tries to hit me or her, I will probably kill him. This anger is starting to terrify me because it is so out of character. I'm starting to feel like it's my job to protect my mother but this is a burden I can't handle--I wish she would just leave him of her own accord. In our traditional Indian family arranged marriages were the norm; their marriage was arranged and she refuses to get a divorce because her family will disown her if she does. It infuriates me and affects me to a point where I'm finding myself hating men although I think that's wrong and I don't like generalizing this to all men.  It is keeping me from forming relationships--I always stop talking to a man after the second date and/or after we've had sex. It is so bad that I stop answering their messages and/or phone calls because \"I know that the man only wanted sex anyway\". That's horrible and I need/want to stop because I can imagine how hurt they must be if they actually had actually liked me. Slowly, I'm losing the ability to have any feelings other than rage at all. I hate what I'm becoming. I read TRP AVM and stuff by PUAs (like RooshV) and although it's stupid, in my head this seems to be what men \"really think\" although I know it's not. Now, on every date, the irrational part of me wants to f*ck over the man before they can \"pump and dump.\" I've recently stopped dating because this is not fair to these men who've done nothing to me.\n\nThe following is a rant that I, intellectually, know is not true for all the men in the world even though it's true of my family. Unfortunately, emotionally, I seem to believe every word of it somewhat subconsciously. I'm hoping that saying this out loud will help me see how irrational it is.\n\n**beginning of rant**\n\nI don't really know men in my family or among my friends who actually do anything around the house or treat women with respect. Regardless of what ever they say, in the end, they are big-headed, stubborn, controlling, unfaithful, emotionally absent, and dismissive of their wives. They seem to think that, if they're earning money, they're doing their part and that this earns them the right to become the \"king of their castle\" and lord over everyone else. They are emotionally abusive. In fact, this happens even where the woman is the breadwinner. The men I know basically make big decisions (like buying a house, etc.) without their wives' agreement and they never lift a finger to maintain the household. They also seem threatened when the woman becomes the breadwinner. There was a time when I wanted to share my life with a man. I've spent my life crying at how unfair this was and how, as a result, I will actually never find a man who will not make my life a living hell. I no longer cry but I'm filled with rage and have fantasies of hurting the men I date. I also used to cry because suppressing this shit and being a good little Indian girl was killing me. Now, I get so angry when I see this behavior that I can't help but react...I go into rage episodes that are terrifying me.\n\nFor example, my mother was not feeling well yesterday and my dad demanded that she heat up some food for him from the fridge even though her could have easily done it himself. When she said she was too tired/sick he basically screamed at my mother and then asked me to get him something. Although I was perfectly capable of fixing something for him, I told him that I would do nothing for him unless he stopped being a brat and that, if he kept this up, he could look forward to rotting in a nursing home. He went to bed hungry even though he was diabetic to \"punish\" me and my mother. I was secretly happy because, the worse he takes care of himself, the more likely he is to die faster.\n\nEven the people who were not chauvinistic jerks, in my experience, reverted to traditional gender roles and thick-headed machismo after marriage. I am even more terrified of these men because I fear I'd marry one and then uncover his true colors when it's two late. In my head I have  conditions for marriage so that divorce is something I can initiate at the first sign of controlling behavior: complete separation of finances, prenups that detail who gets what well before we ever see an altar, no children so I won't be tied to him, and divorce when I am old or seriously ill (because men leave old/battered models for newer/shiner ones anyway when they turn 50 and men don't have the capability to take care of anything other than their fragile ego). I am disgusted at the prospect of having to depend on a man even slightly for anything from emotional support to material needs. When ever I'm on a date I make a scene if he won't let me pay for myself or for both of us; I am disgusted if I owe him a penny.\n\nI don't understand why women marry at all. Research shows that married men live longer than single ones but that single women outlive married women. Do women marry just because they don't want to be seen as a sluts, lesbians, or cat ladies if they do not do so? Well, that same culture also wants the woman to spend the rest of her life as a doormat to her husband and to suffer abuse. It seems that, when the man is the breadwinner but still has backward attitudes, women are happy. Truth is they pretend to be \"happy\" because they have no choice. They pretend, spend their life living vicariously through their kids, and die. I know this, because the women in my life in this situation (my grandmothers, my great-aunts, my aunts, my cousins) have actually told me this. No man in the family knows this truth and they say how the \"good old days\" were good for everyone. Truly, I believe it's because men don't care about how the women in their lives feel. They are incapable of giving a shit about anyone but themselves. \"Staying with the man\" for the sake of the children makes no sense to me because it's not like they're good fathers.\n\nWhy \"love\" someone who is basically just going to use you? It's obvious he doesn't give two sh*ts about you because he is not wired to do so. I just find it weird that women are seen as the ones who rush to the altar even though they have so much to lose. We must be idiots. For sex, we have one night stands and vibrators because the truth is, in the end, romantic relationships are a sham to turn you into his domestic servant and fucktoy so basically just find someone to relieve the urge when you have it so that you're in control. MRAs will talk about how men rarely get custody in a divorce. Personally, my friends, cousins, and I would have been better off without our fathers. No men in my life have actually been interested or emotionally vested in their children while they were young. Men only seem to need their kids when they are too old to care for themselves. They expect us to love them in their old age after ignoring us all our lives and then have no idea why we hate them. MRAs also talk about alimony and child support. Well, it's not like the men in my family who are divorced pay anything. Deadbeats who're terrified of giving their children a couple of cents.\n\nAre there men who aren't this way? I don't think I've ever met them, but I wish there were but I haven't seen a marriage where the woman is happy. \n\nBy the way, I posted for help on Yahoo! Answers about how to deal with my father many years ago and all the responses I got were like: \"I think it's good your father puts your mother in her place I think all women need to be put in their place.\" That's what brought me here. \n\n**end of rant**\n\n**tl;dr:** I'm starting to hate men because the men in my family (and possibly in my culture) are jerks in general and to women in particular. I don't want to hate men, but I'm starting to become irrational. Are there men who aren't like them in this world?\n","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.confession","subreddit":"confession","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1420078013","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"[Tough Love] My culture and the men I know are making me hate men, marriage, and relationships.

Cant led pops down.\n\nSo I joined this young guardian on his journey, and had a lot of fun guiding him for a mission or three, but finally the urge to run the Raid got the best of me, and I mentioned I had to go, and got my VOG on. I thought that was that and left the young Hunter to his devices in the wild.\n\nEvery now and then in the next few weeks, he'd randomly join my fire team looking for adventure, and i'd see him slowly leveling up. 11, 12, 13. He'd occasionally try to join while raiding, and be booted by whomever I'd be randomly with, and I'd hear his dismay when others mocked him, as he begged to stay, hopelessly outgunned and having no clue what to do.

Start the new year off right I guess..\n\nFor as long as I can remember, my dad was addicted to heroin.. All kinds of different opiates and other drugs, really. My first clear memory of his use was when I was around 6 and he was nodding out at the wheel of the car while driving with me, my brother and mom. We almost all died, my mom kicked him out of the car and next thing I know, \"papa's going on a trip out west to visit a friend\"... I heard this story countless time and obviously it was code for rehab. I grew up with this horrible stereotype against people who used opiates or shot up, saying that would never be me, why would I do the same thing that tore apart my family?\n\nLast August, my dad shot his girlfriend then committed suicide. This happened in the nursing home his girlfriend was in, she had just suffered a stroke and half of her body was paralyzed. It was all over the news and the city shut down a portion of the street the home was on.. I was 2 years into my own opiate habit and hadn't talked to him for 8 months prior. I was devastated and still am.\n\nToday I'm 50 days clean which may not be a lot, but it's the most in almost 3 and a half years. I've been thinking about him a lot and regretting not talking to him. I kept my addiction from him even though he knew better than anyone what I'd be going through. Our relationship was always a roller coaster as most are when there's addiction involved. But I feel like a really fucked up person, a hypocrite, a failed daughter.\n\nI just finished moving and found a box of letters he wrote me over the years while in inpatient, IOP, multiple rehabs over the states, etc. That shit hit me hard because they were almost the same thoughts I've had over and over but reading them while struggling myself was a hard dose of reality.\n\nFuck I'm sorry this is so long I didn't think I had that much to say.

I am here because I need advice regarding someone in my life who has been sucked into the cult (sorry for saying that as someone who has never been apart of JW, I have just seen what they have done to my old friend and I can tell that's what it is...)\n\nAnyways, this lady was my nanny. My parents were busy when I was growing up so this lady took care of me from the day I was born. She was my second Mom. She was not raised JW, but married a man who was; although he had stopped practicing for a while. When I was 12, she had a mental breakdown from psych meds her doctor had prescribed her, and ended up in the psych ward. That's where this lady came and visited her, when she was in her most vulnerable state...This lady got her husband believing again, and then the two of them poisoned her brain. She came out of there a full blown JW, and has been that way for 10 years now (I'm 22 now, as of a couple days ago...)\n\nI cried when I found out she converted. No more birthday celebrations, she wouldn't come over to see me anymore because her husband would not allow it (which she had done weekly for many years; we enjoyed each others company), and every time I would see her she and her husband would hand me pamphlets and readings. I missed her so much that I went to the conventions JW's had in my town just so I could see her. I had to stop after awhile. I could not handle the crap I was hearing from these people at these conventions, and everyone went along with it. Just made me so very depressed...\n\nShe has never been the same since her stay in the pysch ward, and I was wondering if there was any hope for her to come out of this religion. If there is anything I can do to help her. I miss her terribly (I can't even see her in person without her husband being there, and when I do see them he pulls out his laptop that has JW apps on it, including the bible and current readings). \n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated. I just want to know if I can do anything to help her, or if she will be like this for the rest of her life.","media":null,"ups":8,"retrieved_on":1440991356,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/exjw/comments/2qz584/need_some_advice_please/","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Need Some Advice Please","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1420079474","subreddit":"exjw","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.exjw"}

I feel helpless.\n\nMy mom doesn't display overwhelmingly narcissistic characteristics, but does fit some of them, and situations like this morning are a huge indication to me that *something* is wrong and I feel emotionally abused. \n\nI'm in a unique situation right now so I'd appreciate some short-term things I could do to deal. Some background--I'm 20 years old, I attend college and my parents divorced when I was in middle school, so during breaks I do go and live with my mom. I have an older brother, though I don't think either of us are treated as a golden child. I am dependent on her, for a place to stay, as well as for my tuition. Other than that, though, I work and pay for recreational things myself, like food or clothes, etc. We're kind of low-middle class, so I try as much as possible to not strain my mom's resources.\n\nRight now we're in Korea for a few weeks so that we can get plastic surgery. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time and it's finally happening so I'm excited.  However, to get here from the states, my mom did have to take a loan out. But we are enjoying ourselves and my mom has repeatedly said its fine and not to worry. Of course I plan on helping to pay it back.\n\nAnyway, we're living in a small apartment and when I woke up this morning, she was cooking breakfast, I was laying around, we were relaxing. She makes a comment about my upper lip and that I should wax it--which only bothered me because it was yet another put down disguised as a passing comment about my appearance. Even last night she asked if I gained weight or lost it. When I hesitated to respond she said \"probably gained, right?\"\n\nAfter a couple hours of waking up, getting ready, gathering my thoughts, I calmly told her that she hurts my feelings when she only points out my flaws. It makes me feel ugly and worthless when these are the only things that she points out to me about my appearance. She is otherwise a happy and optimistic person, but I have realized she has a hard time giving parental support such as building confidence in me as I was growing up--aren't these things that parents should be doing? Instead she just makes comments that are not very supportive. When I first told her I was vegetarian and she cooked dinner, while she ate the meat she prepared (though she did cook vegetarian dishes as well) she would say \"it's too bad you can't eat food that's delicious as this; I only say this because you don't get to eat good food\" when in reality, because I so choose, it doesn't bother me at all--her pointed remarks bother me more than anything else.\n\nAnyway, this morning--proceed to her blowing up and getting infuriated, bringing up other things that are irrelevant to the current conversation, and reversing the focus of the conversation to the fact that my feelings are only hurt because I'm too sensitive about little things.  I get more and more upset and helpless as she's blowing up at me, when normally i would get frustrated at her response and get equally infuriated.  This time, though, I just felt blank. I tried to remain calm and silent like I know you're supposed to do in negotiation/argument, but once she gets going she does not stop. She says things like, I did all this for you, I buy you all these things to try to make you happy, and yet you are so ungrateful and get upset with these tiny things. When in reality, I thought when we were touristing around a market, we bought little snacks for both of our enjoyment and because it was fun. I proceed to try to return the little spending money she insisted on giving me this morning because of this comment, which only made her even *more* furious and me uncontrollably sobbing at this point. She says have you ever thought that you're hurting my feelings when you do this (as in, she's saying I hurt her feelings when I point out that she's hurting mine)? Why can't you change your attitude and just not be so sensitive? I'm not saying these things to hurt your feelings, can't I even make conversation such as this? If you were upset by my comment you should have told me calmly that I hurt your feelings right when I said it (even though I calmly told her that she hurt my feelings after I collected my thoughts). She also displays faulty memory recall, exaggerating my response to things, and doesn't have much responsibility for her actions. She said the way I reacted to her in the past hurt her feelings, too, and I should tell her directly when my feelings are hurt, except she only brought up the fact that her feelings were hurt after I brought up my concerns--doesn't this sound hypocritical? My mom displays hypocrisy *all* the time, except I thought all parents (and people) were like this and make exceptions of themselves. She vehemently demands me instead to just not get hurt by her comments, and in the future how about we just don't talk to each other, etc.\n\nI know \"I cannot change what you do, I can only change what I do.\" So that's how I approached the issue, by confronting her about what I felt I should have, but even that was inadequate for her and I shouldn't have gotten upset in the first place. She asks me if she's not even allowed to say these **little** things that didn't even have the intention of being hurtful (nevermind the fact that they *were* hurtful, only the fact that she didn't *mean* for them to be), but then shouldn't I also be able to bring up these things and be able to talk to my own mom about anything? Am I overreacting?\n\nI just wanted to point out it makes me feel anxious and ugly when she makes only offhanded comments about my appearance, and perhaps she could try not to do that, and then it turned into her blowing up about why all *my* actions are wrong, how much she sacrificed for me, etc.\n\nDuring previous arguments, she refuses to talk to me calmly, or even at all. Usually, she just says \"I am not discussing this with you right now\" even though I know with no communication nothing will ever get resolved. It's extremely frustrating. This happens often, and usually she responds to arguments with lofty and impossible solutions--\"fine, from here on out, you pay for everything yourself (this was common in my middle/high school years), from here on out lets just not talk, you do your thing and I'll do mine,\" etc.\n\nI want to go into more detail, but then I would just go on forever. I will say, though, that starting at (my) puberty we did fight a lot. I harbor a lot of guilt for this because, admittedly, I felt like it was my fault if I was being mean to her and for some reason we just didn't get along, and after a lot of consideration I resolved to become independent, and of course one of my long term goals is to be able to support her. She did, after all, raise me as a single mom working as a low-skill laborer.  And I feel that my personality trait was more geared to be introverted from the start (quiet, shy, easily emotional), but my childhood refined these personality traits to be a bit depressed (though never clinically diagnosed) and feel like I have little worth. I used to self-harm for several years in high school, and had suicidal thoughts. I have never gotten help or counseling of any sort.\n\nNowadays, I have just felt that any arguments we have are because we grew up in two different cultures and we perceive things differently, and exacerbated by a language barrier (my mom is a korean immigrant, but still is quite decent at english). Is it possible that this is the case?\n\nI do depend on her for a lot. She pays my tuition, she's making this trip happen for me....but more and more I feel extremely torn between wanting to gradually become completely independent (and in my 'fantasies,' no contact), and yet feeling like I owe her so much and how could I ever go no contact with my own mother? Am I truly being ungrateful and unreasonable? Where do I go from here? Tomorrow is my surgery so I'll still have to depend on her for this. We are here for several weeks, before I leave and go back to school. Then what? Someone please help me see this from an outsider's point of view. Someone please help me know how to respond. I know this is long but I wanted to lay out my situation as best as I could.

(Very) Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm a little nervous posting, since I'm usually never vocal on social sites. But this subreddit seems so friendly and I'd like to talk with other pregos about the ups and downs of pregnancy, while I'm still pregnant.\n\nTo introduce myself, I'm 21 and pregnant with my first baby - a boy! - due January 29th. I'll hit 36 weeks once midnight rolls around, which is exciting! I've been with my fiance for over 5 years, but we didn't expect to start a family so soon. Despite the unexpected baby, we're really excited to welcome this little booger to the world.\n\nI've been very fortunate to have experienced an easy pregnancy. I only had one full day of morning sickness. (I woke up with a headache, wanted to throw up all day at work, got home, threw up foam, and slept with a headache.) Then no morning sickness/throwing up ever after that. It worries me a little, since I'm the type to follow myths and superstitions so I'm over here thinking: Easy pregnancy = long/hard labor or not so healthy baby. But I'm sure things will be fine...\n\nThe only two things throughout this pregnancy really affecting me are my weight and my skin. I gained 50 lbs this pregnancy! I'm at the heaviest I've ever been in my life, which doesn't feel good. I was around 115 lbs in the beginning, which was already a lot, for me, considering I'm only 4'11\". Now I'm almost 170 lbs, which is freaking me out because I'm short and the weight makes me feel super heavy. I'm walking whenever I can before I have my baby, but I don't see myself losing much by then. I'm hoping that, once I have my baby, my hormones will change enough that I can lose a little bit naturally. Hopefully with more walking after delivering + breastfeeding + watching what I eat will help bring me back to my pre-pregnancy weight. \n\nThe skin issue I have... is ridiculous. I had pretty bad acne in high school, but it was just on my face. After graduating, the acne went away naturally. I was getting used to having good skin, then I got pregnant. It wasn't bad at first, but now that I'm almost at my due date, my acne has multiplied and spread all over my body. I'm getting acne in places I've never had before, or thought possible. Since my acne went away naturally (presumably after puberty/hormones finished messing with my body), should I just wait it out after my baby is born?\n\nI'm feeling conflicted about my weight, though, because a lot of people have been pretty nice about it. I had a baby shower a few days ago, and one of my sister-in-law's friends commented that I didn't look that big at all. Then one of my childhood friends commented the same thing, as well as informing me that someone we knew from grade school was pregnant and had looked like she was carrying twins when she was only pregnant with one baby. \n\nBut at the same time.. I feel pretty plump. That, along with the acne partying up on my skin, is making me feel gross and insecure. Just wanted to vent about my feels about the weight gain and acne, but I'd really appreciate any/all feedback with your own experiences, like how you dealt with those two things during pregnancy, even words of encouragement, or that maybe I'm over-thinking all of this.\n\nTL;DR New here, FTM. Insecure about all the weight gain and crazy amount of acne all over. Should I worry now, or wait until after delivering to see if things disappear naturally (but slowly)?","id":"2qz83j","archived":true,"name":"t3_2qz83j","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":6,"is_self":true,"author":"juvily","from":null,"stickied":false,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/2qz83j/greetings_feelin_fat_and_pimply_long_post/","from_kind":null,"created":1420081734,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s7cl","from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"score":8,"edited":false}

I'm also very lucky that I have not run into any problems with leaking so I have an ample supply of unused wafers/bags/gear in stock - I haven't even used half of my previous 3 month supply order.

This was a fairy tale love, something that could never be duplicated. He could make my heart skip a beat by just looking at me and winking, which he always did in a crowded room or when we were with other couples and knew I didn't feel like I fit in with the other ladies. We liked making it on our own, hunting and fishing for food, maintaining a huge vegetable garden I canned and cooked from, backyard chickens. Now, we did go to the grocery store, and cooked steak and shrimp and other items. I'm not sure why I'm on this in such detail... He was my hard working man, and I was a working Suzy homemaker. We both graduated from a great college with Ag degrees. God, I love him...\n\nI moved for work. I tried for two years while working as a self contractor on a project to find something in our state. It didn't happen. Six months after the project ended, I only had enough funds for two more months. I took a job out of state... We were engaged. I daydreamed about our future.\n\nI fucked up. I cheated. We split... I still loved him. Four years later I still love him. He says he loves me , too.. He says he blames himself for certain things, but I won't even mention those because I placed the final straw on the camel's back. \n\nI don't blame him. But, here's the thing. This love is so great that after four years, two of which we did not talk, I never stopped loving him, or daydreaming about him, or dreaming about him. I will never be able to replace him, and I don't want to. I will never be able to duplicate that love, and I don't want to. I am 30. I will never have kids. I will never marry. I am very successful at work, but I don't care to continue. I have promoted quickly, and on the brink of $100,000/yr when bonuses and extras are added in. I am not an idiot. I do not want to live another 30 years, slowly aging alone. I just honestly don't want to. I sometimes cry if a certain song comes on, or I find another picture, or my mom asks about him..again..  but when I remind myself it will be over, I'm so relieved I can't explain it! It's like a vise is gripping my chest all day everyday, then I think of my solution and it's ok. I can smile and laugh at work, and perform my job well. But, it's no longer something that will keep me getting out of bed forever.\n\nI know I will shoot myself. In a shower with the curtain drawn because it will be easier to clean. I know I will drink a little first, to make sure the blood loss will get me if the bullet doesn't. I know it will kill him.. So I'm cutting ties so he won't think he could have helped.\n\n**edit* I guess I should explain that we met up yesterday. We held hands, he played with my hair, we kissed, and he said he loved me. But too much heartache on both sides means it will never work. \n\n**tl;dr**\nI'm a moron who fucked up.

I learned HTML and started doing (terrible) graphic design when I was 13 and then learned CSS, stuck with those two things getting me by on the web for a long ass time. Back then, I used to do stuff for my friends, lots of fansites for bands I liked, MySpace, etc etc. As time has gone on, I've had mostly graphic design jobs (thats what I went to college for) and while I love graphic design, (mostly) front-end development is where my heart is. Coding gives me a sense of pride like nothing else.  \n\nBut here's my problem: I have no kind of coding portfolio. When I was attending college, I kind of backed-off from coding.. this was around 2009 and I feel like I missed the damn train! I came back and everyone was using GitHub and frameworks this and blah blah that.. I felt really lost, but over the last 2 years (after becoming a mom, yay babies!) I've slowly got myself back up to speed as to what is going on. I literally read about design and development every single day, for a lot of time a day. I'm obsessed... but I feel like that's ALL I do is READ.  \n\nI currently hold a full-time in-house position as a graphic designer/front-end developer, but the company I work for's website is a nightmare and my bosses have no intention of changing it (believe me, I've been in multiple tearful pissed-off arguments with my boss about coding practices! For example: We still use / in our img and br tags.. yes, br tags. We add style=\"margin-top: WHATEVERPIXELVALUEFITSpx\" to all of our divs. Jesus christ please help me). The last job I was at, I did lots of coding, but most of it isn't released yet or I worked on 20% of the project, so I don't want to claim it as something I worked on, considering they blast their URL all over the web pages they make too.  \n\nI want to be a front-end developer who holds a position where my input matters. I am so passionate about coding. I love responsive design, I've learned JavaScript quite well over the last few months. I'm all about optimization and clean code. I've fallen in love with CSS pre-processors....The tiny pieces of code I do make at work that I am very proud of, should I post them on GitHub even if they don't seem that important to the outside world?  \n\nI've made similar posts/comments like this other times on Reddit and people usually say things like \"Network, go to meetups!\" Which would be great, except that I literally have no friends besides my boyfriend and my one co-worker who I am really close to and he feels the same way about the job as I do (but he's a designer) and we have tried to start our own thing.. which is slowly coming along, but still  no websites, just design. This is because I moved from Chicago to the middle of Illinois and I know no one out here. I work 40+ hours a week, have an hour commute each day and as I said before, I am a mom of a 2 year old.. so I don't have much time to go out and leisurely meet people.  \n\nI guess I'll stop whining now, basically if anyone has any suggestions on how to meet people (I've posted on reddit trying to meet other devs but everyone faded out) or how I can prove my skillset to start working on an open-source project. My last resort is basically to start building fake websites for things I pull out of a hat or something, because I really need to change my current situation. I appreciate any and all advice.","retrieved_on":1440991282,"ups":25}

I think I did everything right up until the wiring part. It seemed like me and him had different wires. \n\nI had the big blue usb 3.0 connected correctly, and then he talks about plugging in a smaller usb 2.0 cable right beside the big blue one. I searched for this cable and I cannot find it ( I know I didn't lose it, everything was organized). I also found out that I have the modular version of the psu, while he has the builder version. What is the difference between the 2? I was wondering if you guys could look at my build and tell me how to wire my pc? I looked at my Mother board manual and it didn't explain much on which cables go where, it just told me some kind of voltage stuff or something ( I didn't understand it ). Although I looked at a MSI video tutorial on how to installl the LED wires, which I did and I think I did it right. I also plugged the SATA cables, and the HD Audio cable. \n\nThat was all I did and so what I wanted to try was to turn on the PC to see what shows up, and the computer didn't even turn on. Does that mean I also messed something up during the motherboard/cpu/ram/psu/graphics card installations?

This year has been a transformative one. Thinking back to january of this year feels so far away. At that time is was a community college and working at Wich Wich. I am a different person now then I was then. Recently I've realized that my parents never truly payed attention to me in a meaningful way. And while this is not necessarily their fault as there is no \"handbook for parenthood\" it lead to a lot of feelings of inferiority. That when I was a kid and my parents didn't pay attention to me or ask questions I told myself that I wasn't good enough and didn't deserve their attention. I was wrong. And ive only just realized that a few months ago. Lately i've been trying to grapple with this new found sense that I can be as good or better than anyone else at whatever I choose to do. That just because I do something does not detract from its value. I can be a genius. And in a way that's what i'm trying to be. I want to explore my mind and map out and delve into the feelings that I have and share those feelings through art. I feel like I can be great and that is taking some getting used to.\n\n\nThis year was pretty eventful for me. I quit school to start working at (A pottery manufacturing warehouse) and I haven't looked back yet. One day i'd like to continue studying but today is not that day.\n\n\nAlso this year was my first ceramics sale which was very successful and helped to convince me that I can make art that people want.\n\n\nI've been single all year. Which has been trying at times. I've yet to figure out if I've been single because i've been focused on other things, or I'm still too afraid to let someone that close to me again, or that I just haven't found some yet. I want to think it's the last one but its probably a mix of all three. Hopefully this year i'll talk to a girl... maybe ill even like her.\n\n\nI wonder when I will be self sufficient. I live with my mom and I still rely on both of my parents for my survival. I hope to be able to support myself soon as I truly want my own space to be in. We'll see.\n\n\nMy parents got divorced this year. I'm 19 so I feel it hasn't affected me as much as my 8 year old brother but it has still been hard. Mostly it was hard when they were officially separated but both still living in the house. Those were trying times. Now the divorce is final and their lives are separate which has made it easier to deal with. I do still live with the fact that my parents don't love each other which makes me sad when I see parents that do.\n\n\nGetting sponsored for surfing has been exciting. Not much has happened with it yet but I hope that it goes well and that I don't have to change who I am in order to remain sponsored. We'll see in the coming months how that goes.\n\n\nI also took acid for the first time this year, which was both eye opening and another turning point for me. The trip was very fun and having my friend there watching me draw and truly appreciating what I was drawing which was a very good feeling and I am grateful to him for. Before I took it Acid was such a mystery. It appeared to give artists this ability to create amazing things and I wanted that for myself. To an extent it does enable artistic expression but I realized that great art does not come from the acid, it comes from the person and that I can be a person who does great art too, with our without acid. \n\n\nLiving in a van has also been on my mind lately. It seems like something i'd like to try and I hope to buy a van this coming year.\n\n\nI've been working with David (a wonderful potter) for about 6 months now and that is another thing that has been very good for me and that i am grateful for. David is a truly passionate person. Not in a wild PASSION sort of way but more of a quiet passion. He works everyday on what he loves and creates what he wants to create. He loves his family, supports himself, has hobbies and stays healthy. He has been very supportive of me in a way that i have never experienced before and it has been extremely encouraging and I am so grateful for that. I truly admire him.\n\n\nI feel my sense of self after what feels like both forever and the blink of an eye. Im excited to continue shaping my self and exploring my mind. Right now I feel like im forging through new territory and Im both scared and incredibly excited to see what lies ahead. So long to this year, I welcome the new one with open arms.\n\n\nNotable movies: Her; Synechdoche New York; Nightcrawler; Zodiac; Jodorowskys Dune\n\nNotable Music: Check the mixtapes (If theres interest Ill post a playlist or two of mine :) )\n\n\nSo this ended up being very very long haha.\n\nI originally wrote this for myself but hopefully you enjoyed some of my thoughts. I'd really like to hear how your year has been too and would love to hear your struggles and triumphs. Anyways, Happy new year guys!\n\n","retrieved_on":1440991268,"ups":3,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"infp","created_utc":"1420085012","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.infp","hide_score":false,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"default","title":"My New Year Reflections","secure_media_embed":{},"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/2qzc2g/my_new_year_reflections/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qn2o","from_kind":null,"created":1420085012,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"score":3,"edited":false,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"num_comments":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"id":"2qzc2g","link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2qzc2g","gilded":0,"author":"[deleted]","from":null,"is_self":true}
