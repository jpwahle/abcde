Almost. I've been trying my best to stare down the orderlies for the entire bumpy, uncomfortable ride out here, but neither of them seem to care. They can bear my stares as easily as they pinned me down and forced me into this straightjacket and gag.\n\n\"It's for your own good,\" my stepfather's lawyer insisted. \"We can't have you spitting and screaming and making a scene in front of the neighbors now, can we?\" To be fair, I might have had a chance at having the gag removed had I not taken full advantage of the vocabulary I'd learned from the sailors on my trip to Marrakesh last summer... but the opportunity to watch his oversized mustache tremble in outrage was too good to resist. \n\nThe orderlies push me out of the cramped cab and into the fresh, grey day outside. I take a deep breath, trying to take a few steps to stretch my legs, but they hold me still. To my immense disappointment I see a third orderly bringing out a wheelchair. I try to resist, but my struggles are like a rabbit twisting in a wolf's jaws. They strap my straightjacket to the back of the chair and cuff my ankles to the foot rests. I grunt unhappily through the gag as I'm wheeled unceremoniously into the stately manor.\n\nIt seems my stepfather is sparing no expense in this farce. I'm certain the moment I get to speak to an actual doctor, I'll be able to promptly prove my sanity and be released. After all I'm 18 now, legally an adult, and entitled to half of my father's estate as per his last will and testament, no longer beholden to the whims of my mother or her new husband, the miserable bastard who dares to call himself my stepfather.\n\nI'm sure it's no coincidence that he chose to invite his equally wicked friends over for my birthday dinner last night, then proceed to let me have as much wine as I want to survive their lecherous and inane questions. I was already past the point of tipsy before he announced his real present for me: a fiance! One of his friends' sons, no doubt, overseas for another six months before his contract was up... a joke of a match, for sure. I didn't even bother to look at the photograph before rejecting it.\n\nI only vaguely remember the shouting match that followed, but I remember being called hysterical more times than I can count. Honestly, who wouldn't be furious to discover that a contract for a bloody marriage had been drawn up while they were still underage? I was sure I would be able to fight it in court. Hence this desperate attempt to stall. Well, it wouldn't work! I cast an impetuous glance at the lawyer as we entered the director's office.\n\nTo my surprise, no one made any attempt to remove my gag, much the less straightjacket. Instead the director simply rose to shake the lawyer's hand, a saccharine smile on his face. \"A pleasure to meet you. I assume you're the legal counsel for Mr. Richard Evans?\" He inquired.\n\n\"Indeed I am. I represent Mr. Evans interests regarding his stepdaughter, Josephine Delacroix,\" he confirmed.\n\n\"Excellent. I'm Director Myers. With me today is the honorable Constable Bailey, as legal witness,\" he introduced the third man, who tipped his hat politely but didn't speak. \"Now, I understand you're a busy man, so I won't waste any of your time here today. You're familiar with the nature of the treatment offered here at Blackbriar St. Dymphna's?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" the lawyer replies with a lecherous grin. \"My wife spent three months here just after our honeymoon. She returned a much happier woman.\"\n\nThe director's smile takes on a wicked turn. \"Excellent. In that case I'll just need you to sign here and here,\" he says, extending a length contract which the lawyer signs without question. \"And ms. Delacroix will have to sign here... unless she consents to have you sign in her stead?\"\n\nI shake my head emphatically. \"That looks like consent to me. Wouldn't you agree, Constable?\" The constable nods. The lawyer signs a third time. I'm too busy trying to scream through the gag and thrashing side by side to hear any of the rest of their conversation, but it doesn't last long. They shake hands, the lawyer leaves, and without so much as a word to me the director summons the orderlies to wheel me away.\n\nTen minutes later I'm strapped down to what they call an exam table, although I've never seen any doctor's office with equipment like this before. I can't budge an inch, and what's worse, my naked, nubile body is on full display, legs forced wide open so that the only defense for my sex is a tuft of dark hair, for any passing nurse or orderly to ogle! My face is burning with humiliation from that, and also from the drool that I can't keep from spilling out. My jaw is pried open as wide as can be with a ratcheting gag that looks suspiciously like something used for serious dental work.\n\nI keep thinking that if I could just pinch myself I might wake up from this nightmare, but I don't even have enough freedom of motion to do that.\n***\nKinks: bondage (lots of it, and especially in exposing and/or uncomfortable positions), humiliation, medical play, enemas, gags, forced orgasms, clit &amp; nipple torture, patronizing attitudes, semi-historical settings (flexible on the time period and our accuracy to it).\n\nLimits: scat, pee, mind control, incest, underage characters\n\nMy ideal partner would play as one or more doctors who, during daylight hours, attempt to cure her \"hysteria\" by negatively reinforcing vaginal stimulation (i.e. teaching her to associate pain with vaginal sex and vice versa) and positively reinforcing blowjob and anal training (forced orgasms while having her throat and/or ass stretched). Major bonus points if her hymen is kept intact by having only very small insertions, or none at all. Meanwhile, every night, one or more nurses/orderlies decides to test out her newfound skills. Fairly intense clit and/or breast torture during either or both phases is also preferred.\n\nHowever, if you have ideas that differ from my ideal, shoot me a PM anyway. I'm open to altering details since my ideal is pretty specialized!

It seems like the people you need to be killing have so much armor that this is negligable (Other carries). And that this only helps killing characters that shouldn't be the issue or your focus in the fight. \n\n\n2) Armlet- Am I keeping this when I'm 6 slotted? Is honestly my only question regarding this item\n\n\n3) Echo Sabre- Obviously this isn't an item you keep when you hit super late game, but does it even offer enough power to pick up after blink dagger? It seems like a good item, but at the same time seems to be bad since it gives low stats for a second hit, but unless you have a daedalus or something it seems like other items would strong replace this. I want this item to be amazing because it seems so cool, but it doesn't feel like it is. \n\n\n4) From a 1 pos, what Items do I wanna go for? And what does my end all be all 6 slot look like for dmg if a game goes super ridiculously late game. Note on this, my general build is | Wand, Treads, Armlet, Blink | then I start to flounder because I don't know what items to get for more 'carry' power.

Throughout the course of this (otherwise relatively easy) pregnancy, I have had a couple of weeks where my anxiety is through the roof, almost to the point of panic.

I've been trying to cure my phimosis for a long time now. I'm 19 yrs old and I first started stretching near the end of 2017 for about a month. Truth be told, I wasn't stretching properly, because I wasn't stretching the phimotic band which in my case is super deep down. I have so much foreskin and it's very thick so it makes it really hard to try and shove two qtips down the phimotic band to help me stretch it (because I can't use my thumb or fingers). The opening is super tiny (but to my surprise, it got a little bit bigger somehow, idk if this is from me pulling my foreskin down randomly). I went to the family doctor and he gave me this useless hydrocortisone acetate cream (it's not strong at all) and told me to come back in 6-8 weeks to try and stretch my foreskin. He actually ended up pulling my foreskin all the way back and I saw my fully exposed head flaccid for the first time, but he did it with force (but it wasn't painful). I have never been able to do that myself because I always get scared it will get stuck. Knowing that pulling it back is not a good way to stretch my foreskin and I can't my fingers into the phimotic band (which is super deep), what do I do? I'm going to keep experimenting with the qtips if I can but as of rn, if I can't do anything, I'm just gonna book an appointment and get a referral to the urologist and see what he says about getting a circumcision because this is way too much stress for me...like I can't even do a simple stretch because of how deep and tiny the hole is....what can I do????? :( ","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Phimosis","subreddit_id":"t5_2weqn","subreddit_subscribers":649,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Deep phimotic band please help me :(","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Phimosis/comments/8114bt/deep_phimotic_band_please_help_me/","whitelist_status":null}

I know she loves me, but she never shows it. Anything I say or do is wrong and I\u2019m wrong for upsetting her. She has a horrendous relationship with a boyfriend who I have tried multiple times to remove from our lives. I even put myself in the hospital to show her how serious I was. Do you know what she said to me on the way there? \u201cWhy would you do this to me? Do you know how much this is going to cost?\u201d Instead of worrying about if I am okay ... it\u2019s ultimately about her. She makes it known that I am the reason why she considers suicide every day or just leaving and never coming home again. I just lost my father in January of 2016. She\u2019s the only parent I have left. I am 17, graduating a year early, and got into the school with the lowest acceptance rate in Colorado. Her response is that 1) I\u2019ve robbed her of another year by graduating early . 2) She doesn\u2019t know if I can go to my dream school because it\u2019s going to cost her too much . She\u2019s constantly trying to control every aspect of my life yet at the same time shaming me for trying to be independent. A simple question such as \u201cWhen are we going to the grocery store?\u201d Or \u201cCan I go spend a night at a friend\u2018s house?\u201d Is enough to prompt extreme anger followed by cussing me out for \u201cbadgering\u201d her though I\u2019ve only asked once. She recognizes none of my accomplishments and instead complains about the burden they\u2019ve caused on her. She puts herself in financial debt to give me whatever I do (or don\u2019t) ask for and then blames me for not having any money. I try everything in my power to please her but to no avail. Something is always below her expectations. In her eyes, I am selfish, ungrateful, and have no regard for anyone other than myself. She is jealous of relationships I have formed with other women, such as my god mother and boyfriend\u2019s mothers. Says that I \u201cgive them everything she deserves. She bends over backwards for me and they get all the respect and love and she gets nothing.\u201d I feel that whenever anything good happens for me, she is jealous and guilt trips me about going on trips, to college, buying myself food/groceries, going out with friends, etc. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore and I need help. \n\nEDIT: This is my first post ever, so excuse whatever formatting/grammatical errors I may have made. I just thought of some things I forgot to include: My mother only talks positively about me to other people. She tells them how proud she is, how much she loves me, but never tells me anything but how inadequate I am of being her daughter. My reason for posting this is for advice on how to deal with her. We\u2019ve been to counseling but after a few visits we quit going even though I think we need to keep going. All I want is a regular relationship with my mom where we do things and hang out and talk about stuff. I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s possible anymore. My mother is miserable (mostly because of her shit boyfriend &amp; shit finances) and never lets me forget how much I add to that. Does anyone have any advice? I really want to repair this relationship.. as I said, she\u2019s the only parent I have left.

His dad died when he was two, so it is just the two of them (all of my other brothers are older than me). \nMy mom is on disability and they have relied on her disability and my little brother's father's death benefit for most of his life (with financial help from me and my husband). The thing is, my mom is one of the most irresponsible people I know when it comes to finances. She can never make the money last the entire month, despite the fact that she has more than enough to cover expenses. She likes to spoil her grandchildren at Christmas by buying each of the four kids at least 5 expensive presents each (she does this for the attention. My brothers absolutely hate this and have told her as much, since they don't want to spoil their kids, but she guilts them with her illness). She likes to order out, because she hates cooking and always has since before her illness set in. So she orders grinders and pizza several times a month, along with buying Smartfood popcorn almost every day. She has a shopping addiction on Amazon and buys useless stuff she doesn't need on a regular basis. Therefore, this leaves my brother with nothing. When he turns 18, the death benefit will run out, leaving my mom with just her disability, which is only 800 a month. She has no money saved. She knows this day is coming in 2020 but will not prepare. \n\n\nI had my brother over my house for the weekend, and found out that my mom is already guilting him into staying home with her over going to college, so he can work and take care of her. Both of my two oldest brothers have already offered to take her in when it comes time for this, but she doesn't want to live with them, so she is already discouraging my brother from preparing for art school, getting his driving license, etc. She is trying to hold him back. I know this, because she did the same thing to me. But I found out this past weekend that she is ordering out so much that my brother has nothing to eat for the last week to two weeks of the month. So my husband and I want to open up a bank account for him and keep it a secret from my mom. She can't know about it because she absolutely has zero problem taking his money from him for ordering out or whatever. I want him to have backup money so he can buy his own groceries and cook himself healthy meals. I also want to help him prepare for driving school costs and all of that. \n\n\n\nHe will be getting a job soon, but the thing is, my mom will take all of that money too by guilting him incessantly. She did the same to my high school income. I had to pay the gas/electric/oil/grocery bills because we always came up short. She used that money to buy herself cigarettes instead. My mom held my little brother's well being over my head, which is why I have always caved and given her money. I've already told him to plan to go to college as if mom doesn't exist, because his only job is to look out for himself. Between me and my two oldest brothers, we can handle taking care of her. But she is making him feel as if all of the responsibility of taking care of her will fall on his shoulders alone (she is a master manipulator). \n\n\nSo how do I do this? Is there a way I can open up an account in my name and add him as somebody who can access it? He isn't my son, so I don't know how this works since he is a minor. He already has a great head on his shoulders. For example, whenever my mom orders out, he doesn't order anything. He eats beans and rice instead. I want to start teaching him how to budget and save his income in a responsible way. But my mom can't possibly know about any of the money. At all. But I don't live in the same town as him, so he needs to have a way to access the money without me. Any ideas? \n\n\nThanks a lot, guys!\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I have a 16 year old brother who needs my help. Our mother is bad with money, leaving my brother with no money for groceries or other needs. How do I help him out financially without my mother knowing about any of it? Especially since I am not his parent. Thank you!

You might have seen me around before as I've posted in the past without much luck, but I believe they say something about not succeeding and trying again.  I swear I'm not a bot, I'm just determined; I may not have gotten much of a response due to either lack of interest at the time of the post, my post being buried at the time, the fact that guys are a dime a dozen here, or the ungodly length of it, but I keep at it in the hopes that I can find the one that this truly speaks to.\n\nSome have asked why I come to Reddit to seek this, and really, why are any of us here?  We're searching for something that we can't find elsewhere so we've decided to give this a shot.  I've tried Fetlife and CollarSpace without much luck, dating is difficult in my area (everyone is super country, as in enjoying \"huntin', fishin' and muddin' while listenin' to country music\".  That's cool if they like that, but it doesn't mesh well with who I am), and I seem to work most of the time these days.  So, this is the next step for me.\n\nAs mentioned in the title, distance is not an issue for me.  I'm hoping to meet someone and chat to see where things lead, if there's a connection of any sort.  If there is, we can move from there.  Distance is a relatively small issue if you can find someone who is truly perfect for you, after all.\n\nI should also mention that age isn't an issue.  To some extent it will be of course, but I don't mind an age gap in either direction at all.  If it's an issue for you, that's understandable.  If you think it will be an issue for me, well the only way to really find out is to message me, now isn't it?\n\nIdeally my partner would be what is typically called an adult babygirl, and I'd like to elaborate on that term since some might not be familiar with it.  Essentially it's someone who enjoys the nurturing, loving and structured aspect of a Daddy Dom or DD/lg relationship but isn't a little themselves, meaning that they don't have a mental age that they regress to, among other things.  (I don't identify as a Daddy myself, however due to my protective and supportive/nurturing nature you could say I'm Daddy leaning.)   I have nothing against littles, but overall this is my ideal relationship.  If that doesn't necessarily clear things up, you're more than welcome to message me with any questions you might have.\n\nHowever, I'm certainly open to anyone who sees this and is interested (including those of any experience level) as I don't want to limit myself when I could possibly find chemistry with someone, so I'm open to regular submissives and slaves as well.\n\nAs for the ward, I seek someone that I can guide and protect, as well as someone I can be head over heels in love with (partner in crime).\n\n**Prepare for a wall of text!**  It's a bit long, but I assure you it's worth the read if the title of my post appealed to you in the first place.  I decided that since I'm putting myself out there with a post, I want to truly and fully put myself out there and represent myself.  Yes, this has been copied and pasted from previous posts, however I'm hoping that those reading this will recognize the effort that was put into this and get a good feel for who I am as a person.  **If you feel it's too much, save it for later, skim or even just message me if you would rather get to know me more naturally.**\n\nMy post is cobbled together from thoughts, beliefs and realizations that I have come upon in my years in the lifestyle (which is why you might see slightly different styles of writing in different parts, this post is taken from my kink profiles and are the sum result of over ten years of experience that I find I still add to every now and then. I try to edit and organize it a bit from time to time, but it's difficult due to the fact that there's so much that I wish to include.)\n\nLong story short, I can be a bit...rambly, sometimes.  So apologies in advance for that, although I have recently made great strides in editing my post.  So I've got that going for me, which is nice.\n \nWhile it's certainly a lengthy read, it's not nearly as bad as it seems.  I recommend reading the whole thing (obviously since I wrote it), especially if you're interested in getting to know a kinky, geeky and empathetic person. \n\nNow that I've covered that, it's time to get to the part you've been waiting for.\n\n### About me\n\nI decided to put this part first because I believe that, above all else, the people involved should connect on a personal level and \"click\", if you will.  This tells about who I am and my hobbies and such.  If someone cannot accept this part of me, how could we possibly get along?\n\nI'm a lighthearted, playful and fairly laid back, yet somewhat serious minded, person who's rather upbeat and probably too curious for his own good.  I'm also kind, caring, friendly, sometimes cynical and often sarcastic (although in a lighthearted manner, and never at the expense of others.)  There's nothing I love to do more than laugh; I love most things involving humor, although I do believe there's a very fine line between hilarity and stupidity.\n\nNow, for some little bits of trivia about me.\n\n* According to the Myers-Briggs system, I'm an INFP.  I don't follow it religiously, but I believe there are some elements of truth to it.\n* I'm a hopeless romantic, an old soul who's young at heart, a cynical optimist and a realistic dreamer.\n* I'm definitely that type that believes in better safe than sorry, and one of my mottos is \"Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.\"  I also tend to do copious amounts of research before any big decision.  If you wish to stall me for a long period of time, one of the best ways is to try to get me to make a major decision between two very similar choices.\n* I consider myself to be a very grounded, down to earth and genuine person.\n* I'm an emotionally intelligent person who's well aware of his inner workings due to my introspective nature.\n* I'm extremely empathetic and am able to easily see things from multiple perspectives and points of view, something I take pride in.\n* I feel deeply, which can lead to me taking things to heart and sometimes reading too much into things or overanalyzing them.  Thankfully, due to the two points listed above, I'm able to take a step back from my emotions and generally understand the intent and meaning behind words and actions so there's less of a chance of misunderstanding.\n* I'm extremely friendly and believe in treating others with the same respect that you would like to receive and generally try to do what I feel is \"right\" by others (more on that in a bit.)\n* I like to believe in the best of human nature, although I seem to be let down a fair bit.  Even so, I don't want to let that stop me.\n* I have very strong values and ideals, and an even stronger moral compass.\n* I believe people are free to do and believe what they want, so long as they don't harm themselves or others, or attempt to force those beliefs on others.\n* I believe that a life lived for others is the only life worth living.\n* I believe that there's no point in worrying about things that you can't change. If you let yourself get dragged down by it and obsess over it, you'll find yourself crushed under the weight of all the injustices in the world.\n* I've been told (rather often actually) that I have a very nice voice, frequently being told that I should go into radio or be an announcer of some kind.  I'm very expressive and my voice reflects that, having lots of highs and lows.  Truthfully, I believe it's one of my better features.\n* I much prefer talking to typing in general, especially when first getting to know someone as you get a much better idea of their personality.  Also, I feel like I come across kind of...stiff in my writing style when that's very much not the case, so voice allows me to showcase my truest self.\n* I'm a bit of a homebody (mainly because I live in a small town where there's nothing to do, so video games have become a sort of a refuge for me, but more on that in a bit as well), although I do enjoy going out and doing things.\n* I've got a nice guy next door look in that I have no tattoos or piercings, have glasses, stay clean shaven and have a bit of a baby face (as in I look rather young, I often get mistaken for being in my early 20's).  I wouldn't say that with my look I would be called, handsome, sexy or hot, however I have been called cute (I've also been called handsome, it still doesn't feel right to me though.)  I'm also rather pale due to the fact that I stay indoors most of the time (if you can't tell from that, I'm white.)\n* Because of the above fact, and given my very friendly nature, people tend to view me as rather innocent, which I suppose isn't totally wrong.  I'll admit that I can be a bit naive at times in regards to people and the world.\n* I tend to be a confidant of sorts; due to my open and genuine nature and what I've been told is a welcoming...aura, I suppose, people tend to trust me, coming to me to confide things and seek out advice.  This is something that brings me great happiness and pride as having the trust of others is important to me. \n*  Promises are very important to me; once I give my word in regards to something I'll keep it, even if I don't particularly want to.  As cheesy as it might sound, to me my word is my bond.\n* Admittedly, subtlety is not one of my strong points.  I'm a very open, upfront and honest person.  I'm terrible at lying (I hate doing it and I just give away that I am) and can't keep a straight face to save my life.  If I were an actor, I would probably be Jimmy Fallon.\n* I welcome people to give me constructive criticism and feedback as I'm constantly looking to improve myself.\n* I can't fake a smile to save my life, it has to be natural for me.  One of the many reasons I hate having photos taken of me.\n* I find intelligence, humor and kindness to be the most desirable traits in a partner (although being easy on the eyes doesn't hurt.)\n* My senses are all very sensitive, and can sometimes overwhelm me when I'm introduced to new stimuli.\n*  I used to do drugs.  I still do, but I used to too.  No, not really, just wanted to throw a little Mitch Hedberg in here.  I don't drink, smoke or do drugs.  While I have no issue with those who drink, I do tend to avoid smokers and hardcore drug users.\n* Despite what the length of my post may say about me, I absolutely hate writing.\n* I love to visit places but I hate the actual traveling (which is why if I could have one power it would be teleportation [actually if I could have one power it would be the ability to manipulate space and time, however for simplicity's sake I'm just going to say teleportation for now {not Star Trek teleportation though, fuck that.}])\n* I hate waiting and I hate making others wait.\n* I love the symbolism of trees and what they represent: strength, vitality, protection, life.\n* I have two cats, Ivy and Jasmine (there are stories behind both names), and probably talk to them like people a bit too much.\n* I absolutely love animals, I could easily spend hours in a pet store just wandering around and looking.  Seriously, if you want to make me hate a bad guy, have him hurt an animal.  Ironically, I'm practically a carnivore.  I'm convinced that I would starve if I had to hunt for my own food just because I couldn't bring myself to hurt them.\n* I'm a bit of a foodie, I'm all about sauces, spices/seasonings and anything deep fried.  I love experiencing different tastes and trying new things...as long as they're not vegetables.  No veggies, except corn and potatoes; those two get a pass.  My diet consists primarily of meat, bread and fruit.\n* I firmly believe that breakfast offers the best food.  I could eat waffles everyday.\n* You won't catch me running unless something is chasing me.  Partially because I have asthma, but mostly because running is awful.\n* I used to go to the gym everyday to stay in shape but had to stop when I had to have a medical procedure done.  I'd like to go back, but I work so much that I rarely have time anymore.\n\nOver the past several years I've come to appreciate music a lot more than I used to (before it was simply used as background noise as I can't stand silence) and have discovered that I'm a fan of alt-metal more than anything else.  Some bands I enjoy include Breaking Benjamin, Three Days Grace, Shinedown, Disturbed, Five Finger Death Punch, Theory of a Deadman, Amaranthe, Gemini Syndrome, Evans Blue, Otherwise, Adelitas Way, Pop Evil, Sevendust and things along those lines.  I enjoy other types of music as well, for example another band I like is Bowling for Soup as I love their sense of humor; it's great to see people not taking making music too seriously.  I'm also a huge fan of big band music, which I actually have Fallout 3 to thank for.  I enjoy classical musical as well and, despite having no real knowledge of it and most of it sounding the same, I find it incredibly relaxing and peaceful.\n\nGaming is easily one of my biggest hobbies and has been for many, many years now.  I don't see it simply as a way to, as some people might say, pwn noobs (I hate 1337 speak, not to mention trash talk, with a passion. Play hard, play fair and play for fun, that's my motto.)  I see it as an art form, as a way to tell a story that you can deeply immerse yourself in and get pulled into, something that can captivate you and make you lose all track of time because it's simply so engrossing.  It's also a damn good way to have fun and kill time, especially when you're playing with friends.  My favorite genres would probably be MOBAs, RPGs, strategy, simulation, and shooters.  It's a big part of my life and something I have spent quite a bit of time and money on.  Some people may be put off by this, but it a part of me that I will not deny or hide; after all, if someone has an issue with that then how compatible could we possibly be?\n\nNot only that, but I've also gotten into tabletop gaming, including both board and pen and paper games (such as Dungeons and Dragons.)  I initially got into the latter as an exercise to flex my creative muscles but found it was a fun way to goof off with friends.  For the former, it's almost gotten to the point that I enjoy them more than most video games as it provides an experience that you don't get anymore; friends gathered around and competing against one another or cooperating against a common foe, something that's disappeared with the advent of the internet.\n\nI enjoy reading as well, although I find it difficult to find a book that can keep my focus and really draw me in like I crave.  I'm constantly on the prowl for new material, and my favorite genres would probably be apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic, dystopian, horror and dark fantasy/grimdark, although I'm certainly in the market for something that has a good element of humor to it as well.  If you have any recommendations, I'd absolutely love to hear them!\n\nOverall, I believe it's safe to say that most people would classify me as a \"geek\", not that it's totally inaccurate.  Bring up video/board/tabletop games, super powers, comics, cartoons, anime, manga, sci-fi, fantasy or technology and I'll happily chat your ear off. I'm quite social and love to talk, however I'm also an introvert so there are plenty of times where the pressure of constant social interactions with others gets to me and I need to take some time to myself to mentally recharge.\n\nAs for religion and politics, I tend to try to stay away from both.  For the former, I'm agnostic, which means that while I don't believe in any god or gods, I acknowledge that they might exist.  While I'm 99.3\u03053\u03053\u0305% certain that there is no grand creator or afterlife, there's no real way we can know for certain.  We're a very young and ignorant species, there's much about life and the universe that we don't know.  For the latter, if I had to choose, I'd say I definitely lean towards the Democrat side.  I believe in the greater good, the needs of the many over the needs of the few, in advancing science and finding alternative fuels and materials that don't pollute or destroy our environment in the process, in trying to create a brighter future, etc etc.  I'm definitely not on the far left however, social justice warriors are absolutely ridiculous.  I'm empathetic and all, but people need to stop getting offended by every little thing and focus on real issues.\n\nI try my best to live by The Golden Rule (also known as treat others you the way you wish to be treated or do unto others as you would have them do unto you), being guided by own moral compass that directs me in how I interact with others.   I always do my very best to make others feel wanted, cared for, appreciated and understood, to give them validation; I never want anyone to feel left out or unwanted, for any reason at all.  Perhaps it's from my own difficult childhood, since I felt that way when I was young and don't want others to go through the same things that I did.  Whatever the reason, whenever I say or do anything I tend to, without even realizing it, think about how it will affect the other person and the different ways that it could be taken. I strive to treat others with the courtesy and respect that I believe that they deserve.  \n\nAs I mentioned, I have a strong moral compass.  The only problem is, this is true North for my compass; I feel that's the correct way to treat and interact with others, and I believe that's what everyone should do.  So when other people don't act in the way that I believe they should, even though I know everyone is different and everyone has different thoughts, feelings and experiences that led them to those (we are the product of our environments after all), it can bother me.  I've come to realize that this is due to holding myself to extremely high standards, and often holding other people to the same standards to which I hold myself (which can be both good and bad).  This can lead to conflicts with others, sometimes over things that they might feel to be insignificant.  It doesn't happen very often though as I can recognize whether something is actually a big deal or not and put it to the back of my mind as there's no need to nitpick over every little thing; I wouldn't be a very good friend or partner if I did that constantly, now would I?\n\nI've realized that I used to put a lot of pressure on myself when interacting with others, trying to be funny and entertaining, overall trying to make sure that they were having a good time and enjoying themselves.  If, for whatever reason, I felt that they were bored I ended up trying even harder to keep them engaged and joyful.  It was somewhat of a bad habit of mine; I suppose I just felt like I had a personal stake in everyone that I interacted with, a responsibility almost, and didn't want to leave them wanting. I still do this to some extent, but not as much as I used to; as I've grown and matured, and my anxiety has lessened, I've learned to pull back a bit and that I don't need to carry everyone's burden on my shoulders.  I still wish to keep people engaged and happy, and still take on more responsibility than I probably should, however I imagine that I'll always be that way; it's just in my nature.\n\nI never claimed to be perfect; I have my flaws as well, and try to work on them every day to improve myself as a person.  Since I've already put so much of myself into my profile, I thought that it was only right to put the negative parts in as well.\n\nWhile some of these things could be considered negative traits, I believe that they help make me the Dom that I am.  Because I AM so compassionate, because I AM so empathetic, I feel that I can give a sub or a slave what she truly needs to thrive in her environment.  Feel free to read more about that below.\n\n\n### My Beliefs\n\n\nIf I had to break down why this all appeals to me to one reason, I believe, to put it simply, I'd have to say that I'm the kind of person who needs to be needed. I find that, overall, I feel more driven and fulfilled if I know that I have someone that depends on me and needs me, someone whose best interests I must keep in mind, who I need to protect and care for. I feel a greater sense of purpose than the humdrum rumblings of everyday life. \n\nWhen you combine that with my nurturing and empathetic personality this type of relationship is the natural choice for me (more on that next). I believe that's also why I find myself naturally drawn to the weak, the helpless and the damaged. I have an overwhelming desire to heal them, to help and protect them while nurturing them and watching them grow into who I know they can be, which goes with what I was saying before.\n\nA sub knows that her Dom loves her unconditionally and only wants what is best for her.  While I do certainly enjoy doing this, I primarily do this to help my sub above all else.   I'm a nurturing soul who wishes nothing more than to nurture and protect his partner. To take care of her and help her when she needs it. To be her support and her life line. To give her the guidance, structure and discipline she needs to feel fulfilled in life. To set rules and guidelines so that she can move freely within those set limits and be happy.  To help her decide what is best for her when she herself doesn't know. To provide the security and comfort of knowing that she is being taken care of and that she has someone she can talk to about anything without any sort of judgment or prejudice.  I want her to thrive and become the person that she was always meant to be.  I enjoy pushing my sub to explore her boundaries and limits, within reason of course. I simply wish to see her flourish and blossom, to help her become what I know she can be and reach higher plateaus.\n\nI realize the previous paragraphs could sound condescending in some ways, however that couldn't be further from the truth.  I see my partner as an equal, someone who simply has different needs that I can fulfill so that they can live a fulfilling life themselves, and in turn by fulfilling those needs of theirs, I feel fulfilled as well.  We ultimately form a symbiotic relationship of sorts.\n\nSome believe that being a Dom is just telling people what to do and getting what you want, but it's so much more than that. It's not as easy or simple as it appears, you must always keep what is best for your sub in mind, even if it conflicts with your own immediate or future interests. You must constantly be aware of her needs and desires while providing checks and balances to help her live a life worth living. Anyone can simply give a sub what she wants, it takes a true Dom to say no because you know that is what is best for her.\n\nAt least that's how it should be. There are so many \"Doms\" out there that don't care about their subs at all, only themselves.  They don't care if they're suffering physically or emotionally, they simply use them as toys they can play with and then toss aside when they're bored; they abuse them and hurt them simply because they get a kick out of it.  A real Dom/sub relationship is a very special and strong bond, much more so than a vanilla relationship in my opinion. So many people seem to have issues understanding that unfortunately, there's a certain stigma associated with this and preconceptions are formed before they even learn anything about it.\n\nTruthfully, I believe the sub holds the power in the relationship in many ways.  She is the one that is choosing to submit after all, to give up her power and control to the Dom.  Despite that, she is the one that has control over the power of safe words, that can stop an activity with a single utterance.  Her subservience is completely voluntary, something that many people don't seem to think about.  It's not simply about someone bossing someone around because they can, it's about someone choosing a partner that they feel is worthy to give their all to.\n\nWhile I admit that I've toyed with the idea of having a family type dynamic, I'm strictly monogamous.  I have no interest in having multiple partners or a harem.  How is a sub supposed to feel special, loved, and important if she is simply number three of five?  A sub is expected to be completely loyal and devoted to her Dom, to have only him and no one else, is it so bad for a sub to want the same thing? Not to mention that I am not simply looking for a sub, I am also looking for a soul mate, if you will. Someone that I can spend my life with. I only want one person to love and care for, not to mention that juggling girls is just WAY too much work, you know?\n\n\n### What I'm looking for\n\n\nI'm not here looking for a booty call or one night stand, but to find a potential partner in crime, possibly for life is a connection is made.\n\nSome people have their entire lives revolve around the lifestyle, going to munches, conventions, parties and attempting to reach out to their community and find a place to belong.  That might work for them, but it's of no interest to me.  While I'm certainly not opposed to chatting and making friends and connections, I have no desire to be a part of a community.  I'm simply seeking one whose ideas and beliefs line up with my own for a symbiotic relationship as I mentioned before.\n\nIf I had to describe such a relationship, it would definitely be on the lighter side of the spectrum in regards to what daily life would be like.  I'm seeking a 24/7 TPE, however I also enjoy being casual with my sub.\n\nIn my perfect situation, we would still be able to joke around, have fun and be very close and romantic; however there is also the constant understanding that I am in charge, and what I say goes.  No matter how much fun we may be having or what we might be doing, she should always know her place, even if it's only in the back of her mind.  There are rules in place for her benefit, and if she breaks those rules she will be punished.  \n\nBy what I say goes, I mean I have the final say in subjects because, as a submissive, she has given the reins of power over to me.  She trusts me to make her decisions for her and to do what is best for her, to take care of and protect her.  I'm never the type to say \"this is how it's going to be, I don't care what you want, end of discussion\" as I believe discussion is the only way two people can truly understand one another.  I always value my submissive's input and always want her to give her opinion and speak her mind if something is bothering her.\n\nMy ideal sub would be one that is loyal and devoted above all else, but also one who is looking for a Dom she can actually have a connection with. One that, not necessarily needs, but craves guidance, support, structure and discipline in their life; whose life does not feel complete without this, like there is a void deep inside her that cannot be filled unless she has a Dom to guide and take care of her, that she can in turn make happy and serve to the best of her ability.\n\nBeyond anything else though, I want to like them as a person before I love them as a sub. My ideal partner would be someone who is intelligent, kind-hearted, earnest, funny and a has a fair touch of dorkiness in her. I want her to be someone that actually has personality, that I can laugh with and talk to for hours upon hours on end and still hate the thought of leaving. Someone that will either indulge my love of games and geekery or join me because she's just as much of a fan of those things as I am. Someone who loves how I tease and torment her, keeping her on the edge and revelling in the pleasure I get from watching her squirm.\n\nOne thing to note is that just because I am very friendly (sometimes people are surprised when I begin acting more Dominant, others aren't as they say they can \"sense it in the way I present myself\", even while being friendly and joking around) doesn't mean that I'm not strict when I have to be. I have no problem at all with enforcing rules and giving out punishments, although it's certainly not my favorite aspect of the relationship. I would prefer to reward, encourage and nurture my sub, however there are times when discipline is necessary; if one feels the need to act up, one must be ready accept the consequences after all.\n\n**I also have quite the kinky side despite my friendly and charming exterior which I suppose I should list here because, while certainly not the primary focus of my interest in this, sexual compatibility does factor in to some extent.  This is the whole reason for the NSFW tag.**  I'm into orgasm denial, forced orgasms, consensual non-consent, teasing, edging, begging, hypnosis, cock worship, body worship, hair pulling, slapping, spanking, choking, biting, blowjobs, deep throating, face fucking, anal, light bondage, name calling, dirty talking, degradation and humiliation.  That\u2019s all I can think of at the moment.\n\n**I feel like I've rambled on enough already and am dangerously close to having a TL;DR (yeah, I hit that ages ago), so I'll just say that if you're interested in learning more about me and getting to know me, you can give me a message and we'll see where things go.  I like to just talk with people, get to know them and see where things lead naturally, whether that be a short chat, a simple friendship or something more.  It seems silly to have expectations when you don't even know the person or how you'll get along.**  \n\n**Even if you're nervous or anxious, you think you might not be good enough, doubt my intentions or anything along those lines, still give me a message.  After all, what do you have to lose?**\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my little novella, I hope to hear from you soon.

He's an entrepreneur trying to get his first LLC and open a facility. I quit my job to help him run the day to day operations while he works his full-time job.\n\nBut I wanted a kid so badly. I'm recently divorced. My ex and I always said that when I turned 30, we'd talk about having a family, that way I could do fertility treatments if necessary and have a baby before I'm 35. But then he decided he never wanted a family and that, among other things, caused us to get divorced. \n\nThe other night, my boyfriend and I were talking in bed, and I told him about all of this. About how I'll be 30 soon and how I've had this goal for years, but now everything is different. We aren't married (and he wants to do things traditionally -- marriage first, then children), how we have the business, blah blah blah. He basically said, yes, we'll have a family someday, but not any time soon. \n\nWell, then I got my BFP... It was instant. I barely had time to put the cap back on and set it down before the positive sign showed up. And when I asked him what he thinks we should do, he said if he had a vote, he doesn't think we're ready. There will be plenty of time to have a kid, but right now, we have so much going on and so much stress and obligations that this just isn't the right time. \n\nWhich, I must admit, was not the answer I wanted to hear. I've always dreamed that I'd tell the father I'm pregnant, and he'd be so happy that he'd hug me or cry or something else cheesy like that. And he didn't do that. He said whatever I decide, he'd support me 100%, and he'd love our baby and provide for it, and we'd make it work, but... He isn't happy. And I want him to be happy. So I don't know what to do. \n\nDo I just need to give him time? Is this a bad sign when the father isn't happy?

I'm looking for a game that will make it to high levels, one that we can truly grow from inconsequential adventurers to major political players. \n\n**On video:**\nI'm a firm believer in video chat for online D&amp;D. We've all heard the 7% rule, that actual interpersonal communication is only around 7% done via the literal words we use. Keeping this in mind, I found DMing my own games that after I required my group to use video, interruptions and misunderstandings went way down, players got less frustrated at others who were \"hogging the spotlight\", they were able to come up with more sophisticated plans, and probably a whole bunch of other things I didn\u2019t notice. D&amp;D is such a cooperative, communicative social game that enforcing a communication-handicap like this is such a shame to me. I know some people get shy about the idea of showing their faces to strangers on the internet, but this has actually been just the opposite in the cases I\u2019ve seen - once you see someone\u2019s face, it\u2019s like, \u201cah, they\u2019re just a person too\u201d. Empathy goes way up and people get comfortable and break out of their shells. \n\n**And me:**\nI\u2019m a pretty big geek. I grew up having LAN parties on the weekends when I wasn\u2019t away at marching band competitions. Later, I got the chance to teach English in Japan and eventually got to live and work there as a translator. I\u2019m big on roleplaying games (most recent are the 3DS Fire Emblem games) and grew up with lots of the classic titles: Final Fantasies, Zeldas, Fire Emblem, and so on. I\u2019m also a big sci-fi and fantasy reader. Just a few titles I\u2019ve gone through are the first 8 Drizzt books, the first 4 Gunslinger books, Legend of Corum, Lord of the Rings, Song of Ice and Fire and most of the 1000 worlds stories, Earthsea, Nightfall, and a bunch of others. All this said, I really enjoy both the mechanical and creative sides of D&amp;D and would love to be able to really get into both of them. I really enjoy engaging with backstories, trying to solve language puzzles, and interacting with the world. I even created a wiki for the last campaign world I was in and helped keep it up to date (I found this to be an awesome way for the players to essentially share notes btw. I highly recommend this for any DMs that run custom worlds).\n\nAnyway, that should give you a decent idea of who I am and what kind of player you can expect out of me. Feel free to send me PMs, I\u2019m happy to talk about your secret plans for world domination there! &lt;3\n\nThanks for reading.\n-Andy\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"lfg","subreddit_id":"t5_2rcvr","subreddit_subscribers":36179,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[Online][5thEd] 33y/o semi-experienced player LFG a long term game high level game, pref video and adult but flexible","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/811gr8/online5thed_33yo_semiexperienced_player_lfg_a/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

I only used to watch those anime's as well. Then I got interested in Kuroko no Basket. I liked the manga and show, but it lacked a sort of realism that took me away from it. Kuroko got me into playing basketball at my gym, but I never really liked it. Its a sort of competitive sport I don't like ever since walking away from Soccer in highschool and rowing instead.\n\nThen I found Haikyuu on a fornever world video. He suggested it, and I liked the art. So I started watching. This was back when the second season was about to come out. And man I was hooked from episode 1. The level of sorrow I had when they lost to Sejoh, and then enthusiasm I had for when they beat them was incredible. I have had these \"arm pump saying 'Yeah!!'\" ever so often during crazy one piece situations.\n\nI recently found a group of people that I work with and we started playing sand volleyball on Tuesday nights. I live next to the beach in a hot climate, the culture down here is more into beach than indoor. I was bad in the beginning, but after a 2 months I went from being last pick to second to last pick. My friend, who has played in college clubs, is 6 foot 8 inches and I am 5 foot 11 inches. One night, he gets a perfect toss and does a run up. I then run up from back line and help my friend to double block him. I get the block and shove it down. I turned around to see my teammates and I jump into another friends arms screaming. \n\nWith that motivation and the idea of getting better for myself I Started practicing by-myself in my back yard. For a month now, at exactly 4:30pm-6pm everyday. I go into my backyard and practice everything from blocks, setting, run-ups, and recently jump serving. After 3 weeks, I can now jump serve and get it over the net 70% of the time.\n\nLast night, when we were playing. I hit my jump serves 90% over and scored a few no touch aces as well as regular aces. I haven't been this proud of an accomplishment though hard work in a long time. I say that as I am about to graduate uni in May and get into med school.\n\nSo to end this long post, I just wanted to thank you Furudate sensei and everyone that helps with Haikyuu. You made a great story, something that has changed my life.\n\np.s. There are a few med schools I can get into, but if they don't have sand volleyball near it, I ain't going there. ;)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"haikyuu","subreddit_id":"t5_2ygi4","subreddit_subscribers":10092,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Thank you Haikyuu and Furudate","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/haikyuu/comments/811i9g/thank_you_haikyuu_and_furudate/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

I posted on here awhile ago about my JNM.. who is a JNMIL to my poor hubby. I'm an a nostalgic mood I guess.. so I will write a bit about her. I think I will name her Ursula if that's ok, cuz she kinda looks like the sea witch\ud83d\ude02\n\nSooo long I had been deep in the fog.. for about 33 years. My mother is overbearing and enmeshed.. but for the sake of keeping things on the shorter side I will stick to things she has done regarding my hubby. \n\n1. Criticising his appearance, weight, personality every time she sees him ( he's on the quiet side and she is loud and he doesn't smile or talk to her enough).\n2. Accusing him of not taking care of the family because he doesn't make enough $$ ( he makes enough to where I only work PT). \n3. Accusing him if being too protective of me and our kid ( because he shows me physical affection in front of her and \"held our son too much when he was a baby\".\n4. Accused him of stealing me away from the faaaamily.\n5. Accused him and his mom of making a \"face\" at her when she said something a thanksgiving 3 years ago. ( This is really one of the biggest things to her).\n6. She calls me and bitches about him the next day after she sees him, every single time.\n7. She has called me and demanded to know how much $$ he makes cuz she's so \"worried\" he can't provide.\n\nThere's more.. and more she's done to me in my past, including making up horrible nicknames of all my boyfriend's when I was in my teen years and being so proud of it. Screaming matches as soon as I got home from school because \"people called her right away and told her all the bad things I was planning on doing\" which wernt true.. leading to my battle with depression and suicide because the screaming was daily for like 8 mos. She also uses me as her emotional shoulder for everything including when my dad was an alcoholic when I was a baby, his emotional affair he had when I was teen.. and their sex life.\n\nAnyway, to the here and now. The extinction burst started with Facebook about 6 mos ago. I posted a pic of me and a friend she didn't like. She immediately called me demanding I take it down. I refused. Ended up hanging up on each other. Dude, I'm 33.. stop. \n\nLed to me having enough with allllll of it. The taking bad about my hubby, treating me like a child. Everything. Sent her a text telling her so.. really nicely but authoratitive (therapist agreed I wasn't too harsh). She DARVO'D like no body's business.. turned things around so she was the victim.\n\nNow usually I would back down... but this time I didn't. As hard as it was for me, I stood my ground. Cuz this is BS high school level shit she's pulling and I ain't having it.  \n\nI try to play nice around the holidays.. and my son's bday\n. And send them well wishing group texts to both mom and dad. Dad replies.. mom doesn't. For everything. \n\nThen mom sends a text simply stating she wants me to bring DS over so she can give him presents. I say, sure.. but we need to talk first to clear the air.\n\nYou guessed it.. talk did not go well. She's spitting venom the whole time and literally says she refuses to talk about my husband AT ALL.  She ends up hanging up on me. \n\nFew months go by.. I get a random guilt tripping text on how horrible I am from keeping her from DS on the holidays and his BDay and how I broke her heart. \n\nNow.. I have sent her  messages to her explaining my side, how I feel and why. I have apologized to her for hurting her feelings. Have I gotten any such apoology. No. Nothing. I'm quite done and preparing myself for her next communication cuz this shit is ridiculous and I plan on telling her so.  \nHave I heard anything from my dad during this time, nothing. Except at the beginning of it all where he said \" your mom has her opinions and if you want a caring mom you will deal with it\" and \"one day you will understand\". I just wanted to to him , \" dude, you don't know the half of what's happened or what she's told me about you so stfu\". \n\nAnyway.. it's been. About 6 months. The first few months were rough. Rollercoaster of depression,  guilt, anxiety, panic attacks. Horrible panic attacks. Funny thing is.. like now.. I'm just like whatever.

My husband is a great guy, and I have zero beef with him as a person, which is the first time I can say that at the breakup point. I've just realized that I don't want to be poly anymore, and I *do* think I want kids. He wants the opposite on both of those fronts.\n\nThe reason I tried to be poly in the first place is that, like clockwork, my sexual desire for a partner seems to fade around the 2.5-year mark. When I was younger and less ethical, I used to cheat, but it's been a long time since I've done that, and I'd never do it again.\n\nOn the one hand, I feel like maybe it's a flaw in me, that my desire fades. On the other hand, I wonder if maybe my body just knows something that my mind does not\u2014that the relationship is no longer right for me and I'd be happier in a different situation. Or, whether the relationship has *always* been wrong for me, but the initial puppy-love phase just blinds me to that.\n\nI do know that historically, I've tended to \"excuse\" gaps between the person I'm with and what I want, once I like them. It's caused me to end up in some situations that really chafed once the fuzzies wore off. \n\nMoving backward in time (before current husband), with the reason I ultimately left:\n\n- A 3.5-year relationship with someone who pathologically lied to me for most of it.\n- A 3.5-year relationship with someone (first husband) who said hypercritical and cruel things to me often, and needed (but was refusing to take) antidepressants\n- A 2.5-year relationship with a 15-years older person who pressured me into sex situations I was uncomfortable with\n- A 2.5-year relationship with someone struggling with meth addiction who lied and cheated on me\n- A 1.5-year relationship with someone who had anger management issues and was occasionally physically abusive\n\nOf course, I look at the above list and go, \"Duh, *of course* I didn't want to keep having sex with *those guys*. But the problem was that I couldn't seem to work up the courage to actually leave until I had someone waiting in the wings (not necessarily the next guy on that list, but maybe a fling). The cycle was something like this:\n\n1. Fall for a jerk\n2. Stay madly in love with him, overlooking his red flags and trying to make it work for ~2.5 years\n3. Eventually fall out of love but stay out of comfort\n4. Get sexually tempted by someone else since I was no longer in love and not really interested in sex with the jerk anymore\n5. Leave the relationship and take up with someone else\n\nAnd the cycle would repeat.\n\nFor a long time, I didn't notice the \"jerk\" pattern in there. I thought I just had issues with monogamy. I lose sexual desire? I'm tempted to cheat? Maybe I'm polyamorous!\n\nSo when I met and befriended my current husband, on the way out of my relationship with the pathological liar, and my husband was doing a near-poly thing already, dating three other women, I jumped at the chance to try poly. \n\nAnd, it turned out, for once, *this guy* is not a jerk. In fact, he's the sweetest person I ever met, even though poly itself made me miserable. But I still lost desire for him after 2.5 years. And I still had someone new turn my head once I lost that desire (someone who also struggled with poly and decided it wasn't for him). I probably should have bailed on poly sooner, before my husband became my husband. In fact, I maybe shouldn't have picked up with my husband in the first place, because I was on the fence about having kids and his not wanting them partially influenced me because I liked him so much. But lo and behold, the urge resurfaced.\n\nThe kicker is the new guy kinda struggles with substance issues too, so he may end up being a jerk-in-waiting. The jury is out on that one, and I've made a hard boundary with him around that stuff. That relationship won't even make it anywhere close to the 2.5-year point if he keeps that up, so at least I'm getting smarter.\n\nBut the questions I'm asking myself:\n\n1. Why do I go so gung-ho for people who aren't suitable partners (either because of a character flaw or wanting different things)?\n\n2. Would I still lose desire if I miraculously picked someone more suitable? Like, is this something *in me*, or is it something in the situation and my choice of partners?\n\n3. Why am I so lazy/afraid about cutting the cord even after I've recognized the problem? I'm not gonna do that this time (aforementioned hard boundary), but why have I done so much of that?\n\n4. Obviously it's good to make relationships last, but only if they are relationships that *should* last\u2014it's not healthy to keep trying to make relationships last that have glaring incompatibilities. So how do I even find good partners?\n\nIf it turns out that I do have to end things with New Guy, I'm planning on not dating at all for a while, just to figure this shit out. But I'm looking for advice/recommendations from anyone on here who might have ideas about books to read, websites to visit, etc. Also anyone who has a similar story and can let me know how they've come through it.\n\nWhat I ultimately want is a healthy relationship that can last a long time, and hopefully before my reproductive window closes. I plan to just kind of work on myself until I figure this shit out.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"selfhelp","subreddit_id":"t5_2qho7","subreddit_subscribers":28355,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"How to pick good partners and make relationships last...","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/811iut/how_to_pick_good_partners_and_make_relationships/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

I've been no contact (still) since before Christmas and I had been doing so good, but this feels like it's set me back some and it bums me out. \n\nI also ended up watching a home video I found yesterday from when I was only a few years old. It was really bittersweet because my deceased (maternal) grandparents were in it and it felt surreal hearing their voices. They both died within a month of each other a few years back and this is where my mom's mental illness really came to a point. Their deaths were all about her, so watching the video finally unleashed a flood of tears out of me. I could mourn finally, alone in peace, without her making it a competition of how much more sad she was. \n\nWatching my grandmother in the video brought up some crazy feelings too. She was uBPD too as well as an alcoholic, but she hid it really well from me until I was a pre-teen. I have vague memories of her pulling the same stunts on my mom as my mom has pulled on me. Including writing manic letters and leaving them at our house, leaving vicious voicemails, name calling etc. I didn't really realize it cause I was young, But even with that, I still feel in my heart my mom has become a even worse monster. My grandmother eventually did lash out at me and now I can realize that my mom would purposely \"send me to the frontlines\" to deal with my manic grandmother when she couldn't be pissed to handle it herself. Just awful to think about since I didn't deserve to deal with that. \n\nI also remember my mom reeling and being so upset about the things my grandmother did and said, yet here she is in 2018 saying worse things to me. All these feelings have come up but I still feel like I am doing the right thing by going no contact. I won't let my son be part in a continuing cycle of dysfunction. It's sickening to even think about exposing him to that stuff. \n\nI know that UBPD mom still is playing like she is a wonderful grandma to people, though I know people don't know she has been cut off from my little family. That's another part of my anger. I find myself furious that she couldn't just pull herself together, get help when LO was a newborn, and be a grandmother that LO deserved. I had given her the chance before this last blow up. She had to continue being selfish and hateful to everyone. She chose to dabble in hard drugs and act like a entitled brat, putting on her fake act of being this better-than-thou, generous with money, middle-class housewife when in reality she is a hateful, cruel, and terrible mother. She is the biggest fake I know, A grandmother that looks at her grandson as a trophy to show off for and with. \n\nAnd mostly I am quite pissed that I won't ever have the mother I need. I won't have someone to spend time LO when I need the help. The kind of mother that can support me through my own journey in motherhood. I won't have a mother I can call and chat with about things going on with me. I won't have a mother that loves endlessly, and embraces me with encouragement and happiness. \n\nInstead I have a mother who has told me my college degree is useless. I have a mother that has torn me down by calling me a piece of shit and a bitch. I have a mother who tried to sabotage my marriage and turn my husband against me. I have a mother who made negative comments about my breastfeeding journey. I have a mother that talked about her crappy iPhone in the video of me birthing my son at exactly the time he was born(yea, seriously she did). I have a mother that thinks doing meth is no big deal and I need to get over her doing it. I have a mother that has taken away my (e) dad from me. He won't ever chose me, his daughter. over her. She has robbed me of time with him and she has torn our family apart while pointing the finger at me. \n\nInstead I have been dealt this hand and while it's lonely and sad, it's for the best.

I live with my parents, and I don't currently have any real expenses beyond gas.  I am not in debt of any kind.  While my parents have been generous in allowing me to stay rent-free, and paying for my community college classes (I've been taking classes part-time since high school, I have roughly 2 full semesters under my belt), we don't get along great, and I really don't like where I live (Northern VA).  My plan is to move to the Denver, Colorado area within the next few months, after this semester finishes up in May.  I have an offer for an $18 an hour position doing the same job I'm doing now.  I plan on finding a room in a shared house.  Ideally, this would be around $500 a month, but my upper limit would be $700.\n\nI have:\n\n$6000 cash \n\nA car that I would be able to sell for at least $15,000, probably a grand or two more (2011 mustang gt with ~50,000 miles).  It was paid for in full, but my parents very generously paid for half of it.  I have yet to discuss selling it with them, but I'm operating under the assumption that they would in turn want half of the money I get from selling it.  This would leave me with roughly $13,000 total, including my savings.\n\nI want to buy an older (04-ish) ford ranger 4x4 in decent condition.  I've been looking online for a while, and I'll probably be able to find one for not more than 5 or 6 thousand dollars.  This will leave me with about $7000.\n\n$18 an hour full time in Colorado will leave me with $2482 a month after taxes.  Below is a rough plan I've come up with for where all that will go:\n\nRent: (up to) $700\nFood: $250\nCar Insurance: $150\nPhone: $50\nGas: $300 (I plan on spending most of my free time hiking and exploring the state, so I'm putting in a very high estimate)\nSavings: $500\nSpending money: $500\n\nI plan on using my savings for unforeseen expenses like car repairs or a broken phone.  My parents are currently paying for my phone and my car insurance, and they might be willing to continue to do so.  However, I'm not counting on it.  If they're willing to, that would be an extra $200/mo going to savings.  I'm going to be on my mother's health insurance plan until I'm 26.\n\nSo is this realistic? I've ran the numbers over and over, and I really do think it'll be feasible.  I know that a lot of the numbers I've provided are estimates, but I've done my best to make conservative ones.  Is there anything I've failed to consider?  Do I need a reality check?  Finally being out of my parent's house would be a dream come true.

I should have ended our relationship four years ago, instead I wasted her time because I am selfish and stupid.\n\nSo since the last post, my ex-girlfriend (let's call her Kate) and I have been awesome. We've both finished school, and have full time jobs in our fields. Kate is still as Christian as ever, if anything she spends more time in church than before, she says she loves having the opportunity to serve God's people. I go with her sometimes, to various events/outreach services, its nice and her church is full of good people who seem genuine enough. I don't attend any services still but Kate really loves when I come to help out and I love making her happy of course. So a year ago I bought a house, that we picked out together because it is a home we expected to share together one day soon. Kate lives with her parents, but spends about 3 nights a week (usually weekends) with me at my house. We've been back and forth about this because I'm 26 years old and I think the idea of her living with her parents at this stage of our lives/relationship is absurd regardless of religion. Kate understands this of course but explained to me that women in her family just don't move out unmarried but had agreed to move in with me once we're engaged officially, as a compromise which I said was okay. We've thoroughly discussed getting engaged soon, since we're coming up on our 10 year dating anniversary. I bought the ring months ago and just needed to come up with a plan for a proposal and whatnot. I toyed with the idea of showing up to her mission trip overseas this summer and surprising her, and had even discussed the logistics of this with her parents and her pastor.\n\nFast forward to January of this year, a month or so ago. I was out with some friends and I ran into an old friend of mine, a girl I hadn't seen since my freshman year of college (say, Molly). We're hanging out as a largish group and we're all getting drunk (I invited Kate out to this but she told me to have fun with my friends). Long story short I get wasted and I end up sleeping with Molly, it was so stupid and the next morning I had never been so disgusted with myself. I came totally clean to Kate immediately when I saw her. She cried of course, she asked me if I had feelings for Molly at all, I told her no and she said, as long as I wasn't in love with someone else then she could forgive me. She said that we all fall short sometimes and that she loved me and we could move past it. So that was that and we did. Or I thought we did. \n\nSomething snapped in me, I don't know if I'm going through an actual crisis or I'm just an asshole but I did it again and again. For absolutely no reason. The sex wasn't particularly noteworthy and I care zero about Molly as more than a means to an end. Over the course of 6 weeks, I slept with Molly maybe 20 times. While sleeping with Kate when she was over my house and keeping up appearances that everything was A okay. Kate definitely noticed something was up with me, but she misread it completely. Once even telling me, I didn't have to feel guilty for what I had done (the one time she knew about) because she had forgiven me and I should forgive myself. She went out of her way for weeks to give me extra attention, spending a ton of time at my house, booked us a vacation, all of that. Just being her usual loving self, not knowing what I was up to at all. \n\nIt hit the fan one night that I told Kate I was meeting my friends (aka Molly) at the bar, she'd been busy between work and church and hadn't seen me in like a week but we had plans to hike the next day, and I was supposed to pick her up from her parents house in the morning. I stumble into my house with Molly at like 4am and there's Kate waiting on my couch. She had a shirt of Molly's in her hand that had been left there one of the times I slept with her in my house..I'll never forget the look in her eyes when we walked in. I'd never seen a person look so crushed. I wanted to vomit. What she said next I'll never forget either. She looked at me and asked me if I was okay. I was shocked and confused. She went on to say that, something must be seriously wrong with me if I was willing to hurt her so deeply when I loved her so much. She said that she was sorry I was hurting so badly and went on to apologize for whatever she had done to make me feel like I couldn't share my feelings with her without judgement. I couldn't believe that she was seriously standing there trying to comfort me after what I had done. I knew in that moment that I couldn't continue with our relationship. I feel like I understand now what David meant four years ago when he told her we were unequally yoked or whatever. The heart that Kate has, I will never be able to match. She is too good, too kind, too everything. So when she looked over at Molly (drunken zombie on my couch at this point) and asked if I had feelings for her, I said yes. It was 100% a lie but I didn't know how to say the truth. How could I look at Kate, this wonderful, perfect woman who has comprised her beliefs on my behalf time and time again and tell her that I can't be with her because I am intimidated by her capacity to love? That I will never have that in me to return to her? She deserves someone who can match what she gives, who has a heart like she does. Compared to her I feel like a shell of a person, I feel like I have been going through the motions for years, just empty. I had to tell her that I had feelings for Molly because the kind of person Kate is, would just keep forgiving me over and over. I know that she loves me so much, and believes in me so much that she would never walk away even though she absolutely has every reason to. She just doesn't give up on people, so I had to decide it for her in that way.\n\nAnyways, Kate turns back to Molly says to her \"I hope he treats you better, I wouldn't wish this feeling on my worst enemy.\" and leaves. She has since blocked me from all social media, and her phone and email. I have been going insane. I regret everything. So many time since I have thought about showing up to her house and begging her forgiveness, but I can't bring myself to do it. I'm just a coward I guess. I did hear from her weeks later. She sent a package to my house with somethings of mine in it. I couldn't help myself, I sent her a text from my business phone saying I hope she's doing well, how guilty i feel for hurting her, yada yada. Her reply was this:\n\n\"I have never felt more wrecked in my life but still God has provided me peace through this storm. It is situations like this that show what we truly believe, and I am thankful for who God is. Even though I never wanted anything like this to be apart of my testimony, I know that if I remain faithful God can use it for good, and I am so thankful for the opportunity to be used by Him despite such a deep, crushing loss. You'll have to find a way to forgive yourself because I have already forgiven you. Remember that grace is not something you can earn, because what you do doesn't make you worthy, we are deemed worthy through Christ. Please, take care of yourself. I will be praying that you find some peace soon. I love you always\"\n\nI couldn't respond because she blocked my work line immediately after sending that but I mean, she is just pure love. I'm in total awe of what she has in her that gives her the ability to be kind to me after all of this.  I will always regret losing that kind of light in my life. \n\nI'm not looking for any advice or anything, I just wanted to share the end of the story. I want to say that all of you who are Christian or whatever religion I guess, and have this faith and love and warmth in you are awesome and I am thankful that you exist in the world. I have never in my life wanted to latch onto that as much as I do now, and I am trying to figure out what exactly that means and what my next steps are. \n\n*At this point I'm not worried about Kate or anyone else seeing this so I'm comfortable with the amount of detail in here.

I've played my part in 4 abortions and 2 miscarriages. All I ever wanted was a family.\" It tore me up to read that because I was so afraid that would be me.\n\nIt's becoming me, or I'm becoming that secret. I'm now 35, male, single, and childless. I've played my part in 2 miscarriages. There was one woman who, 6 years ago, got pregnant after a month of us dating thanks to a broken condom. She said she was keeping it and dumping me. I wasn't going to take a new born away from its mother. I moved away for work, then she moved away to be closer to her family. Before she left I begged her to let me hold my child once, let there be one picture of them in my arms so they would know me not being in their life wasn't their fault. She said no. (If you're reading this, don't blame her. I'm sure she would give a different interpretation of what happened. As far as I know she's a good person and a great mom).\n\nI don't know why I can't find someone to love who loves me enough to accept me and want to have a family with me. I have a master's degree, a clean criminal record, don't do drugs, rarely drink, have my hair, workout/not fat, have a good relationship with my family. I'm a nice guy. I've been told I'm good in bed. I'm so tired of awkward 1st dates from eHarmony or Plenty of Fish. I feel like there's no point in trying to meet someone at a bar since they're usually intoxicated and I'm not, and I'm not going to take advantage of someone's who's drunk. At the end of a date I'm tired of feeling let down and like I just wasted 2 hours and 40$, or feeling excited until they end the date with a 'thanks' and an awkward hug. I'm tired of wondering what I'm doing wrong. I'm tired of crying myself to sleep at night, wishing the pillow I was holding was a woman who loved me.\n\nI get so angry when I go to the gym and I see the type of woman I've always lusted over with a guy who has more muscles than I ever will. No matter how much I lift or how much protein I eat, I'll always look more like a distance runner than a bodybuilder. I'm angry at myself, my metabolism, and the situation. I try to avoid being angry at another person. It's not their fault specifically. That's what makes it worse: it's everyone's fault, no one's fault, and my fault that I'm alone.\n\nI just want a family of my own. I'm so afraid I'll end up alone in some nursing home, being water and fed by minimum wage employees who can't stand me. No one will visit me. I'll die and be forgotten. I want a family to love. I want to give a couple of my kids some of the happy memories my parents gave me. I want something of them to go on, and something of me to go on.

I'm currently adjusting knee angles and looking to find a better grip to avoid bent elbows while also avoiding my pubic bone.

It's hard to put into words, but he stopped eating, stopped socializing, just went to work, got home and went to sleep.

Peanut butter, lunch meat, snack cakes, you name it. This continued for years until the present day, and every time I try to stop her from ruining what I have to eat, my mom starts yelling at me telling me to fuck off and do whatever she wants. My dad is completely opposed to do anything about this because he's afraid my mom will leave again, so he takes her side and allows this behavior to continue. My sister also is not toilet-trained and basically shits and pisses all over the floor in her room which my mom goes in and cleans hours later.

Fun fact, I wear this on my lower lashline and my bitchy coworker told me it looked like I had an eye infection! She's a peach, and hasn't affected my makeup process at all. Looking a little infected is a risk when you wear pink liner. She's still rude though. \n\n2. Something red - Urban Decay mini lipstick in F bomb - this lil sucker is SO CLOSE to being finished, which means in reality I probably have about another month of use. I wear this nearly every day and I love it. I did have to take a break around the beginning of the month, since the air was so dry my lips felt like lizard skin and I had to wear glosses for a week to seal in what little moisture I had. \n\n3. A fragranced product - Physicians Formula Sexy Booster blush, which smells like vanilla - I've realized that this is sheer enough that I can pack it on without looking too nuts, and I'm really digging the shimmer. I don't expect pan on this anytime soon though. \n\n4. Something you love - Maybelline Eyestudio quad in Copper Chic - WE FINALLY HAVE PAN! I was starting to worry these pans were actually bottomless, but I have hit the bottom of the copper shade and I feel so victorious. I'm going to stick with using the copper on my lid every day until the pan is a decent size or I get sick of it. I think the deep brown will be the next to pan, since I use it as a liner and I've been tunneling in with my brush. The bronze is untouched, and the white is being used as a browbone and inner corner highlight. I did try using it as a face highlight once, but it was so intense it was unworkable. No multitasking this one.\n\n5. Something from Lime Crime - liquid lipstick in Cupid - I only wore this once because I've been focusing on the red lipstick. It somehow still has developed a window in the packaging! Is it progress? Is it drying out? I do not know. \n\n6. A hair product - Lush R&amp;B hair moisturizer - I'm starting to see windows to the bottom! It's slow going, since I only wash my hair 2x a week, but the end is in sight. \n\n7. A single shadow - Geek Chic Cosmetics loose shadow in Ambassador - I only used this a couple times since it's a pretty bold red color and I've been focusing so hard on the Maybelline quad. I did, however, use it to make a very good red smoky eye that I wore to a baby shower. I am very good at socially appropriate looks. \n\nSo that's 0 finished or destashed this month, but a couple things feel close. How did all of you do? Progress? Empties? Destashes? Show me your successes so I can forget my low completion rate!

I updated lots of things too, so here we go*\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------o---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1) **INTRODUCTION**\n\n The reason of this post is to introduce you to the 3 crit playstyles for Yi that I crafted and test them out, for a total of 3 builds and 3 rune pages, all of them serving a different purpose imo viable no matter the elo I'm playing at, but rather my team and the enemy's composition will decide which are good and which are bad choices (see \"WHEN TO\" part). Since this post is a bit long, you may skip the argument notes of the runes, but the 'build order details' ones *must be read* to comprehend them, as the order build is not just straightfoward\n\n First I present the runes, then the builds for those runes, and finally when are they strong. The 3 Crit playstyles (meaning of the names I gave them at BUILDS section) are:\n\n- *\"Yellow\", for one shots and pentas, prioritizes dmg;*\n\n- *\"Red\", for movespeed, great map pressure midgame, single target burst, skillshots dodges and counterjg. It moves much faster and deals even more dmg than yellow crit, but to single-targets that are squishies. It's even more useless against tanks than a normal crit Yi*\n\n- *\"Blue\", prioritizes utility (form before strength) such as CDR and mana regen, followed by a bit more of movespeed and attack speed, the entire build is meant to spam abilities, specially the Q, it adapts to almost every scenario (team comps)*\n\nAs a proof that these builds actually work (some ppl ask for it)\n\nhttp://br.op.gg/summoner/userName=HawkeyedYi\n\nhttp://las.op.gg/summoner/userName=king+kong+i\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------o---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2) **RUNES**\n\n[Yellow crit runes](https://i.imgur.com/PdIsshF.png)\n\n[Red crit runes](https://i.imgur.com/Q4mHPDT.png)\n\n[Blue crit runes](https://i.imgur.com/MDKxjNI.png)\n\n**Notes for red crit runes**\n\nAlthough Predator seems like a bad keystone, it has a great base dmg and scales with 40% bonus AD and red crit builds it the most. It matches perfectly with the playstyle too, great movespeed and burst to a single target.\n\nSudden impact and Celerity are 10/10 keystones for this playstyles since they directly power it up. +10 lehality, movespeed and bonus AD based on bonus movespeed\n\nIngenious Hunter is better than Relentless Hunter because I already have a lot of raw movespeed which is being nerfed BY 50% thanks to the movespeed formula, so I'd rather prefer having my keystone and Ghostblade way more often\n\nScorch because there is no other better rune at this secondary tree. I just won't go for the utility or precision trees as secondaries because of how much the Celerity rune is abused here, and it has good early dmg\n\n**Notes for blue crit runes**\n\nSince the playstyle is based on rushing CDR to its cap to spam abilities, the +5% CDR at lv 1 from Cosmic Insight to your abilities AND summoners, such as Flash and Smite, helps you clean a bit faster the jungle, and at mid game when you reach the CDR cap (around min 20) you'll have 45% CDR instead, *which is almost like having your abilities up twice as often as a Yi without CDR (which is very common since ppl almost don't build any CDR on Yi)*\n\nMagical footwear is a really OP rune because not only you have free boots at around min 9 but these have 10 additional movespeed *which would be worth 420g in less than 10 minutes of game*!!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------o---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3) **BUILDS**\n\n[Crit builds](https://i.imgur.com/5J99rnC.png) \n\n**Notes**\n\n**Common Notes** (for all builds)\n\n The pink and sweeping lens at the starter items are there just for comfort, the same for the red consumable and oracle alteration at the end of the build, it doesn't mean I'll purchase them when I'm full build. I take sweeping lens when my trinket is on cd (put it, 80 seconds or more) and when I'm 9 I upgrade it to oracle alteration. If I'm red crit, same goes for the blue ward being there.\n\n **Yellow crit**\n\n*BUILD ORDER DETAILS*: B.F. Sword or Pickaxe -&gt; Zeal -&gt; 300g boots -&gt; IE -&gt; Shiv -&gt; Zeal -&gt; Cloak of Agility -&gt; Phantom Dancer -&gt; sell boots and buy Vampiric Scepter -&gt; sell Hunter's Machete and build Pickaxe / Warhammer -&gt; Death Dance -&gt; Essence Reaver\n\nThe name comes from the first 2 crit items that I rush (IE and Shiv), which are yellow (Because it matches, I play the golden chroma from Headhunter Yi with this)\n\n *The idea behind this build, is to go straightfoward to dmg for one shots. By rushing IE and Shiv, 2-3 kills and a decent farm you can already kill a full hp squishy with Q+AA (if you have the luck that both will crit, which is 1 in 4).*\n\n2 crit items rushed are ok, but why just keep building crit chance subitems and not AD, AS or lifesteal? because by rushing IE and Shiv items, you rely A LOT on crits being proc. If you crit, you deal 250% the normal dmg. If you not, you just waste your IE passive and deal the 100% normal dmg. It happens often that you think you can kill someone with Q + 1 or 2 AA's, but you had the bad luck that just 1 or none of them were actually critical strikes, and even being fed you couldn't one shot your enemy and that costs you your life because you made a dangerous bet, and lost it. Relying on luck is a thing I hate, that's why I want to suppress it, by building Zeal/Cloack from Phantom Dancer and Essence Reaver, right after finishing Shiv. Then I complete Phantom Dancer with 1400g to reach 100% crit chance, that's when I start building lifesteal and CDR\n\n **Red crit**\n\n *BUILD ORDER DETAILS*: Build 2 Poacher's Dirk (or just 1 if it's being hard to steal enemy's jg) during the course of the early-mid game, 1 for Duskblade and the other for Youmuu. When at full build, replace the jg item with Phantom Dancer and then the boots with Essence Reaver\n\n The name comes from combining lethality (which is red themed) with crit. (Because it matches, I play the crimson chroma from Headhunter Yi with this)\n\n *I consider this a whole new viable playstyle, based on movespeed and single target burst damage.*\n\n It deals less dmg against champions that stack armor (for you to know, % armor pen&gt;armor&gt;lethality), so it sacrifices dmg against tanks to deal more dmg against squishy targets.\n\n The movespeed is useful to chase down enemies/escape easily. I put pressure on the map having this amount of out of combat movespeed, I can join fights earlier or go and steal enemy's camps faster when I see that he's ganking a lane, etc, I can even kite some melee champs (because I lack attack speed, I AA, step back, step forward and AA, step back..) and dodge tons of skillshots such as AoE abilities.\n\n **Blue crit**\n\n*BUILD ORDER DETAILS*: If they have few, short and dodgeable cc's, skip QSS and build Death Dance. If not, build QSS and skip Death Dance (and then build into scimitar ofc, but start from QSS) if the enemy team has an undodgeable annoying cc such as Malzahar R or Rammus E, or to deny a chain cc by removing the first cc and then Q/flash/move away from the incoming cc abilities. I sell the 300g boots and then Hunter's Machete when I need to make room in my inventory or to finish an item if I'm lv9+. For the 6th item I either build GA or Dominik/Mortal Reminder (Last Whisper figures on the build because it's their common item and I start building them from it) if they have a lot of armor/health or a lot of armor/heals; or death dance (if I built QSS and skipped Death Dance before)\n\n The name comes from the first 2 crit items that I rush (Essence Reaver and Phantom Dancer), which are blue (because it matches, I play the aqua chroma from Headhunter Yi with this)\n\n *The idea behind this build is to sacrifice early damage for utility. It's intended to be played the most in high elo. Why? You're just a Yi, you Q and AA. They are well aware of what you can do and how to counter you. But this way you're less predictable (since you'll have your Q more often even if you didn't kill anybody, because of your ER's CDR) and less kiteable (because of the +12% total movespeed from Phantom Dancer).*\n\n By rushing Essence Reaver you're able to give blue to mid (thing that you wouldn't do in rare ocasions or if you're smurfing, I guess) since you gain mana from crits, and once you buy Zeal from Phantom Dancer, you won't run out of mana ever again. This is the way to replace Hunter's Talisman mana regen. In fact, IMO it's better since the jungle item only grants you mana against monsters. If you keep using abilities against champions and using Q for minions at lanes, you'll eventually run out of mana (unlike having Essence Reaver's passive) and you won't regain it all like nothing just by clearing a camp.\n\n Just in case someone's wondering, double strikes give you mana as well, but not crit Qs. And by the time you buy it, it gives you around 20 mana per crit, for an average of 4-5 mana per AA, but with Zeal and leveling up it'll give you much more and you won't need to worry about it anymore.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------o---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4) **WHEN TO** (decided at champ select)\n\nTo decide which playstyle is the most viable in a certain game, I share these tips surrounding team comps with you. The one with the most accurate tips is the best option to play. Remember this is defined at champ select once everyone picked their champs\n\n**In common**\n\n- Enemy composition is oriented to damage dealers\n\n- Your team doesn't have too much AD. If so, your enemy squishies will most likely get tabis and other armor items and that's a problem to crit Yi\n\n- They don't have a Zilean/Anivia. The resets after killing someone in a teamfight means a lot for crit Yi and if he doesn't get a reset after killing an ADC/Midlaner he's likely in trouble\n\n**Yellow Crit when**\n\n- Enemy team barely has any cc (so I can take down the enemies by directly engaging)\n\n- I won't give blue to my midlaner/he doesn't need blue\n\n- *Enemy's support is a tank or dmg dealer*. You can 1 shot a dmg dealer, and just outwit the tank support, easily done with Flash+Q, leaving him for the end, even if he puts cc on you it'll be late already cuz you 1 shot their damage dealers. But if they have an utility supp you'll have problems trying to 1 shot their squishies as they'll heal/shield/peel them\n\n**Red Crit when**\n\n- My team lacks AD (if my teams lacks AP and you choose to go Lethality Yi, the enemy team will stack armor because my team has much more AD than AP and that makes lethality useless (armor penetration in % &gt; armor &gt; lethality)\n\n- Their support is a damage dealer\n\n- They don't have annoying point and click cc champs like Rammus/Malzahar or another annoying champion that will cc me easily, since I don't build QSS on lethality Yi because I don't find a good opportunity to build it\n\n- Enemy composition have a lot of skillshots and AoE abilities, so I'll dodge them just by moving, thanks to the great movement speed\n\n**Blue Crit when**\n\n- Enemy team has a Malza/Rammus or any other annoying point and click cc because of the QSS, or a chain cc that'll 100% be focused on me, so I can remove the first cc with QSS and then dodge the incoming cc they won't know I'll avoid\n\n- I'll give blue to my midlaner/he needs blue\n\n- Enemy support is the utility type\n\n- They have many heals/shields, they will likely have exhaust\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------o---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI hope you guys test them out.

However, after receiving my products today, I wanted to ask you all what you would recommend using together daily/nightly and what you recommend using as a weekly treatment? Also, what would you recommend NOT using together?\n\n**I ended up ordering the following products from The Ordinary:**     \n\u2022 Rose Hip Seed Oil     \n\u2022 Granactive Retinoid 5% in Squalane    \n\u2022 Retinol 0.5% in Squalane    \n\u2022 Buffet    \n\u2022 Caffeine Solution 5%+EGCG    \n\u2022 Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2%    \n\u2022 Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA    \n    \n**Skin concerns**    \n1. Texture &amp; Dullness    \n2. Aging (I'm 25, however I am a former smoker, so I am always looking for ways to \"reverse\" the skin damage I stupidly caused)    \n3. Hyperpigmentation (I used to suffer from severe cystic acne in high school and my early 20's, luckily thanks to the miracle product that is Differin, I only have a minor amount of acne scars left, but i stlll have a good amount of sun spots from my sun worshipping tendencies)    \n4. Dark Undereye Circles     \n\n**CURRENT ROUTINE:**\nAs you can see in my current routine below, I have been a big fan of Mario Badescu products and have honsetly seen some amazing results using their products this past year. I was surprised to see how little I saw their products mentioned on here, until I learned about the lawsuits and poor reviews against their products and was horrified! This is a big reason why I am looking to change my routine.\n\n**AM/PM Cleanser:** Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, La Mer Cleansing Foam, or Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser    \n    \n**AM Products:**    \n\u2022 Pixi Glow Tonic    \n\u2022 Mario Badescu Rosewater Spray     \n\u2022 Mario Badescu Cellufirm Drops    \n\u2022 RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Filler (spot treatment on forehead &amp; smile lines)    \n\u2022 Mario Badescu Ceramide Herbal Eye Cream    \n\u2022 Mario Badescu Collagen Moisturizer w/ SPF 15    \n     \n**PM Products:**    \n\u2022 Pixi Glow Tonic    \n\u2022 Mario Badescu Rosewater Spray    \n\u2022 RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Filler (spot treatment on forehead &amp; smile lines)    \n\u2022 Mario Badescu Ceramide Herbal Eye Cream    \n\u2022 Mario Badescu Vitamin C Serum (every other night)    \n\u2022 Neutrogena Hydro Boost Moisturizer     \n    \n**Weekly Treatments:**    \n\u2022 Pixi Glow Mud Mask    \n\u2022 Pixi Glow &amp; Peel Pads    \n\u2022 Differin (spot treatment for any blemishes that pop up. Differin will forever be a HG for me. I have been using it for about 7 years now. It makes new blemishes reduce size or simply disappear overnight for me. It does take some time to really notice it working on acne scars, but it is WORTH THE WAIT!! TRUST ME)    \n\n**Prescriptions:**    \nAs I mentioned, I used to suffer from really bad hormonal cystic acne. The only treatment that actually got rid of my cystic acne for good was 200 mg of Spironolactone daily. I have been taking this for about 3 1/2 years now. Unfortunately, whenever I try to go off of it, the acne always comes back without fail.    \n        \nAny routine recommendations for The Ordinary products I ordered  OR skin care product recommendations in general for the skin concerns I have would be much appreciated!!!\n\n\n\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SkincareAddiction","subreddit_id":"t5_2tbbg","subreddit_subscribers":473170,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[Routine Help] My first The Ordinary haul","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/811y42/routine_help_my_first_the_ordinary_haul/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

If you're like me and see yourself benefitting from nofap financially before anything else like relationships, then you may find my thoughts interesting. But first, a little background on who I am:\n\nMy name is Ed and I'm 19 years old. I've been self-teaching about economics, financial markets around the world and foreign exchange (also known as forex) for the last 4 years, and now my main focus is financial college education and discretionary proprietary trading.\n\nAfter years of studying technical analysis, getting a grasp of the basics as well as discovering my own method of discretionary analysis I have realized that the main component that ruins traders that start going live (trading with real money after fake practice dollars) is their emotions that suddenly kick in harder than before because real dollars are at stake. Almost every professional trader will tell you that at least 70% of success in trading is made up of complete control over emotions, and we all know how hard it can be to control our own emotions sometimes. \n\nThe feeling of losing a significant amount of money is almost as strong as merely putting that money at the risk. We are greedy and emotional animals, and controlling out risk with the clear mind and a vision of a bigger picture (trading capital) comes after years and years of training willpower, technical training and understanding what risks are to be taken for the expected reward... basically risk management which is the hardest thing I've ever learned from the technical side of trading as a profession.\n\nWithout going too much into detail, the main idea is nofap allowing more pure form of energy retention and trains one's willpower. \n\nCurrently watching charts, trading stuff and playing around with forex. My urge feels like a bump similar to what you feel when you wanna cry, but sexual kind. It starts in balls on the first day, and then it moves up to lower stomach, then upper stomach, then your chest, and eventually it reaches your head.... what happens after? Try it yourself and find out. I don't want to spoil the surprise.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"NoFap","subreddit_id":"t5_2skrn","subreddit_subscribers":307462,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Abstinence and financial success in trading international currency markets","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/811yrg/abstinence_and_financial_success_in_trading/","whitelist_status":"promo_specified"}
