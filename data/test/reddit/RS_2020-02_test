I have posted on here before to share a little insight into dating with a serious skin condition. My last few dates ended with them either ghosting me while on the date, or the most creative rejection I had recently was the girl handed me a paper bag full of dog waste then closed the door to her apartment in my face.\n\nThe advice on here I have received is usually the same \"Hey bud work on yourself\" or \"Wait for the right person\". So to cut those replies off right now, I am 40, I have an MBA, make over 100,000 a year and own my own house. I love you all but the private messages can get a little ridiculous with the same cut and paste advice.\n\nWhat is my problem in dating? According to women: I am ugly, short, too nice, old fashioned, more of a friend, and have zero sexual appeal. All in all it doesn't impact my self esteem because I am not afraid to approach women or have a civil conversation with them. It does however make me very depressed since out of 112 women I have had direct conversations with 108 have ended badly, not just rejection, honest to good trying to tear me down. I had 4 that ended nicely, no further dates mind you, instead they were direct and we are still friends. These 4 women are what we call human beings that deserve awards for acting humane.\n\nRecently, I had to go home to deal with the probate of my father's estate, it is a very messy affair with everyone involved trying to take a piece. My father's lawyer wanted to me come in to attend the Council Court proceedings before it proceeds to the High Court to complete the process. While I was waiting to be called, this young lady approached me and started talking to me out of the blue. I was pleasantly surprised that she wanted to learn about me, my interests, and she even complimented me saying I looked sharp in my suit. We talked for about 25 minutes before she was called into the court room, before she got up, she passed me her number without me asking. Of course I thought this was a joke but I took the number anyway, I think she saw this on my face because she made sure to say \"I would like to keep talking\". \n\nOf course after court I texted her back and to make a long story short we spent three magical days together. It turns out she has the same skin condition as me just not as severe, she is able to hide it better than me with makeup. We were able to share our pain about living with it and the dating pitfalls. We parted ways when I had to leave to return home, and we agreed a relationship would not work due to the long distance, plus her family would not approve of me based on religious background, and family is super important to her. I can understand and respect her point of view.\n\nWhile some would see it as another sad ending, I think it is the best thing that has happened to me in awhile. You see I found what I wanted, I found my own \"people\" in her. That is all I really wanted my entire life was to feel like I wasn't the only one feeling this pain, there is at least one person that finds me sexually appealing.

I'm 26 and I experience stutter by phase, but it's getting really manageable.\n\nTo be brief, I wanted to share with you 3 techniques that really helped me :\n\n- self improvement. Find something your really like, and keep a mindset that NO MATTER what happens in your day, how much you stuttered, you have something going on for you. Imagine a light that never fades in yourself. Smile.\n\n- \"calm\" your eyes, and gently accept to gaze in an other person's eyes. Actively listen.\n\n- most importantly : appreciate each words and letter you say. Including the sounds you have the most trouble with. Like some chocolate. This is how I made peace with somes \"P\" and \"D\" sounds.\n\nEDIT :\nThe bad feelings I had due to stuttering were real, I thought I missed out on some things I could do or say. \nTurns out i stuttered most often when I was without a purpose in life, other than fighting with myself and my words. \n\nThose tips, should be viewed organically as something \"alive\", like your own voice. \nThere is no definition of \"best speech\".\nThe most important is to cultivate kindness and playfulness towards yourself. \nFor this, you may take 10 min each time you can, focusing on this \"inner light\" I mentioned. \n\nThe sheer ability to talk on this group, knowing that I made and will make more progress, is a blessing. \nThanks. \nFeel free to reach.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Stutter","subreddit_id":"t5_2scwr","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Stutter","subreddit_subscribers":7534,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My techniques : eyes and appreciation of words","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stutter\/comments\/ewxm3a\/my_techniques_eyes_and_appreciation_of_words\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

This is the first time I've posted here and I felt compelled to just reach out to this community because I have never been close to another stutterer before, and it still feels kind of weird knowing there are others like me out there. \n\n\nI guess I'll just start by saying that I'm 27, and have stuttered since I was about 5 or so from what I remember. Like a lot of us, it started with pretty incessant repetitions in my formative years and eventually developed into moderate to severe blocking.\n\n\nSchool was a nightmare, and I remember feeling so much heartache and pain when I stuttered in front of people. I remember being bullied and looked down upon by my peers, I remember the constant struggle to be accepted. All of these experiences led to inherent belief systems of self doubt and inferiority within myself, which I want to talk about. \n\n\nI feel like this impediment has created this irreversible outlook on life. I feel like it has moulded my mind to have a default setting of insecurity and constant rumination. I'm almost never present with people. I constantly dwell on my blocks and the reactions of others, and it destroys my relationships. I feel so much anger and pain because of my stutter. I feel angry that it won't ever be possible to join in on the social level that the world plays at, to be apart of regular, fast flowing and witty discourse. I feel like an observer. \n\n\nI don't know how these belief systems I hold will become undone, but I cannot possibly see a world where I am completely okay with how I speak. Maybe these thought patterns can be changed, and I know that glimmer of confidence that I have experienced on rare occasions can be expanded on and practiced, but it just feels totally outweighed by my core beliefs. It feels like a tangible sharp pain when I stutter around people, and it seems involuntary. I feel trapped in my mind, you know? \n\n\nAll i want is to express myself freely and to share love in this world (corny, I know), but I can't. I physically and mentally cannot do what I want, and it makes me sad.\n\n\nKnowing I can speak to others out there about this might be the first step in a long journey, so I hope this makes sense to you.\n\n(edit): thank you all so much for your responses and advice, it's amazing to hear back from people who actually understand.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Stutter","subreddit_id":"t5_2scwr","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Stutter","subreddit_subscribers":7534,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"confidence and belief systems","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stutter\/comments\/ewxo2o\/confidence_and_belief_systems\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I am 16 years old with divorced parents(I live with my dad). I am a member of two large families who are all members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints(Mormons.) The oldest cousin in my dad's family left the house two years ago, and had immediately made it known to our family that she doesn't believe in God and was leaving the church. My older sister left the house last year, and also made it known that she doesn't believe in god either. This kicked both of my families into \"high alert\", both sides not wanting to lose another.I myself started questioning God's existence when I was 11, and stopped believing in him altogether when I was 14. It wasn't worth it at the time to tell my parents because there wasn't really a reason to cause issues. Recently my current trimester in high school has recently made my life very difficult and stressful, and my next trimester is going to be 10x worse. I go to a more advanced high school, which means I get about 12 hours of homework a week when I have easy classes. My next trimester is going to turn those 12 hours a week into 24 hours. My current tri added 4 hours, which isn't that bad, but it helped a lot that I didn't have seminary(religious) this tri. I have seminary again next tri, which is going to hurt me a lot knowing I could be doing homework at school at that moment.I am also now a priest, which gives me a lot of responsibilities that stresses me out during the weekend. I also honestly really don't have any close friends at church, which makes church harder to bear. I also have to deal with family scripture reading, which usually last 15-30 minutes, which is precious time I want to use doing my homework. I usually have to sit through 12-15 hours of church stuff I don't care about a week. Might as well count 24 more hours wasted due to the fact that Sundays are only for resting, which means I am not allowed to do homework on Sundays.Not wasting all this time will really help me next tri, and losing the stress from church duties will help even more.\n\nConcerning my parents, I think my dad is very understanding. I hesitate telling him this because I know my step-mom will most likely affect his decision in a negative way. She is a very entitled parent, and has raised my two younger entitled brothers. She always attacks me and defends my younger brothers, no matter what the situation is. I do know though that if I don't tell them this in an assertive matter, it won't go well for me. My mom is also understanding, but I think it is a 50\/50 chance with her.I am worried if I tell them and request that they stop making me go to church, they won't allow it due to my younger brothers wanting to stay home too. I honestly don't care what my younger brothers think, but my parents can't learn how to say no to them. I'm also worried about telling them this because I was barely able to convince them to stop making me go to young men's\/women's activities(which I hate with a burning passion.) My mom doesn't even know I don't attend them anymore.\n\nI am wondering if I should just try and suck it up and wait until I leave for college(seems unhealthy to bottle it up) or if I should take the chance? I am open to any other suggestions.The only suggestion I don't want to hear is to try and believe in the religion again. What do you think I was doing when I was 11-14 when I started doubting in the existence of God? I didn't get a single answer or clue for 3 years. He had his chance.\n\nThank you for whoever took the time to read this. Feel free to ask any clarifying questions, I really need some advice.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjdm","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Advice","subreddit_subscribers":400975,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I don't believe in God, but how do I tell my parents?","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/ewxoy0\/i_dont_believe_in_god_but_how_do_i_tell_my_parents\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I'm not a regular user of this subreddit, but I thought I had to share my life progression and how porn has seriously affected it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   I'll start off by saying that I don't use a lot of porn in excess. I'll also start off by saying that Im not going to bullshit any of you, because I know this is a seriously stressful and depressing topic for many of you, myself included. When I was \"binging\", I wouldn't watch porn for more than ten minutes and only watched once a day (every day, mind you). I feel like porn has had a major impact on how I perceive the world, and want to see if this is relatable or just totally nonsensical and over analytic. \n\n  I started watching porn around fourteen years old. When I first found it, I immediately knew that it was wrong. I knew that it was wrong to do, because I could feel the innocence of my childhood and young teenage life leaving my body, if that makes sense. I thought of porn as an escape- I had recently broken up with my girlfriend of six months, and I regretted it. I really liked her, and I never had the chance to tell her that after we broke up, because it seemed like she moved on and it would be too late. So, as a result, like many drug addicts do, I found my drug to cope with the stress of my life. I missed her so much, but I couldn't get her back, and I didn't want anyone else. Mind you, I was a young teen at the time, and she was my first love, so I didn't feel like trying to find another girl, if that makes sense. I felt super lost, and when I get lost I tend to look for a quick fix. Porn satisfies this \"quick fix\" craving. You watch it, it turns you on, you can look for literally any scenario you want, and you'll find it. \n\nI started watching porn everyday, and it was really just a habit until about a year ago (I'm 19 now). It literally feels like the past couple years are a blur, because the guilt that I carried from watching porn for five years, pretty much daily, ate me up alive. But like many other dopamine releasing agents, porn is a drug. And I was addicted. You know the urge that comes over you, it's like the analogy of the devil and angel on your shoulder. My conscience was pleading with me to heal, but my need for the stimuli of porn was too strong and overcame my higher self every single time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI became something else. I truly believe in good and evil forces in this world, but not in a hypothetical kind of way. I believe that it affects us each day, and eats away at our conscience (knowledge of morality). Every time you drink alcohol, inject heroin, gamble your life savings, or watch porn, I believe that we truly know that it is wrong, and half of us tries to make us realize this and quit it, but the other half of us commands that we continue to consume - because its easier. \n\nI've come to the realization that the good things in life do not come easy, and some things seem so hard to attain until you write them down and focus on achieving what you think seems impossible at the time. Quitting porn is not going to come easy, because it's too strong of a drug. But like anything in this entire world, you can change. You can come to terms with yourself that porn is too destructive to continue living your only life on this God given Earth consuming it. I truly believe that porn is the manifestation of evil in this world. Just like the videos on gore sites where you can watch people get hit by trucks, get beheaded, etc. Evil is a temptation, and separates you from your higher self. You quite literally become a monster - because what is a monster? When I think of a monster, I think of the definition of it and the motives behind a stereotypical monster. The definition of a monster is an imaginary thing that is large, ugly, and frightening. Now, what are the motives of a monster? Personally, I believe that if you were to encounter a monster, that it does not care about you. It only cares about itself and it only seeks to attain its selfish desires. This is why monsters in movies such as Scream, Jason, and Chucky all seem so freightening. Because you know that there is no common ground or negotiation with these monsters. It's either you run far, far away from it, or it gets you. Because of this, we are quite literally victims of the monster also known as pornography. \n\nSo this is my proposition to you all. Every time that I have an urge to watch porn, I will stop everything that I'm doing and close my eyes. I will connect with my brain and my conscience, and I will ask the question, \n\n\"Is porn my friend or a monster that is trying to get me and everything that I have?\"\n\nRelationships are ruined by porn, divorces happen, and your psychology literally changes when you consume a lot of it. I believe that this is too great a sacrifice for something that only gives you a couple seconds of euphoria. I think it is much more manly and strong to deny this monster every single time we see it. Stare it in the face, and say fuck you. You've taken too much from me for me to succumb to your temptations anymore. I've changed. I have heart, I have a drive, and I have goals.  \n\n\\*sidenote: The whole time that I've been watching porn, I found it hard to formulate goals and try to better myself. Now, after not watching it for just a short week, I have literally written down my goals on paper, and I strive to attain these goals each day, no matter how hard. \n\nIt's a mindset, you see. It's a mindset that stems from feeling betrayed and lied to. And I don't think I'm the only one who feels lied to by the porn industry, and anything that promotes its use. Our friends who say its normal, the advertisements online promoting it, and everything in between. The devil has fucked with my mind for too long, and I'm honestly done watching porn because I truly believe that I have logically figured out how porn works and the effect it has on my mind, soul, and conscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike I said, this is a journey. It's not easy, but I've finally made the declaration that porn is evil and eats away at my psyche. This is not something that I wish to have to put up with for the rest of my life, so that is why I am quitting porn for good. If y'all want, I'll post updates and how my mind continues to evolve after quitting porn. I hope that you guys can find it within yourselves to deny this drug, because the amount of time that I've known porn to be wrong but never acted on it is way too fucking long. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sincerely appreciate anyone who has read this entire novel (lol), and I wish you all the best on your life's journey and I have faith that we all can eradicate this nasty demon from our lives, and live a more fulfilling and respectable life for ourselves - so that we can truly respect ourselves and be proud of who we are.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"NoFap","subreddit_id":"t5_2skrn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/NoFap","subreddit_subscribers":586514,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"How porn affected my adolescence and how nofap has helped","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/NoFap\/comments\/ewxr5g\/how_porn_affected_my_adolescence_and_how_nofap\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

My partner and I have been dating for just under a year now (February 3rd is our anniversary)and I am 36 weeks pregnant. This is his first serious relationship. I have always thought my sex drive was very average. Even when my partner and I had sex that day (usually multiple times a day), he would masturbate multiple times a day as well.I have been battling depression for most of my adult life and I've been on antidepressants before but never long-term. I went on them previously after I had my first daughter (from a previous relationship) for postpartum depression and I remained on them for only a few months. This time around I noticed it was getting increasingly difficult to function starting about midway through this pregnancy and I made an appointment with my doctor and requested to be put back on antidepressants. She obliged and I started on a very low dose of Zoloft, which I had previously taken and it worked well for me. Unfortunately, it has destroyed any and all desire to be intimate but I was well aware of this particular side effect. In combination with being exhausted and uncomfortable being extremely pregnant, our sex life has virtually disappeared. My partner asks continuously, at least once a day to have sex and I try to explain that I really don't feel like it. This has been going on for several weeks and at first he would sigh and just say \"Okay\" but lately he's been  increasingly agitated when I say no. He'll claim that \"he's tired of hearing excuses\" and he'll rant for several minutes and this usually ends in him giving me the cold shoulder. On my birthday (1\/26), we spent the whole day out of the house and didn't get home until late and by then, I just wanted to go to bed but he asked to have sex and I said not tonight. He responded by slamming the door and immediately leaving to go buy some beer. I kind of brushed it off because I am well used to his  temper tantrums by now but after he came back and finished off the beer he bought, I had assumed that I was done hearing from him for the night and had already prepared for bed but he instead asked \"So, we're really not going to have sex tonight?!\" I didn't know what to say and laid back down. He snatched his pillows and slept on the couch and he's been sleeping on the couch for nearly a week now. In addition to not sleeping in our bed, he won't have any sort of conversation with me, hold my hand, hug me goodbye when he leaves for work, and is generally being very cold and rude. He is refusing to have a relationship with me because I cannot be intimate. I've asked him why he's being childish and when will this stop and he implied he'll treat me like a human being again when I give him what he wants.

Funny thing is, I was in a really sexual relationship with an ex girlfriend and she showed it to me and said something to the effect of 'if you ever want to feel better about yourself, read deadbedrooms!' and I was hooked. \n\nFast forward to 2017. Meet this attractive girl and we hit it off. Lots of red flags in terms of her past but I figure the past is the past. We start the relationship off by having sex once a day when we we met up. We move in together in 7 months and suddenly the sex stops. It goes to twice a week. She puts on 30 pounds over the next 12 months and the sex gets less and less. Meanwhile I'm in the best shape of my life. Getting hit on a lot but never cheated on her. Still found her attractive. The excused pile up. I'm too tired. I don't feel sexy. \n\nI pay for her course to get her a new career. Do more housework even though I have a job that leaves me mentally drained at the end of the day. She's smiling pot daily. Drinking more than she should and taking anti depressants. I try to have an adult convo with her and she promises to try but a week later things are back to status quo. Sex now gets boring and monotonous. Never wears anything sexy. Infact now she's going around wearing 4 layers even when it's warm. Our life apart from the bedroom isn't good either. Lots of gas lighting and anger issues. Constantly walking on egg shells.waking up an hour earlier so I can masturbate and not have to be turned down. She tells me blowjobs are boring and work. Never wants to have morning sex because she loves her sleep. Can't wake her up ever to have sex or she screams at me \n\nFinally takes a lot of drama to get me go quit on the relationship. \n\nAfter a month I meet a gorgeous woman. I'm 39 and she's 41. Incredible body. Has a super high libido. Kinky and sexy. Insists on wearing lingerie. Loves going down on me and pleasing me. I had some trauma from the last relationship but now I'm able to initiate and she initiates half the time. We have crazy sex twice a day and she wants more. Morning sex. Sex in cars. Awesome outside the bedroom. Stable. Loving. Caring. \n\nI want to tell everyone here that if you're miserable, get the fuck out!!!! Find someone more compatible and tour life will change. I'm in even better shape now because I want to look even better for her and sex is great cardio!\n\nHope lives!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DeadBedrooms","subreddit_id":"t5_2t25p","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/DeadBedrooms","subreddit_subscribers":242435,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"What a change","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DeadBedrooms\/comments\/ewxyy4\/what_a_change\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

This is my first ever post on this subreddit and I am so sorry I flair this post incorrectly. I have been looking at FDS for just three months now and you all have helped me out so much. This post will be long so please bear with me, TLDR at the bottom though. \n\nSo, I am 29 years old. When I was 24 I met my first serious boyfriend , who was 27 at the time. I was so naive back then and a total pickmeisha so a good looking guy paying attention to me was exciting and so I was hanging out with him and giving him rides everywhere since he didn't have a car because of a DIU he got years before. I asked him out and he said no because \"I'm not faithful\" I said ok, and we continued hanging out, and the more I helped him out the more he wanted to hang out and a few weeks later he asked me out, but we never really went on dates since he was basically broke. \n\nWe were together for almost three years which consisted of me driving us around and paying for a lot of dates and his food since he mostly ate fast food. He was just awful and hardly comforted me, he would not pay attention to a lot of stuff I was interested in, deeming them nerdy or too weird for his tastes. I used to let him borrow my car often even though he still drank quite a bit, which was very, very stupid of me I know. He would expect me to drop everything to help him out but if I needed help, too bad I was on my own. \n\nA few months before breaking up he managed to get a better job, and he was always changing jobs, and his dad gave him a car, so he had his own transportation and he managed to get a few \"friends\" at his workplace (before he only had two friends who he would sometimes hang out with) and he started ignoring me more, and would get mad if I told him he was ignoring me telling me that he didn't to explain anything to me. He then broke up with me because he said my depression was too much for him to handle. I was devastated for months after while he was happy hanging out with friends, but after 6 months I started getting over him. Lo and behold, he started texting me that he missed me and stupid me actually replied and we started hanging out again and he told me that his \"friends\" stopped talking to him and then a month after that conversation he lost his job. This is when he started wanting me back. \n\nThese past three years I kept saying no to him wanting to get back together, he moved away to be with his son, and today I get a message telling me that he is moving back here since he can't pay rent, he lost his car and due to another DIU he got a few months ago. Me on the other hand, have been on medication for depression for almost two years and I feel way better, tomorrow marks the one year I moved into my own house, where I live with my mom and brothers and I have my own brand new car. I am totally happy being single and just having my fun hobbies and hanging out with my friends and loving my life. Thank god, I dodged a bullet or as my best friend says \"a whole fucking nuclear bomb\" This sub has helped me see just how awful he was and continues to be which is making me cut off contact with him. Thank you, ladies!\n\nTLDR: My ex treated me like trash, was only with me because he needed someone to leech off from, he  started earning more and got a car so he dumped me only to come crawling back months later when things started going south for him. No he might be homeless since his dad can't help him out anymore. I am loving my life though.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"FemaleDatingStrategy","subreddit_id":"t5_xaiot","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/FemaleDatingStrategy","subreddit_subscribers":66483,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Ex boyfriend keeps making his own life worse, my life keeps getting better.","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FemaleDatingStrategy\/comments\/ewxzsf\/ex_boyfriend_keeps_making_his_own_life_worse_my\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

But I'm so fucking lost. I got no experience with sex, love, feelings, etc. and I'm still working on my confidence. I dated a couple of less attractive guys (This sounds super arrogant but I dunno how else to say it, just mean guys who are much older and quite out of shape) just to get some experience in. Just soft sex.

I was just getting into the shower and thought it was a great opportunity to send him a little something extra. \n\nI took a few pics in the shower, nude obviously, and sent them to him. His first reply was \u201cOMG nice\u201d and then he sends \u201cBut that isn\u2019t what I was meaning\u201d. This extra comment kind of upset me. He didn\u2019t specify what type of pic he wanted. I made the choice to send nudes and that\u2019s what he got and they were nice, very nice. \n\nI asked him why he had to throw in the extra comment about not being what \u201che meant\u201d because I couldn\u2019t understand why he needed to say that. That if he wanted something specific then he needed to tell me or provide some kind of disclaimer like \u201cSend a pic (but your face, no nudes please)\u201d or something like that. \n\nHe thought that was ridiculous and that I was completely blowing things out of proportion. I just wanted him to know that extra comment wasn\u2019t appreciated and that it made me feel a bit ashamed of sending him what I did. He then proceeds to defend himself saying I was taking it the wrong way and that I was being a huge asshole about the whole thing. I told him I felt he was the asshole, not me. I finally told him I took his text in the wrong way and apologized, but I\u2019m still bothered by it. \n\nI will add that he\u2019s a business owner and works alone, so NSFW doesn\u2019t apply to our texts while he\u2019s working. \n\nAm I the asshole here? I\u2019m at a loss.\n\nEDIT- I am 30 and he\u2019s 41 if that makes a difference.

A little bit of background: I am 21 and have a border collie\/Australian Shepherd mix who is almost 5. I currently live with my mom while paying off student loans. I will admit I haven\u2019t spent as much time on training my dog as I should have, which is my bad and my fault.\n\nNow that I do have a full time job and can afford it, I\u2019d like to take her to a dog trainer to help me build a foundation with her and get rid of bad habits. However, my mom and I majorly disagree on what \u201ctraining\u201d entails and how to go about it. She\u2019s very soft-hearted when it comes to my dog and treats her like a toddler. This has caused a lot of bad habits to form. My dog is not crate trained and has no manners because my mom fears it\u2019s \u201ctoo mean\u201d. My mom feeds her more human food that I would like, and sometimes even feeds my dog food at the table off of a fork. There\u2019s no reprimanding for bad behavior because my mom thinks it\u2019s mean, but there is also very little rewarding of good behavior. I\u2019ve researched a lot about dog training and what approaches to take, and it seems like my mom has a reason why that won\u2019t work or why it is \u201cwrong\u201d for every one of them. \n\nMy question is, how can I train my dog when others in the house will not participate in and will probably undo all of the training? I\u2019ve talked to local dog trainers about it and they\u2019ve said that typically dogs only listen to one person in the house mainly anyway, but I want to make sure the training sticks in any situation, not just when I am around, and I\u2019m afraid that won\u2019t happen when my mom doesn\u2019t treat my dog like a dog and doesn\u2019t follow training procedure. \n\nI hope someone has some advice because this situation is becoming more problematic and I\u2019m not sure how to go about it!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Dogtraining","subreddit_id":"t5_2r067","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Dogtraining","subreddit_subscribers":184881,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Need advice with training when my mom doesn\u2019t want to upkeep the skills learned","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Dogtraining\/comments\/ewys8x\/need_advice_with_training_when_my_mom_doesnt_want\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I have been in the lifestyle for roughly ten years      but in  the last few years I have been lacking a true submissive to      further  nurture and explore this side of me. I am very discreet, and      keep this  side of me private. Most people would have no idea that   this    side of me  exists, and I'd like to keep it that way for the   most  part.   I'm 5'8,  150, and in general take care of myself so I'm   looking  for  the  same in  you. Here's a breakdown of what I'm looking   for  roughly:\n\n**You**\n\nSubmissive,  intelligent, open minded in all things, want to grow with someone   and     have them help nurture and guide you, want a true connection and    open   to  something long term, is able to hang out in person   regularly,   eager  to  please, motivated to make this into something   real, willing   to work   towards this common goal we have together. I'd   like someone   who cares   about their appearance and will put forth  an  effort to be   the submissive   that I think about all day every  day.  Someone who   strives to be on my   mind always. I really don't  have a  \"type\" of woman  other than an average\/ fit\/ thin submissive,  but I will  admit alt or  goth girls do make me look twice at them.\n\n**Me**\n\nDominant,  know what I want and what I am looking for. Want to mentor you but      also  want to enjoy the fact that my submissive pushes me to be the    best   man  that I can in all things. This really motivates me and will    be   vitally  important. I'm currently working to further my education    to better  provide for  myself and my submissive. I want my future      submissive to be the  center of my world, my love and my everything. I    am a romantic, well traveled (lived in three different countries, and      all over the US), extremely devoted to what's mine and care for    what I   have deeply and  unconditionally. I keep my circle small, and      intimate and that's the way  that I prefer it.\n\nI    am more of a museum and   coffee kind of person  rather than going  out   to clubs or anything like  that.  Also I do not drink, or use any   drugs  so  please  keep that in mind. I don't mind if you do, as long  as  it's  all done responsibly. When it comes to the bedroom I have a  lot  of  stamina, and really would like someone who can keep up.  Insatiable   pretty much. Well endowed, and have been told I'm very  attractive. I   have more of a skater\/ punk style. A few tattoos and  looking to get   more, and my ears are stretched a bit. Love punk,  indie, any kind of   metal, acoustic, edm, and pop punk. Really I can  listen to anything   though, just not a big fan of country music.\n\nI  have been in a FFM poly sub\/ dom relationship before. It was a very  enriching and interesting experience. So if you are a bi female, and interested in a submissive FFM poly relationship then I'd like to hear  from you.\n\nIf  you are a   submissive, and more interested in a hookup\/ getting to  business ASAP   then I am interested in that as well. I am good with  boundaries, and   respect them. Open to many kinks, and have few hard  limits for myself.   So girls, if you are interested in trying something  different\/ kinky\/   taboo with someone experienced don't be shy.\n\nHope    to hear from you soon! But please be willing to verify relatively  quickly, I'm getting some responses from people who don't seem to want    to verify and it's just wasting everyone's time.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtyr4r","subreddit_id":"t5_2vqun","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dirtyr4r","subreddit_subscribers":341203,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"31 [M4F] # Fort Worth Dominant guy looking for a submissive","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtyr4r\/comments\/ewyu9y\/31_m4f_fort_worth_dominant_guy_looking_for_a\/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}

I had blood work done recently for all sleeping related things that could cause me to be tired throughout the day. I\u2019m tired of having to nap one to four hours a day after school to not feel extremely tired anymore. I already get 8-10 hours of sleep per night and I fall asleep relatively easy, I have perfect blood pressure as well. I\u2019ve tried staying awake to see if I was getting too much sleep, but the problems only get worse if do that.  My parents are saying that I am a teen and I am still developing and so I need all that extra sleep, but I am 17. Now I know you all aren\u2019t doctors, but I would appreciate some insight on what it may be. I do plan to go back up to the doctors again.\nCurrent symptoms:\n\nI don\u2019t feel tired in the morning, but it grows throughout the day making it unbelieveably hard to focus, it gets relatively bad after I hit 11:00 AM\n\nPeople say that I breath pretty hard at random times, I am pretty athletic, never smoked and I played travel soccer all my life. I never notice when I breath hard.\n\nI slur words all the time, and I for some reason never notice that I slur words because it sounds like to me I am not slurring worfs, although speaking feels like a pain at times. \n\nNapping 1-4 hours a day, I have tried using caffeine to keep me away, to no avail it didn\u2019t work, and fyi I rarely drink anything with caffeine anymore, I use to drink 1-2 cans of soda a day when I was around age 13 and below.\n\nMy memory seems to be worse then most average people. I use to learn so easily before puberty.\n\nI had so much energy before puberty, my memory was perfect, and I never really was tired.
