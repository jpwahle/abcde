All of us are extremely dedicated to this project and have been working together for over a year. That being said, we are extremely laid back and understanding. It is perfectly okay if you can only commit a few hours a week as long as you do not over promise and under deliver. We all have jobs and/or school and a life outside of ITT.\n\nTalent Needed\nWe are currently seeking a 2D character artist/designer capable of matching our games art style (screenshots will be posted here) as well as a UI designer.

I am 26 years-old, passionate about video games, and also am a young entrepreneur. I recently got out of the military and moved to San Diego, CA from Ohio in order to be closer to the industry. I took a few classes in Video game Design from Coleman University and before I start my own studio I want to have one release under my belt to gain funding and a good reputation.\n\n\nIsland Troll Tribes was originally created in Warcraft 3 by ToxicNinja, Moot, and a few others. It  is a team-based strategy game that is a mix between a traditional MOBA and a survival game. The ultimate goal in Island Troll Tribes is to work with your team to survive and eliminate the enemy team.\nAt the beginning of every match you will have to select one character from a list of many. Each character has their own unique strengths and weaknesses such as varying inventory space that is used to hold items. Players will have to go around the map collecting items and gathering food in order to build buildings that will allow you to make armor, weapons, potions, and better food.\n\n\nGame play mechanics are similar to other MOBAs, however, the map is a wilderness setting and is not built with \"lanes\". Also, ITT will have survival elements such as hunger, heat, and energy. If any of these hit zero, you die. In order to survive the harsh elements, all players within your team must work together to hunt animals for food as well as build various buildings from objects scavenged from the environment.","stickied":false,"permalink":"/r/INAT/comments/4csu0v/structured_team_looking_for_artists_or_coders/","num_comments":4,"id":"4csu0v","distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"created_utc":1459468852,"media_embed":{},"locked":false,"from":null,"is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"media":null,"subreddit":"INAT","hide_score":false,"secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":1463481924,"subreddit_id":"t5_2ui2u","author":"Zebrakiller","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"retrieved_on":1463511566,"link_flair_css_class":null,"from_id":null,"title":"structured team looking for artists or coders","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/INAT/comments/4csu0v/structured_team_looking_for_artists_or_coders/","archived":false,"domain":"self.INAT","author_flair_text":null,"ups":0,"score":0,"link_flair_text":null}

I didn't consider sales for my career at all until I started there. Within 6 months I got promoted to Mobile (cell phones) department sales team lead. Before that my goal was to be the best. So I was. Every month I was ranked in the top 5 in the district (950 sales associates) for productivity. This was a driving force to my success and promotions within the store.

So, I think I want to make sales my career. Although, I have a few concerns about it.  I honestly don't think my sales experience so far (been with BBY for nearly 1 year) will translate that well to other sales jobs. I haven't done any cold calling and I'm slightly intimidated by that.

I explain in greater detail below!\n\nI've seen versions of this question come up on this sub daily, but even after reading the FAQ I'm incredibly conflicted. I've been going back and forth about this for nearly a year of repayment now.  I have made pro/con lists for every option and I still can't settle on a proper decision.  Here's the skinny:\n\nIncome with three jobs: ~1450 a month.\n\nStudent loans: 600 a month.\n\n\nRent: 695.  \n\nUtilities:~75 a month.\n\nGroceries:~20 a month.\n\nEntertainment:~15 a month.\n\n\n\nNow before you respond, I know how bonkers this set up is. **BUT WAIT!** I've been living on this hyper strict budget for over a year and I'm actually doing alright!  I find my work very satisfying, I've learned how to make food last /I've improved my cooking skills, two of the jobs are from home so I don't feel terribly strained by running all over town, and I don't pay for transportation because I am bike exclusive.  I don't drink and only eat out maybe twice a month so my spending is incredibly limited. \n\n I have about 20 dollars left over a month on average, I have around 5000 in emergency savings/tax money for my freelance positions, and I'm actually paying a little extra on the loans to whittle them down (I technically only owe 550 a month).  I am also working towards a pension with my primary job (which is also in my field!) so I'm not just breaking even.  \n\n\nBut then again, every once in a while the terrible weight of my debt just hits me... and it hits hard.  One of the first things that this sub recommends is switching to an income based repayment and yes, I understand that it would lessen the stress.  However, I truly do not want to stop paying this amount as long as I am at all able to.  \n\nIncome based is great in theory, but I have high interest loans so the idea of slowly undoing that little dent I've made makes me feel terrible.  And even if my loans are forgiven in ten years, they're still tax liable which will hurt down the road.  Plus, I'll constantly have them floating behind every decision I make for the next ten years. Vacation? Nope, too guilty that I still have loans.  Week off from work?  Whelp, with all those loans I have it just feels irresponsible!  I guess switching to a lower payment (when I'm managing) just feels like giving up.  \n\nI admit to being a little obsessed with my loans/money.  I check my bank accounts multiple times a day and my loan balances twice a week and I'm constantly doing math in my head to see if things fit into my budget.  I'm not unhappy though!  I'm a very active and upbeat person all around and I even occasionally find the repayment process satisfying. \n\nBasically I'd just like some input from people who have been here.  Or people who understand the income based options at a deeper level than I do. I just don't like the idea of making it easier on myself now just to have a hard time in 5 or ten years, but this may be a na\u00efve way of thinking about it.  I am 24 and I've only been out of school for about 2 years, but I really do not want this debt to follow me into my thirties (which I imagine it will if I switch to income based).   \n\n\nYet on the other hand I frequently discover that I've been sitting and staring at my bank accounts with a calculator out for 45 minutes and genuinely wonder if my way is really healthy...  \n\n\nI should clarify that I don't intend to stick with this job set-up for eternity of course, but it's incredibly convenient right now because I chose a low rent area with great bike access.  Plus, I need experience to get ahead in my field and that's what I'm working on.

Then this guy joined our class, and he's constantly making sexist remarks. We had a big joke after a comment made by the welding inspector, \"The beads don't have to be as pretty as you\", to me, (I found it hilarious, not offended at all) and we were joking about it in class, and sexist guy goes \"Must be nice, have a set of tits and get your welding ticket\". I ranted about that for a bit earlier on. He's new, I've been there since September. We have \"juniors\" and \"seniors\". I'm a senior. I've got 2 CWB tickets (Mig and Stick flat, groove-fillet)\n\nSo today.. we were at CWB, and I was doing vertical stick on the virtual reality welding machine, which is super cool (if you're a welder). It grades you. I got 89%, highest of anyone, without using the mask - its too big.\n\nHe goes \"Someone needs to put her in her place. Too bad this place doesn't have a kitchen!\" and everyone, including our tour guide, heard it. I said, \"I don't cook food. I cook metal\" and our instructor was pissed that that guy basically made him look bad in front of a colleague. He's constantly making jerk remarks to me, and the other woman in the class (who is a junior, but is coming along well). \n\nThe rest of the guys, well, they treat me like one of them. A lot of ribbing, some sexist stuff, but it's in jest. Our instructor's heard several of the comments, and he's told him off a few times, but this guy is an asshole. (He told one of the seniors, really nice guy, to fuck off, when he gave him advice while the juniors ran beads on scrap, to get used to Stick)\n\nIt's hard for me to let go of shit like that. You can pretty much make fun of me for everything, but this guy is really, really, getting on my nerves. It's not in jest, he's being an asshole. I don't know really how to handle it, and I know when I work in the field there are gonna be people like that.\n\nSo what do I do about this guy, and the comments?\n\nAnd for the record, I got the highest stick flat and stick vertical marks on the virtual reality machine. Our instructor did one vertical, got 1% more than me, but I'd rather he beats me than does worse, he's my mentor/teacher!\n\nHe's seriously told this guy off over and over.. I don't want to go above my teacher, the guy is 49, I'm 31, I know I'm a better welder than him, but I wanna throttle him.\n\nI just needed to get this out. I was having a blast, then he makes some stupid fucking remark, makes an ass out of my instructor and I. I can handle ribbing, people playing (harmless) pranks, but this just eats at me, because its personal. And to fucking say that somewhere we're touring.. not a good idea. He's 18 years older than I, I'm 31, and a few people think he's threatened by me.\n\nSorry for the long whine.

I never knew this sub existed, but I found it today after searching for a forum to explain what happened today. My thoughts are all over the place, so I apologize in advance if this is poorly written.\n\nFirst, some background info on me and my sister. I'm 22 and she is 23. We get along extremely well. We've never done anything sexual up until now, but we tend to roughhouse a lot and give each other playful smacks on the rear, but today, that all changed. \n\nIt happened today. I'm a huge gamer and she is a casual. I saw a trailer for a game called King of Fighters 14 today and a favorite character of mine was revealed. Without going too deep into the game itself, I'll give some info that's important to my story. For those of you who aren't familiar with the game, there's a character named Geese who has a move where he counters an opponent's attack while saying \"predictable\" (in engrish). \n\nThe reveal of this character got me really excited, and my sis was in the room while I watched the trailer, and me, getting carried away, imitated the character's fighting stance and approached my sister ready to roughhouse. After a few minutes of playing, I started to imitate the character's counter move and slammed my sister on the bed several times while saying \"predictable\". Everything started out normal, but for some reason I slammed her on the bed again after another counter and this time I pulled her panties(she was wearing a skirt) down and smacked her on the ass without thinking. She giggled and called me perv and continued to attack me. This time I took things further and slammed her again and while she was laying on her stomach, I started licking her ass. She moaned and did not object to it. \n\nIt lasted for maybe five minutes. After we were done everything went back to normal. We didn't mention it and we talked like we usually do, but I'm not sure how I feel about it.

His name alone, 'Roger Cicero', screams blissful superficiality. I hate everything about him. I couldn't contain my seething rage and called him a cancer on the body politic, a vile immature creature, etc. Fact is, it's starting to affect my life.

I always make it to work somehow (7:30am), but if I have a class that I have to wake up for (even if it's at noon), I have the tendency to skip it or be late, like a lot. I skip appointments and everything else if I have to wake up before my body wants to.\n\n\n\nAs a child, my mom worked at my school and I constantly made her late for work because I just refused to get out of bed. My alarm clock is the devil summoning me to hell, basically.\n\n\n\nThis has been fine in the past because those classes were very easy for me and I made an A+ regardless. This next quarter, they won't be. I'm legitimately worried about making it to my noon class. Which is sad.\n\n\n\nI hate sleeping the day away, but I can't bring myself to get up. If I set an alarm, I will literally snooze over and over for hours. I've planned to wake up and take my meds, then go back to sleep and try and get up 30 min later, but I haven't even been able to get myself to do that. For some reason I worry it's going to make me not feel good and I might just sleep through the Adderall anyways- or not be hungry enough for breakfast and be food deprived.\n\n\n\nDo I just completely lack self discipline or what?

Any tips on how to bring myself to do that? This is a serious problem for me.\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the feedback and app recommendations. Many have asked this- my body wants to sleep 10+ hours. Usually 12, actually. I've struggled with insomnia my whole life, and based on my schedule it is just not possible to go to bed and to sleep every day at the same time. On days that I work, I usually get about 6 hours (only a few days per week). I know the insomnia wouldn't be as bad if my sleep schedule was better. I'm prescribed sleeping meds, and I use melatonin and/or diphenhydramine to sleep as well. Regardless of if I take something to sleep or not, my body still wants to sleep for 10+ hours.

It's still on my mind a fair bit, and I want some outside opinions, but really our only issue was that she didn't feel like I was giving her enough attention, enough time, and that she wasn't a priority for me. As some background info, we always lived with our families, she went straight from undergrad to grad school, and I, after job hopping and feeling unfulfilled, went back for my Master's as well.\n\nThat was really our constant argument, she wanted to be inseparable, while I was more comfortable at seeing each other 3-5 days a week. I don't mean this in a mean way, I absolutely loved her completely, and adored her personality and looks (honestly a 10/10 petite girl) and demeanor, but I think when you go from a few days a week to seeing each other every day, or all the time...you have to start integrating the \"regular parts\" of your life together too. I always said I'd love to see her every day...if she'd let me. I mean, the shocking thing I learned while working is that during the week, your free time is essentially from about 6 when you get home from work to about 11 when you go to bed.\n\nLike for example, let's say I wanted to learn to change the oil on my car. I think that's a pretty attractive skill in a man. I'd suggest bringing it to her house, and doing it outside. Her dad used to be into cars, maybe he could help me, get some bonding time in. Or she could help me, it's all good! But ideas like that were just so \"weird\" to her and \"not what boyfriends and girlfriends are supposed to do\". So then I'd say something like \"Well then on a random weekday, I'm going to change my oil when I get home from work while it's still light out. I don't think I'll be able to see you that day\". This of course would cue \"Why is changing your oil more important than me\" or sometimes a good old \"Why do you hate me?\"\n\nThis seems like a small example, but it just happened week in and week out. She never wanted to do homework together, because it was too boring of a thing to do while we had each other. If I wanted to apply for jobs, and suggested bringing my laptop over while she was working on something or other, that was also a really offensive idea. It was like, when we were together, we either had to be on something like a traditional \"date\", getting dinner, minigolfing, going to the mall...or just staring into each others eyes and talking. Like I couldn't take my attention off her for a second. Which is something I'm fine doing 4 or so nights out of the week. But damn...I have things I like to do!\n\nLike let's say I was curious about the presidential debates and wanted to watch them. Can't watch it with her, because she'd get antsy that I'm not giving her my full attention. Let's say I wanted to pick up my acoustic guitar and play a song for the first time in a few weeks. Can't bring it over to her house and play her parent's favorite country songs or whatever, because that's \"weird\". Her family invited me over to watch the Super Bowl with them, and then we had to leave the room because she couldn't stop talking to me. A bunch of little things like that add up, and then to be honest, I don't mind having a day or two to myself to just be me.\n\nI mean, even if I was just having a conversation with her parents for 5-10 minutes about, say, Donald Trump or something, she'd get anxious like a child that I wasn't giving her attention, and start tugging on me, or doing something just to hug me, or get my arm around her, or get me to look at her so she could smile. The idea of doing something silently together, like reading, was unthinkable, even 2 years into the relationship. When we'd say goodbye, she'd get mad if I left \"too quickly\", like we had to hold each other for another half hour after the initial goodbye, as if I couldn't pull myself away from her, while in my head, I actually couldn't wait to be home and have the first hour to myself in the past 48. It's obvious to see why this ended.\n\nBut enough examples. I have to stress that she was an amazing person, or else I wouldn't have been with her that long, but I really want to ask about that need for attentiveness. This seems to be a common undercurrent in society, that men tend to be more like me, while women tend to be more like how she was being, while maybe her and I were more extreme examples. When I mention stories like this to women I know, they usually chuckle and talk about how they used to be like that until they grew up or something like that. Or maybe am I too...introverted? I don't know how to describe it, it's like I wanted my \"recharge\" time to be with her, but she wouldn't let me.\n\nIs this an \"immature\" thing? Is it something that is learned by the media? In my ex gf's case, she was very traditionally \"girly\", I mean that's what I loved about her. Petite, shy, modest, innocent, 2 sisters, only friends with girls, grew up on The Notebook and Taylor Swift, and has probably been planning her wedding since about the age of 12. Something I figured out towards the end also was that she'd never gone a month without being in a relationship since she was 14, and I was the first person she ever dated outside her town, so her \"normal\" was a guy walking over to her house every day, meanwhile I lived a little over half an hour away.\n\nBut I'm just curious about where this need comes from, if there really does tend to be a difference between men and women in this department, and do girls ever \"snap out\" of it? I mean, I think she honestly wants a guy that will be at her door to make her breakfast when she wakes up, drive her to school, wait in the parking lot all day, and drive her home, and never lose eye contact with her at all. To what degree do girls have unrealistic expectations of how much attention they can get in an adult lifestyle?","name":"t3_4ct6b3","permalink":"/r/askwomenadvice/comments/4ct6b3/as_i_look_back_at_my_most_recent_relationship_i/","stickied":false,"id":"4ct6b3","num_comments":9,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1459473803,"gilded":0,"media_embed":{},"locked":false,"from":null}

A lot of this weight will food in my stomach from pretty much always being full, water weight from drinking more and working out, glycogen storage, and most importantly fat, so this was **by no means 21kg of LEAN MUSCLE MASS**. The inch I \"grew\" all happened in the first 4 weeks of doing deadlifts and shrugs because of how much my posture improved, I don't think I actually grew at all.\n\nI've been gyming for about 5 years now, so the before pictures below are about half way through my gym \"career\" and as you can see, the first 2.5 years did absolutely fuck all because I wasn't eating anywhere near enough (1800calories or so) and I wasn't training *consistently* enough. **I made more progress in 1 month of eating lifting and sleeping properly than I did in 2.5 years of not taking it seriously enough**\n\nShit tonne of pictures because everyone likes pictures, so will start off with these, I've tried putting them in groups so it isn't just a big random album.\n\n**[Side-by-side Comparisons](http://imgur.com/a/vp4U6)**\n\n**[Current pics with bad lighting](http://imgur.com/a/rfd3T)**\n\n**[Random vascularity pics](http://imgur.com/a/wDh4A)**\n\n**[Random pictures from random times, mostly over the last 4 months](http://imgur.com/a/2X6KS)**\n\nI tried to make the lighting similar/worse in the side-by-side comparisons so as not to give any illusions, both times and the \"current\" pictures were without a pump, the best/random pics are mainly taking advantage of pumps/lighting. Yeah I know I have backne, it was there in the before shots too, just a puberty thing that's left me with post inflammatory hyperpigmentation that refuses to go away. Second last pic on the \"randoms\" is to show just how bad it actually is, in case anyone is into that kinda shit. Last pic on the \"randoms\" is showing stretch marks.\n\n**Routine** was a PPL split for the entire time, 25 sets on each day, 10 reps in every set for each exercise, I did not incorporate any rest days into my routine, I have probably taken around 35 rest days in the last two and a half years, so definitely not a routine thing, just whenever I have other stuff to do like exams, or if I'm really tired. I wouldn't recommend not taking rest days unless you're in a position where you can sleep 10+ hours a night like I was/am in (student fun times!) If you want exact exercises let me know or google \"6 day PPL\" and there ya go! more info https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4ctast/163lbs_to_211lbs_74kg_to_96kg_63_190cm_25_year/d1lnf6z\n\n**Lifts** I don't know what my lifts were before because I can't remember that far back, so I only know current ones.\n\nDeadlift: 440lbs/200kg (favourite exercise by far)\n\nSquat: 265lbs/120kg (least favourite exercise by far, skipped way too many leg days, no regrets)\n\nBench: 265lbs/120kg \n\n\n**Diet** My goal calorie intake is 5500 a day. This seems like a lot but I'm 6'3 210lbs, I go to the gym for 90mins a day, and do a lot of cycling each day so it isn't more than 500 over my TDEE. I'm not going to post a list of the shit I eat because nobody reads that, if you are actually interested in that then let me know in the comments and I'll do my best. I aim for 120g protein a day (SHOCK! HORROR!) and don't count my carbs or fats. I have a very very small appetite that has not increased at all since I started bulking so I have a **very** high fat diet because it means I have to eat less! I eat a lot of fried eggs, a lot of home fried fries/chips, a lot of bread, chicken thighs, I stick mayo on every food that won't taste horrible with it.\n\n**Supplements** None. No, seriously, nothing. No creatine, no BCAA's, no whey, nothing. I'm lactose intolerant which rules out most whey, and by the time I found out about non-milk protein powders I'd already got my diet sorted and had no need to SUPPLEMENT my diet with more protein. I \"dabbled\" in creatine for about two weeks but I couldn't get into the habit of taking it every day and got irrationally pissed off at myself on days I forgot, so I figured it wasn't worth the guilt when I forgot.\n\n**Backstory** I've been gyming for 5 or so years, I put on about 500g of muscle in the first two year and a half. I wasn't eating anywhere near enough, I wasn't training anywhere near as hard enough, I wasn't training anywhere near consistently enough, and I wasn't sleeping enough. The summer before uni I got a little more serious, I started PPL and started tracking my calories and aiming for 3500, saw some progress. At uni (September 2014) I went crazy with the gyming and eating, swapped out my gaming obsession for gym obsession and never looked back. I'm now the biggest I've ever been but probably also the least happy I've ever been with my body. Hundreds of hours in the gym, researching gym stuff and following bodybuilding has given me a completely fucked perspective on what is \"big\" on average and what isn't. I know according to BMI I'm a fair bit (15 or so lbs) into the \"overweight\" category so there's no way I am skinny anymore, but I don't see it in pictures or in the mirror. I \"know\" i am bigger but I don't feel like I am. Woo body dysmorphia woo! I told myself I'll be happy at 85kg, then I got there and said 90kg, then I got there and said 95kg! Now I've been 95kg+ quite consistently for a few months and I'm shooting for 100kg even though I know I won't be happy if I get to 100kg either. Main thing I've learned from all of this is that very few people get serious about gyming and then actually get to a stage where they're genuinely happy with their body. I'd say I'm much more confident now than I was before going to the gym, but I was definitely \"happier\" body-wise before than I am now. I'm not sure if this is because I was deluded then or because I'm deluded now, or both but.. feelsbadman.\n\n**Tips/things I learned**\n\n* You gotta eat a lot, gym a lot, gym hard and sleep a lot over a long period of time, it's as simple as that. What you eat, your macros, how much protein you're having, what exercises you do in the gym, what routine you do,  what time you go, whether you do cardio or not, whether you do high bar or low bar squat, whether you do sumo or conventional deadlift etc etc etc are all things that contribute about 1% to the total of getting bigger, so it's not worth wasting time and effort on small things like this. Eat a lot. Gym a lot and gym hard. Sleep a lot. Do this consistently for a few months and you will see a difference.\n\n* KISS - Keep it simple stupid. Most people overcomplicate gaining, and then get scared, overwhelmed and put off. It really is as simple as the 4 things I said above + time. Suboptimal diet (while over TDEE), routine and sleeping, while being consistent with it is infinitely better than having the perfect diet and routine, and sleeping loads, but only keeping it up for 2 weeks before giving up. \n\n* Adding to ^ find what works for you, eat what you like as long as you're eating enough, do what routine you enjoy, the consistency is the most important thing, you're more likely to stay consistent if you find it enjoyable\n\n* Don't be scared and shun fat from your diet\n\n* Don't overestimate how much protein you need\n\n* Don't be scared of getting fat, you can burn it off later when you've put on the muscle. I got fat as fuck at one point, but I got bigger too and had no regrets, it was much better than the lifetime of being rail thin I had up to that point. Getting fat and putting on muscle is better than staying skinny as fuck\n\n\n* Take supplements if you can afford them and if they don't distract you from the important things\n\n* Shit is hard, my appetite has not increased at all, I've just got better at stuffing my face and not being a little bitch about it. Don't expect your appetite to increase, just learn how to be consistent with it and eat even though you're not hungry.\n\n* Start now, don't put it off, you'll regret not starting now\n\n* Don't worry about how many calories you've had each day, worry about how many calories you've had in a 3 day window. You can eat less one day and more the next day and it ends up the same as eating the right amount both days. Some days you're more hungry than others, on the days where you're hungry, go crazy, eat more, eat way more than your goal, so then the next day if you're less hungry, you won't feel guilty for not eating enough.\n\n* Take before pictures! EVEN BETTER... Take a before video. Prop your phone up somewhere so it's facing you, start recording, do a truck load of poses, everything you can imagine. Then play the video slowly and take screenshots of the different poses, much easier than self timing pictures.\n\nAny questions please ask, I'm very happy to help.","name":"t3_4ct7tu","id":"4ct7tu","num_comments":12,"permalink":"/r/gainit/comments/4ct7tu/progress_163lbs_to_211lbs_74kg_to_96kg_63_190cm/","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"created_utc":1459474415,"distinguished":null,"from":null,"locked":false,"media_embed":{},"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/4ct7tu/progress_163lbs_to_211lbs_74kg_to_96kg_63_190cm/","title":"[PROGRESS] 163lbs to 211lbs (74kg to 96kg) 6'3\" (190cm) 2.5 year progress 6'3\" (190cm) 20 yr old Male","archived":false,"from_id":null,"ups":34,"author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.gainit","link_flair_text":null,"score":34,"quarantine":false,"author":"ThrowLMD","subreddit_id":"t5_2s9bg","edited":1459510212,"downs":0,"post_hint":"self","link_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1463511745,"secure_media_embed":{}}

So this post is aimed at people who struggle with gaining weight. if you are overweight or someone who can easily put on weight because you have a huge appetite please do not follow the advice in this post.\n\n\nPosting my 2.5 year progress from rail-thin 17 year old that thought he was huge to slightly bigger 20 year old plagued by body dysmorphia!\n\n\n**Start**: 163lbs/75kg 6'2/187cm\n\n**Finish**: 211lbs/96kg 6'3/190cm\n\n\n**I put on 46lbs/21kg** and grew an inch/3cm. A lot of this weight will food in my stomach from pretty much always being full, water weight from drinking more and working out, glycogen storage, and most importantly fat, so this was **by no means 21kg of LEAN MUSCLE MASS**. The inch I \"grew\" all happened in the first 4 weeks of doing deadlifts and shrugs because of how much my posture improved, I don't think I actually grew at all.\n\nI've been gyming for about 5 years now, so the before pictures below are about half way through my gym \"career\" and as you can see, the first 2.5 years did absolutely fuck all because I wasn't eating anywhere near enough (1800calories or so) and I wasn't training *consistently* enough. **I made more progress in 1 month of eating lifting and sleeping properly than I did in 2.5 years of not taking it seriously enough**\n\nShit tonne of pictures because everyone likes pictures, so will start off with these, I've tried putting them in groups so it isn't just a big random album.\n\n**[Side-by-side Comparisons](http://imgur.com/a/vp4U6)**\n\n**[Current pics with bad lighting](http://imgur.com/a/rfd3T)**\n\n**[Random vascularity pics](http://imgur.com/a/wDh4A)**\n\n**[Random pictures from random times, mostly over the last 4 months](http://imgur.com/a/2X6KS)**\n\nI tried to make the lighting similar/worse in the side-by-side comparisons so as not to give any illusions, both times and the \"current\" pictures were without a pump, the best/random pics are mainly taking advantage of pumps/lighting. Yeah I know I have backne, it was there in the before shots too, just a puberty thing that's left me with post inflammatory hyperpigmentation that refuses to go away. Second last pic on the \"randoms\" is to show just how bad it actually is, in case anyone is into that kinda shit. Last pic on the \"randoms\" is showing stretch marks.\n\n**Routine** was a PPL split for the entire time, 25 sets on each day, 10 reps in every set for each exercise, I did not incorporate any rest days into my routine, I have probably taken around 35 rest days in the last two and a half years, so definitely not a routine thing, just whenever I have other stuff to do like exams, or if I'm really tired. I wouldn't recommend not taking rest days unless you're in a position where you can sleep 10+ hours a night like I was/am in (student fun times!) If you want exact exercises let me know or google \"6 day PPL\" and there ya go!\n\n**Lifts** I don't know what my lifts were before because I can't remember that far back, so I only know current ones.\n\nDeadlift: 440lbs/200kg (favourite exercise by far)\n\nSquat: 265lbs/120kg (least favourite exercise by far, skipped way too many leg days, no regrets)\n\nBench: 265lbs/120kg \n\n\n**Diet** My goal calorie intake is 5500 a day. This seems like a lot but I'm 6'3 210lbs, I go to the gym for 90mins a day, and do a lot of cycling each day so it isn't more than 500 over my TDEE. I'm not going to post a list of the shit I eat because nobody reads that, if you are actually interested in that then let me know in the comments and I'll do my best. I aim for 120g protein a day (SHOCK! HORROR!) and don't count my carbs or fats. I have a very very small appetite that has not increased at all since I started bulking so I have a **very** high fat diet because it means I have to eat less! I eat a lot of fried eggs, a lot of home fried fries/chips, a lot of bread, chicken thighs, I stick mayo on every food that won't taste horrible with it.\n\n**Supplements** None. No, seriously, nothing. No creatine, no BCAA's, no whey, nothing. I'm lactose intolerant which rules out most whey, and by the time I found out about non-milk protein powders I'd already got my diet sorted and had no need to SUPPLEMENT my diet with more protein. I \"dabbled\" in creatine for about two weeks but I couldn't get into the habit of taking it every day and got irrationally pissed off at myself on days I forgot, so I figured it wasn't worth the guilt when I forgot.\n\n**Backstory** I've been gyming for 5 or so years, I put on about 500g of muscle in the first two year and a half. I wasn't eating anywhere near enough, I wasn't training anywhere near as hard enough, I wasn't training anywhere near consistently enough, and I wasn't sleeping enough. The summer before uni I got a little more serious, I started PPL and started tracking my calories and aiming for 3500, saw some progress. At uni (September 2014) I went crazy with the gyming and eating, swapped out my gaming obsession for gym obsession and never looked back. I'm now the biggest I've ever been but probably also the least happy I've ever been with my body. Hundreds of hours in the gym, researching gym stuff and following bodybuilding has given me a completely fucked perspective on what is \"big\" on average and what isn't. I know according to BMI I'm a fair bit (15 or so lbs) into the \"overweight\" category so there's no way I am skinny anymore, but I don't see it in pictures or in the mirror. I \"know\" i am bigger but I don't feel like I am. Woo body dysmorphia woo! I told myself I'll be happy at 85kg, then I got there and said 90kg, then I got there and said 95kg! Now I've been 95kg+ quite consistently for a few months and I'm shooting for 100kg even though I know I won't be happy if I get to 100kg either. Main thing I've learned from all of this is that very few people get serious about gyming and then actually get to a stage where they're genuinely happy with their body. I'd say I'm much more confident now than I was before going to the gym, but I was definitely \"happier\" body-wise before than I am now. I'm not sure if this is because I was deluded then or because I'm deluded now, or both but.. feelsbadman.\n\n**Tips/things I learned**\n\n* You gotta eat a lot, gym a lot, gym hard and sleep a lot over a long period of time, it's as simple as that. What you eat, your macros, how much protein you're having, what exercises you do in the gym, what routine you do,  what time you go, whether you do cardio or not, whether you do high bar or low bar squat, whether you do sumo or conventional deadlift etc etc etc are all things that contribute about 1% to the total of getting bigger, so it's not worth wasting time and effort on small things like this. Eat a lot. Gym a lot and gym hard. Sleep a lot. Do this consistently for a few months and you will see a difference.\n\n* KISS - Keep it simple stupid. Most people overcomplicate gaining, and then get scared, overwhelmed and put off. It really is as simple as the 4 things I said above + time. Suboptimal diet (while over TDEE), routine and sleeping, while being consistent with it is infinitely better than having the perfect diet and routine, and sleeping loads, but only keeping it up for 2 weeks before giving up. \n\n* Adding to ^ find what works for you, eat what you like as long as you're eating enough, do what routine you enjoy, the consistency is the most important thing, you're more likely to stay consistent if you find it enjoyable\n\n* Don't be scared and shun fat from your diet\n\n* Don't overestimate how much protein you need\n\n* Don't be scared of getting fat, you can burn it off later when you've put on the muscle. I got fat as fuck at one point, but I got bigger too and had no regrets, it was much better than the lifetime of being rail thin I had up to that point. Getting fat and putting on muscle is better than staying skinny as fuck\n\n\n* Take supplements if you can afford them and if they don't distract you from the important things\n\n* Shit is hard, my appetite has not increased at all, I've just got better at stuffing my face and not being a little bitch about it. Don't expect your appetite to increase, just learn how to be consistent with it and eat even though you're not hungry.\n\n* Start now, don't put it off, you'll regret not starting now\n\n* Don't worry about how many calories you've had each day, worry about how many calories you've had in a 3 day window. You can eat less one day and more the next day and it ends up the same as eating the right amount both days. Some days you're more hungry than others, on the days where you're hungry, go crazy, eat more, eat way more than your goal, so then the next day if you're less hungry, you won't feel guilty for not eating enough.\n\n* Take before pictures! EVEN BETTER... Take a before video. Prop your phone up somewhere so it's facing you, start recording, do a truck load of poses, everything you can imagine. Then play the video slowly and take screenshots of the different poses, much easier than self timing pictures.\n\nAny questions please ask, I'm very happy to help.","name":"t3_4ctast","from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/vUDnZNfOC8dNCzq92VomhA9MrmeOLOw10kekoQOr-ck.jpg?s=911c8ed6e173d0245382b7c0bec338a3","height":1465,"width":1937},"variants":{},"id":"S0VNFqDax6vUu9jUZ2LFkQ0PZ3_wuI8Zm6ogo--YWU8","resolutions":[{"width":108,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/vUDnZNfOC8dNCzq92VomhA9MrmeOLOw10kekoQOr-ck.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=08440d56a77afe44bdb866e622a547f9","height":81},{"width":216,"height":163,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/vUDnZNfOC8dNCzq92VomhA9MrmeOLOw10kekoQOr-ck.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=54b1e19fce0bef765c5fcd5a1fe42a0c"},{"height":242,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/vUDnZNfOC8dNCzq92VomhA9MrmeOLOw10kekoQOr-ck.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=87bbaa9df8c4d316c9c1213cd58629aa","width":320},{"height":484,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/vUDnZNfOC8dNCzq92VomhA9MrmeOLOw10kekoQOr-ck.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=d138e46e69020d4b52dbf964542cfd2d","width":640},{"height":726,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/vUDnZNfOC8dNCzq92VomhA9MrmeOLOw10kekoQOr-ck.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=7c33de87955cdbacf2b048b8a2bc4911","width":960},{"width":1080,"height":816,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/vUDnZNfOC8dNCzq92VomhA9MrmeOLOw10kekoQOr-ck.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=7d16a373add2de3b65d79f86a5ed30cd"}]}]},"hide_score":false,"subreddit":"Fitness","thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"media":null,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"retrieved_on":1463511783,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"post_hint":"self","edited":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhx4","author":"ThrowLMD","quarantine":false,"score":16,"link_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.Fitness","ups":16,"from_id":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4ctast/163lbs_to_211lbs_74kg_to_96kg_63_190cm_25_year/","title":"163lbs to 211lbs (74kg to 96kg) 6'3\" (190cm) 2.5 year progress 6'3\" (190cm) 20 yr old Male (x-posted from /r/gainit)","archived":false}

I'd heard of Ragen before, but didn't really know anything about her. However, I was intrigued by IronFat. I have run on and off since I was 16 (I'm 32 now), have done a half- and a full marathon plus a bunch of smaller races, love to cycle, and had occasionally thought about doing triathlon - but never seriously pursued it because I'm a terrible swimmer. I also was 6ish months postpartum, borderline obese from pregnancy weight gain, and while I took responsibility for that and didn't have any fatlogic, I wasn't motivated to change anything.\n\nSoon after I started reading here, Ragen posted that [\"Anatomy of a Long Run\"](http://i.imgur.com/i33P1zT.jpg) post, and people in the comments said it was basically stolen from SwimBikeMom. I'd never heard of SBM, so I did a quick google, read a bunch of her blog, and then downloaded the Kindle version of her book. I read it in a couple of days, and well before the end, decided I was going to become a triathlete. Never mind that I was 35 lbs overweight (175 at 5'3\"), could barely swim more than a doggy-paddle, and my bike is a heavy steel 1970's Schwinn...\n\nAnyway, I joined the local YWCA, watched some YouTube videos on swim technique, and figured it out. I was slow as shit (still am), but at least able to swim a decent distance with passable form after a few weeks. I started running and biking regularly as well, and read up on brick workouts, what to wear, etc.\n\nI did my first sprint triathlon last September. It was a 1500m open-water swim, a 12-mile bike ride, and a 5K run, and I finished in 2:10:37. I did my second earlier this month; a 300yd pool swim, 9-mile bike ride, and 5K run, which took me 1:23:06. I'm doing an Olympic in May, a half-iron (not branded) in September, and if all goes well, a full IRONMAN in October 2017. I still suck at swimming and I still have the heavy bike (turns out that the median triathlete income is roughly 3x mine...), but I'm doing it.\n\nI've lost 15 lbs (and counting!) through training, MyFitnessPal, and a vegan diet. My average training run pace is down to 11 min/mile, from 12. My swim is slowly improving, and I felt confident enough to recently join a local master's swim team for more specific feedback and training. I'm literally the slowest and fattest person there, but everyone is fantastic and it's a great time. \n\nTriathlon is an amazing sport. I've completely fallen in love with it and get excited to go train every day. It pisses me off that Ragen talks about it like it's some terrible thing to be endured, but at the same time, if she wasn't such a lying narcissistic weirdo, I might never have discovered how awesome it is. So I guess I have to say thanks, to Ragen as well as this sub, for introducing me to it.\n\nThat's all! Just wanted to share. :) Y'all are awesome; keep up the good work."}

{"permalink":"/r/CautiousBB/comments/4ctczf/elijahs_birth_story_at_35_4/","stickied":false,"id":"4ctczf","num_comments":4,"selftext":"OK let me start by saying I have an older daughter who was born 3/22/97. My son was born 3/22/16. So they are exactly 19 years apart. But their births couldn't be more different. \n\nI was 19 with my daughter. Had a full epidural, induced, felt nothing during the whole labor and delivery. They did the most severe episiotomy you could, took 40 stitches to seal it up, vacuumed her out. I hated it, felt like I was just a vessel for the baby, had no control or sensation. I wanted this one to be different. \n\nBut I'm 39 now, dx with gestational diabetes at 22w, mostly diet controlled with a little insulin for fasting numbers. Started swelling and spilling protein in my urine at 33w. I was just below the cut off for pre-eclampsia so they were going to induce at 37w. Baby was measuring 7lbs 8oz by ultrasound at 33w, projected to be 11 lbs at 40w. So I had a lot against me but baby passed all his nst and ultrasounds beautifully. I read the Bradley Method book, Hypnobabies and Hypnobirthing books, hoping this labor would go differently then my daughters. \n\nMidnight on 3/20 I was getting ready for bed and thought I felt a bit of liquid. I went and checked, didn't smell, no color. I put on the depends we'd just gotten that night. In less then 5 minutes I gushed water, went thru 3 depends in 15 minutes. I had some ph strips and checked, sure enough water was broke. But I didn't have any contractions yet. So we slept since I wanted to do a lot of my labor at home. Woke up at 3:30 and still no contractions. Took a shower, bounced on my birthing ball, nothing. Called my doula at 6 am and she said let's go walk Walmart. Went to McDonald's, ate breakfast then walked Walmart in my depends, for 3 hours. I finally started getting contractions 8 -10 minutes apart. \n\nAt about 10:30 we decided to go to the hospital. There they confirmed my water had broke. My ob checked me and my cervix was at 1 and thick so we chose cytotec to get it to thin. One tiny pill inserted vaginally and I lay down for half an hour to let it dissolve. Then I got up to walk the halls. Every half an hour they'd check baby on the monitor and my blood pressure and then let me walk again. My contractions slowly got a little stronger and closer together. But by 5pm I got another cytotec since I was only dilated to a 3 and still thick. Then I walked again. My doulas step counter showed we'd walked 10 miles that day. \n\nBy 9pm I had entered active labor and sat on my birthing ball, leaning against the bed and dozing between contractions. I still couldn't say the contractions were overwhelmingly painful. I could concentrate and breathe thru them no problem. At 10:30pm they checked me again and I was only dilated to a 4. By 11 I started to get the urge to push. The contractions were bad enough I was crying instead of breathing and my doula kept reminding me to breathe. I was in transition and no one realized. She told the nurses I was getting pushy and asked them to check me again, but they didn't, feeling like I had just been checked and probably hadn't progressed much. I was upset, thinking I was hurting my baby by my body pushing too early but I couldn't stop it. I thought I was still a 4. At midnight I couldn't handle it anymore and asked for an epidural. If they'd checked me like we asked and I had been a 6 or more I wouldn't have asked for the epidural, but thinking I was only a 4 was demoralizing. The guy came in and gave me an epidural at 12:30am. It didn't take thankfully! He kept giving me boosters of it and none worked at all. My ob came in then, heard my grunting as I pushed and freaked out. Gowned up, checked me and I was fully dilated and effaced. Baby was at 0 station. The nurses are running around getting the warmer ready and everything. They get my legs up slightly and tell me im going to have to push the baby down since he's still high up. I start pushing just after 1am. I get to feel it all and I loved it! \n\nOn tv, once you push out the head, your done, the baby slides out. Not mine! Birth his head and his chest were 13 cm. So I pushed out his head, thought I was done. Nope, push out the shoulders. Thought I was done. Nope, push out the other shoulder. Then I'm done. He was born at 1:19 am. He's got some blood spots on his eyes that are from the force of me pushing him from 0 station to out in less than 15 minutes. My ob pulled my perineum down and out, so even after all the horrid scar tissue there from my daughter, I had two tiny, one stitch tears this time. \n\nBaby boy weighed 7lbs 9oz, so the ultrasound was off. He was 1am/4 inches long. His lungs were mature so no breathing problems. No blood sugar problems. 9 on the apagar scale. My ob delayed cord clamping, let hubby clamp it. Let my placenta come naturally. But when it separated, the sch area I had in early pregnancy didn't clot well and I lost 2 pints of blood after delivery. Due to blood loss I slept for about 4 hours after delivery, passing out at one point. But my daughter used that time to bond with hey little brother, who had stolen not only her birthday, but her heart as well. \n\nBaby boy is doing well. Just some jaundice issues which is common in premies. Altho he's the biggest premie I've ever heard of! My mother in law was in the room too, got to see him be born and got to cuddle him soon after birth along with my daughter and husband. \n\nI loved my labor. I am so thankful to my family, my doula and my ob that they let me labor my way. I'm also so very very happy the epidural failed and I was able to be an active participant in my own labor and was able to feel the baby slow down and out. It was amazing and I love to do it again one more time before I'm too old!","name":"t3_4ctczf","media_embed":{},"locked":false,"from":null,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1459476529,"gilded":0,"subreddit":"CautiousBB","thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"over_18":false,"media":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Green","saved":false,"from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"hide_score":false,"edited":false,"author":"Allindi001","subreddit_id":"t5_30jcb","quarantine":false,"retrieved_on":1463511812,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"author_flair_text":"Green Due 4/21","domain":"self.CautiousBB","ups":5,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"title":"Elijah's birth story at 35 + 4.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CautiousBB/comments/4ctczf/elijahs_birth_story_at_35_4/","score":5,"link_flair_text":null}

Started uni late due to long-term illness (better now). I have a young son with special needs.\n\nSo far I'm half way through a BSc. This semester I'm doing 3/4 units. To put it in some pretty melodramatic terms, it feels like life has become a bottomless pit of darkness. Happiness doesn't feel like a thing anymore. \n\nI don't expect a lot of leisure time, but right now I feel like I have 0 personal time and that I'm overwhelmed/overworked and exhausted. I have to prioritise all of the things that need doing, and \"self-care\" invariably ends up at the bottom of the pile. People say \"you should prioritise it\", but I just don't know where to fit it in without compromising everything else. I feel guilty taking a break when I have a massive pile of work waiting for me, and I feel like doing so will only make my life more difficult when I come back and there's more work added to the list + less time to do it.  I've been having anxiety attacks and crying constantly. Even at this very moment, my chest is tight and painful and my stomach is in knots. \n\nI've considered dropping a subject, but if I do 2 subjects per semester it will take me another 2.5 years to finish and I worry about being so far behind my peers. Also, my partner wants us to move overseas in ~2yrs for his work, so I would be delaying that... I feel like a massive loser for not being able to hold my shit together.\n\nI just don't know what to do. It's killing my love of science and I feel utterly alone and depressed. My partner isn't my son's dad and whilst he is helpful, I still manage the bulk of the care load (as I would expect to), so I often have sleepless nights and run around a lot trying to keep up with his care needs. Between parenting, studying and other responsibilities, I feel like I've lost my identity. We moved an hour away from my support network to be closer to my partner's work, so that's added to the sense of isolation. My family don't support my education, so they're no help. \n\nHas anyone been in a position where uni was kicking their arse and managed to fix it? Right now I'm looking at the work I have to do and just want to curl into a ball and die. I've always maintained high marks and I want to keep that up, as I feel like it will help me in a competitive work environment where most graduates are several years my junior. I want to finish my degree in a timely manner, but I also don't want to have a nervous breakdown along the way. Halp :(\n\nTL;DR uni stress is destroying me and I don't know whether to pull back or keep pushing through. Any suggestions on how to survive this would be great.

Sounds great right? But there's so many absolutely horrific aspects that come with this. And every single one enough to void this \u201cgreat job\u201d.\n\nOver and over I hear people say how wonderful my situation is, and they're right. But what they fail to understand is how I broke my back, busted my ass hardcore to even get hired. So I got what I deserved from corporate America, but it wasn\u2019t handed to me, I\u2019m not lucky I earned it. So shut the fuck up about how grateful I should be, I know that more than anyone else, especially you.\n\nI was also unaware of the virtually intolerable bullshit that comes standard with working in corporate America, inside a cubicle office where everyone is 2 inches away from you but they still send you emails to say something turning around and talking for 5 seconds could have accomplished. It\u2019s things like that which drive me fucking CRAZY, because you HAVE to respond to every little email/notification or else you\u2019re fired. \n\nNot even 2 days into this job, my competency and intelligence is attacked by my boss in front of everyone. Why? Because the shitty laptop they gave me (Due to this company fucking up royally and not having my equipment ready THEY PROMISED would be) with outlook 2007 sent me 1 *extremely poor worded notification* 5 minutes before a meeting was to be held 2 seconds away from my cubicle, 3 of 6 people who were in that meeting walked right past me, the brand new guy, and didn\u2019t even say \u201chey, we\u2019re having a meeting\u201d. Nor did anyone care to mention anything about mission critical programs/applications on my mystery shitty laptop, essentials any good company would know to debrief a brand new employee on. Or better yet, make a cheat sheet of \u201cmust check\u201d applications.\n\nApparently I was supposed to be an all seeing god knowing how absolutely EVERYTHING techwise is scheduled in a brand new, gigantic company on the 1st real day, and \u201csince I can\u2019t do that much I must be an idiot.\u201d My real work for the day was accomplished, and greatly at that, but context doesn\u2019t exist in corporate America, every tiny thing has your job on the line. Fucking mindless idiots I swear.\n\nVerbatim what my manager said and implied, he threw me under the bus over such a minuscule, insignificant point having 0.01% to do with my real job. Childish and immature is an understatement, this fucking guy is a prick. But more than that, everyone seemingly thinks all this is acceptable human behavior not pointing out how backwards, irritating, and unacceptable it truly is. And guess what? The meeting was about ANOTHER FUCKING MEETING, the most redundant fucking stupid shit ever. \n\nBut I couldn\u2019t explain any of this because he would\u2019ve used the truth as ammo to say I\u2019m just making excuses. A lose-lose situation 100%. Yeah, having unreasonable expectations for a brand new kid STILL IN college like he\u2019s worked here 20 years is pretty normal to me. Said no one ever.\n\nNow for part 2, people who blame the victim for absolutely anything and everything. The context and external pieces of the situation don\u2019t matter at all, the other parties involved leading up to it don\u2019t matter, all that matters is you didn\u2019t do enough to prevent whatever happened to you. \n\nGot shot in an alley? Your fault. T-Boned in an intersection by a drunk driver? Your fault. Mugged then forcibly raped while wearing casual, 100% normal clothing? Your fault. People like this can go fuck themselves and drink bleach while they\u2019re at it, humanity doesn\u2019t need subhuman pieces of shit like you to begin with. God I would murder one of these types of assholes if I could, even If it was only a 30% chance I\u2019d get away with it. I\u2019d take that bet.\n\nI\u2019m on the fence about showing up tomorrow, it was inhuman what I experienced in there and challenging my self respect. Fortunately, Im in a position where I can quit and not be forced to work here for a family etc. I know what I\u2019d be giving up. The sheer level of idiotic, self righteous bullshit I got a glimpse of is enough for any rational person to think this job over, at the very least.\n"}

{"selftext":"OK let me start by saying I have an older daughter who was born 3/22/97. My son was born 3/22/16. So they are exactly 19 years apart. But their births couldn't be more different. \n\nI was 19 with my daughter. Had a full epidural, induced, felt nothing during the whole labor and delivery. They did the most severe episiotomy you could, took 40 stitches to seal it up, vacuumed her out. I hated it, felt like I was just a vessel for the baby, had no control or sensation. I wanted this one to be different. \n\nBut I'm 39 now, dx with gestational diabetes at 22w, mostly diet controlled with a little insulin for fasting numbers. Started swelling and spilling protein in my urine at 33w. I was just below the cut off for pre-eclampsia so they were going to induce at 37w. Baby was measuring 7lbs 8oz by ultrasound at 33w, projected to be 11 lbs at 40w. So I had a lot against me but baby passed all his nst and ultrasounds beautifully. I read the Bradley Method book, Hypnobabies and Hypnobirthing books, hoping this labor would go differently then my daughters. \n\nMidnight on 3/20 I was getting ready for bed and thought I felt a bit of liquid. I went and checked, didn't smell, no color. I put on the depends we'd just gotten that night. In less then 5 minutes I gushed water, went thru 3 depends in 15 minutes. I had some ph strips and checked, sure enough water was broke. But I didn't have any contractions yet. So we slept since I wanted to do a lot of my labor at home. Woke up at 3:30 and still no contractions. Took a shower, bounced on my birthing ball, nothing. Called my doula at 6 am and she said let's go walk Walmart. Went to McDonald's, ate breakfast then walked Walmart in my depends, for 3 hours. I finally started getting contractions 8 -10 minutes apart. \n\nAt about 10:30 we decided to go to the hospital. There they confirmed my water had broke. My ob checked me and my cervix was at 1 and thick so we chose cytotec to get it to thin. One tiny pill inserted vaginally and I lay down for half an hour to let it dissolve. Then I got up to walk the halls. Every half an hour they'd check baby on the monitor and my blood pressure and then let me walk again. My contractions slowly got a little stronger and closer together. But by 5pm I got another cytotec since I was only dilated to a 3 and still thick. Then I walked again. My doulas step counter showed we'd walked 10 miles that day. \n\nBy 9pm I had entered active labor and sat on my birthing ball, leaning against the bed and dozing between contractions. I still couldn't say the contractions were overwhelmingly painful. I could concentrate and breathe thru them no problem. At 10:30pm they checked me again and I was only dilated to a 4. By 11 I started to get the urge to push. The contractions were bad enough I was crying instead of breathing and my doula kept reminding me to breathe. I was in transition and no one realized. She told the nurses I was getting pushy and asked them to check me again, but they didn't, feeling like I had just been checked and probably hadn't progressed much. I was upset, thinking I was hurting my baby by my body pushing too early but I couldn't stop it. I thought I was still a 4. At midnight I couldn't handle it anymore and asked for an epidural. If they'd checked me like we asked and I had been a 6 or more I wouldn't have asked for the epidural, but thinking I was only a 4 was demoralizing. The guy came in and gave me an epidural at 12:30am. It didn't take thankfully! He kept giving me boosters of it and none worked at all. My ob came in then, heard my grunting as I pushed and freaked out. Gowned up, checked me and I was fully dilated and effaced. Baby was at 0 station. The nurses are running around getting the warmer ready and everything. They get my legs up slightly and tell me im going to have to push the baby down since he's still high up. I start pushing just after 1am. I get to feel it all and I loved it! \n\nOn tv, once you push out the head, your done, the baby slides out. Not mine! Birth his head and his chest were 13 cm. So I pushed out his head, thought I was done. Nope, push out the shoulders. Thought I was done. Nope, push out the other shoulder. Then I'm done. He was born at 1:19 am. He's got some blood spots on his eyes that are from the force of me pushing him from 0 station to out in less than 15 minutes. My ob pulled my perineum down and out, so even after all the horrid scar tissue there from my daughter, I had two tiny, one stitch tears this time. \n\nBaby boy weighed 7lbs 9oz, so the ultrasound was off. He was 1am/4 inches long. His lungs were mature so no breathing problems. No blood sugar problems. 9 on the apagar scale. My ob delayed cord clamping, let hubby clamp it. Let my placenta come naturally. But when it separated, the sch area I had in early pregnancy didn't clot well and I lost 2 pints of blood after delivery. Due to blood loss I slept for about 4 hours after delivery, passing out at one point. But my daughter used that time to bond with hey little brother, who had stolen not only her birthday, but her heart as well. \n\nBaby boy is doing well. Just some jaundice issues which is common in premies. Altho he's the biggest premie I've ever heard of! My mother in law was in the room too, got to see him be born and got to cuddle him soon after birth along with my daughter and husband. \n\nI loved my labor. I am so thankful to my family, my doula and my ob that they let me labor my way. I'm also so very very happy the epidural failed and I was able to be an active participant in my own labor and was able to feel the baby slow down and out. It was amazing and I love to do it again one more time before I'm too old!","name":"t3_4ctejh","permalink":"/r/BabyBumps/comments/4ctejh/elijahs_positive_birth_story_at_35_4/","stickied":false,"id":"4ctejh","num_comments":8,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1459477148,"gilded":0,"locked":false,"media_embed":{},"from":null,"thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":"GN","over_18":false,"media":null,"saved":false,"subreddit":"BabyBumps","secure_media":null,"hide_score":false,"from_kind":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s7cl","author":"Allindi001","downs":0,"retrieved_on":1463511832,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_css_class":null,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"title":"Elijah's positive birth story at 35 + 4.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/4ctejh/elijahs_positive_birth_story_at_35_4/","author_flair_text":"Due 4/21 Team Green!","domain":"self.BabyBumps","ups":47,"score":47,"link_flair_text":null}

I have made up my mind that I will own a super car at some point in my life, but I really don't know how I can accomplish this goal.

Second, there would be plenty of opportunities to drive amazing cars. Third I could strategically place the track in a high income area with zero competition from other tracks, so paying off the cost wouldn't be impossible. \n\nI would love to hear any feedback on this plan or if anyone else has looked into it.\n\nEdit: My grades are not as bad as I made them seem haha. I take all honors and AP classes and I have a 90% NGA  so I actually have my life together. Also I come from a fairly wealthily background with lots of connections so then money could happen.

I'm 25, talked to a 30+ year old with a 9 body (in clothes). We (in my mind) clicked well enough. Escalated to makout and ass grabbing. Didn't take her home since I was tipsy and let off the gas to easy when she said she had to go to bed. Great eye contact and banter with this one though, felt good about it.\n\nHere's the deal though: She would pull away most of the times we kissed (faster than I could time). Also she had at least two beta orbiters at the bar who were trying to get her attention. One went as far as to call her and tell her he was leaving and she reassured him that they would meet up soon and she would buy him a shot. \n\nI waited two days and called her. Tried to leave a message but her voicemail was fucked. She responds with a text:\n\"dark_dragoon10 did you just call me? ;)\" I don't respond since I'm not trying to enter her frame. After 30 mins or so she sends another text: \"i'm going to be in your neighborhood tonight. Say hi -hername\"\n\nDon't respond, set an alert to call her again in a week, and went out with my \"wingman\" to the club instead. \n\nAm I right in my logic that this girl isn't that into me (since she didn't return my call) and is just using me as validation and trying to add another orbiter to her herd? I mean a single hot girl in her 30's has so much manipulation experience to where she could be just gaming me for fun and trying to rape my time. It's like I was playing a chess game and didn't realize it till the next day. \n\nI'm going to try being persistent on my own terms once or twice and if she doesn't bite then its NEXT ville.

I'm 5'4 and (currently) 38-30-47.5.  I have a very complex relationship with my shape; I was bullied/oversexualized a lot as a teenager and tried desperately to hide my hips for several years.  Then I started to feel more confident and was pretty stylish (albeit cheap) in college, but after graduation, I began working at conservative company.\n\nEven when I dressed in the same clothes as the other women I worked with, I still looked \"inappropriate\" for this particular company.  I started dressing exactly like my male co-workers after being told an anecdote about women who dress a certain way never being taken seriously (ugh).  Add in a 50 pound weight gain (horrible hip disorder + depression over said hip disorder), and you get a disaster. \n\nI recently left the conservative job to work with my dad as a financial consultant/general helper for our family business.  We do real estate for salons, and I'm frequently in front of high-end stylists.  It's great; I love what I do.  (I've also lost 20 pounds!) The only thing - I'm constantly embarrassed about my wardrobe; these ladies/men look awesome!  \n\nMeanwhile, I have 1 cardigan, 3 dresses (all from college, not great material), 2 pairs of pants (jeans + purple jeans), 2 sweaters, black tights, 1 pair of black flats and 1 pair of black ankle boots. I pretty much live in workout leggings and giant t-shirts and get nervous every time we have an important meeting... Like the one I have tomorrow. \n\nSo, here are a few questions I hope you guys can help with:\n\n1. Do you know any fashion bloggers/celebrities with a similar shape I can get inspiration from?  (Beyond Kim Kardashian)\n2. If you've got similar proportions, what's been your favorite purchase? Favorite stores?\n\nedit 1:  Also important to note, my new job is completely cool with my curves (yay for family business + more curves-accepting industry).

I just want to start out by saying you are all a wonderful group of ladies, and I love to come here every day to read and compare and get my daily dose of \"If she can get through this, I can!\" \n\nWell, I'm having a crappy day for no real reason, which is making me feel even worse because I don't feel justified in being unhappy, if that makes any sense. I don't know what I'm looking for, really, other than a chance to get this off my chest. Sorry in advance for the wall of text...\n\nI've always struggled with weight. I'm 5'7\", and usually hovering around 200 pounds. Due to a bunch of stuff happening last year paired with poor decisions on my part, I was up at 215 by January of this year. Fine. I'm an adult, I can take responsibility for my weight and my actions. I made an action plan (with the support of my awesome husband) for proper exercise and healthier eating. I even drew up a chart to keep track of my weight and keep myself motivated. Then two weeks later...we're having a baby!\n\nI want to stress I'm happy about the baby. This is a wanted and many months hoped for baby, so...I'm thrilled with the prospect of being a mom. But at the same time, it was a wrench in the weight loss plan. So. I decide to keep focusing on moderate exercise, and focus on healthy eating. I talked to my OB, made sure everything was ok with my plan, and decided to focus on having a healthy pregnancy in spite of my weight, and work on me afterwards. And I even passed my first 1-hour GB test with flying colors, yay!\n\nThe I find out that my husband's cousin is also pregnant, due a week before me. This is good and wonderful for her, but she's gorgeous. A personal trainer, crazy fit (seriously; a woman with a visible six pack), just...amazing shape. Who probably weighs half of what I do, if that. I know pregnancy isn't a competition, but my first thought was \"I'm going to be pregnant alongside her????\" Fortunately, she's a sweet person and we get along fine, but it was still a blow. Then her mother, DH's aunt, sends me a FB message: \"Isn't it great how you and Cousin are due at the same time? You guys should be sure to both post bump pictures so we can do side by side comparisons as you grow!\" NO. No, I do not want to see how much bigger I look next to cousin I already dwarf, no way no how NO.\n\nBut whatever. I pick myself, solider on with my walks and my carrots and trying to think positive. Then two days ago, I learn that one of MY cousins is also pregnant...due the week after me. Also a beautiful, small, fit woman. Also a kind and wonderful soul, but so tiny...\n\nThen today, while I'm still struggling to come to terms with what I know is a personal issue, I look at the report from my latest OB appointment and see this item under my physical description: \"Class I Obese.\"\n\nI have seriously spent the last hour crying. I know it's my own fault I'm at this point, but I just feel like a fat blob. I'm 16 weeks, have gained 7 pounds (222 pounds now), and have no bump; I just look fatter than ever. I've tried to tell myself that I can't let it get to me, and that after the baby is born I will be getting some me-time in at the gym, but today it's not helping. And did I mention I now weigh more than my 6'3\" DH???\n\nTL;DR: Obese bumper feeling majorly down about tiny pregnant cousins due the same month and a medical report listing \"Class I Obese\"","num_comments":33,"id":"4ctnpv","stickied":false,"permalink":"/r/BabyBumps/comments/4ctnpv/feeling_bummed_about_weight/"}
