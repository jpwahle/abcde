You study me carefully, your unwavering gaze boring into me, searching for defiance. I'd been with you for only a few days, just one more child in a long line of American blue-bloods, but you could already tell that I was going to be your most challenging prospect.\n\nWhen I don't answer, my frown deepens. \"Ms. Clearwater, it seems that you are having trouble remembering the regulations that govern this relationship. Recite them for me.\"\n\nYou note the slight pout that crosses my face, I've clearly had far too much freedom in my life up till now. Still I stood, as was expected, my back straight and chest out, hands clasped politely behind my back. You admire the line of my cheekbones as the sweet tones of my voice fill the room. \n\n\"I am a lady of bearing and high standing. I am not to speak out of turn. My appearance must always be flawless; my posture always impeccable. I will do all things as my tutor instructs, without question. Poor behavior will be punished, good behavior will be rewarded. I will learn to cook and run a house. I will learn how to please and satisfy the husband of my choosing. I am a lady of bearing and high standing.\"\n\nMy recitation is rewarded as you smile, your hand reaching out to gently stroke my cheek. \"Very good.\" You step to the large cabinet on the opposite wall, sliding it open and retrieving something before turning back around. In your hands rests a metronome, small and beautifully carved. You beckon me to sit. \"I have a gift for you, a way to help you with your studies.\"\n\nYou set the metronome on the table, watching my eyes follow it. Gently nudging it with your finger, the small ivory pendulum clicking left, then right, left then right. Your voice drops, softer now, though I don't even notice as my eyes follow the machine, left then right, left then right. \"Relax,\" I hear you say, the words sounding fuzzy and far away as the metronome softly clicks left, then right.\n\nYou watch as my body begins to sag, my eyelids dropping. You smile as I begin to succumb. Moving to stand behind me, your voice drops to almost a whisper, warm and reassuring, all traces of hardness gone. \"I'm going to count backwards from ten.\" left, then right. \"As I do, I want you to let everything else fall away, until only my voice and the metronome remain.\" left, then right. \"10...9...\" left, then right. \"8...7...feel yourself slipping...6...5...\" left, then right. \"4...3...There is nothing now, just you, the metronome, and me...2...\" left, then right. \"Let yourself go....1...\"\n\n-------------\nSo, I hope that was a good enough prompt! A little about myself: My name's Alexis, I'm 5'9\", about 140 lbs, short brown hair, glasses, 36B cup, I love wearing skirts and tights, anything really feminine. I like generally being Submissive, but I also love bondage, pet play, collars, and mind control/brainwashing/hypnosis/Operant Conditioning. (In case that last one wasn't completely obvious. ;) )\n\nI really want to experiment with being hypnotized and brainwashed (ESPECIALLY hypnotized. With metronomes, which is a VERY big fantasy of mine.) to be a proper submissive lady of class. What I don't want is a magical, \"You're a slave now, let's fuck\" RP. I understand that normal conditioning is boring and you'd rather get to the sexy bits. (I would too. Trust me.) But forcing me to obey and shaping me as you do so is the goal here. And I honestly find the slow conditioning and brainwashing bits to be far sexier than just forcing me to have sex. It's all about subtlety and control and building up to it.\n\nIt doesn't need to pick up where I left off, I just wrote that so people get a general idea of what I want. I might fight the conditioning. But we both know that sooner or later, I'll fall even deeper and lose even more control.\n\nMy only limits are actual bestiality, (As opposed to pet play.) bathroom play,and blood/gore. \n\nI'm looking for an RP partner who's articulate and has at least a basic grasp of the English language. Someone who sends me more than the usual two or three sentences. I'm not talking pages, here, but a paragraph or so would be nice.\n\nREPEAT: If you send me a message full of \"Hey bby u wan sum fuk?\" I will call you out on it, and my words will be unrelenting and harsh.\n\n(Note: This is super long because I tend to get carried way for prompts. Please don't think you need to do posts of this length!)\n\nFeel free to PM me if you want to play, and we'll see if we're compatible. How do you go about molding me into the perfect young lady? What rules do you lay down? What methods of conditioning do you use? \n\nI'm always looking for RP partners and, because I'm feeling EXTRA naughty tonight; any Mistresses or female-identified Dominants will receive priority, but gentlemen, don't let that stop you from controlling my dirty little mind. \n\nAny comments below telling me to PM/kik you will be promptly ignored. I hate when people do that. And if you've read this far, put your favorite colour as the title of your PM.","retrieved_on":1440701252,"ups":3,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"AgeplayPenPals","created_utc":"1433117364","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.AgeplayPenPals","hide_score":false,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"nsfw","title":"[F4A] - A Proper Young Lady [Hypnosis] [D/s] [Upper-Class]","secure_media_embed":{}}

I'm 17, about to turn 18 and this is the last year of what in the USA would be called High School, something like that. Both of my parents are doctors and so are many other members of my family for generations. Ever since I was a kid, I talked about going to med school and follow my parents in the way of medicine. Everyone near us knows that I'll be a doctor, just like my father and my mother. Medicine is a hard course to get in, many people try. There's about 120 candidates per spot in my city's best university. But recently I started having some doubts about that. I'm really good with math (been learning calculus for a while now, even though there's even nothing like precalc in our school curriculum). I study in a great school have great teachers and many of them tell me 'Oh, I'd never think of you going to med school, you should do something related to mathematics!'. I consider this possibility, but my parents are very strict and the one time I told my mom I was considering doing anything not related to medicine, she got reeeally angry at me, not speaking to me for real for some days. My mom is the most easy going one of my parents, can't imagine what would happen if my father found out. I have a great life with my parents, they have good financial condition, they are able to give me everything I want and it is natural that I want to keep my life like that. Also, my parents have a clinic and it'd be given to me if I followed their steps, so that's a bonus. Today I did a entry test in a university (just to train)... I did really well in chemistry (had the most questions tied with biology), physics (got every single question right), portuguese, math and english. But biology, oh boy. I sunk really deep. got less than half of the questions right and pretty much they were all regarding the human body. So I saw that I'm not really good with biology, I guess. I have about 5 months to the big test to decide which career I should choose and I have no clue about it. If I choose not to do medicine, I'll probably have to leave home and risk losing everything good I have right now. Thanks for reading, guys. Really appreciate it.","domain":"self.TrueOffMyChest","hide_score":false,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"TrueOffMyChest","created_utc":"1433117472","author_flair_text":null,"title":"My parents dont understand that I dont want to follow their path.","secure_media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self"}

I'm 20 years old, if that makes any difference to anybody. I don't care what your age is as long as you are good. I live in Kentucky so I'd prefer if you lived Central/Eastern so if we had any intention on going to smaller LANs on the east coast that wouldn't be a problem for you.

We end up getting back together a few months later, three weeks in BAM! We are soon to be parents. But something happens, she turns.

I told her I wasnt ready for marriage or to move in, but that I assuredly wanted to raise this child and care for him and help her in everyway. She does not like this, many ugly arguments later we go our own ways.

It was awkward for them, disturbing to me and I stopped going. \n\nFighting gets bad, texting wars ensues, both of us saying mean things, but her crossing the line. \"I wouldnt subject my poor son to have an live with the embarassment of your last name\"  \"As soon as I meet another man, he will be our boys dad and will call him as such\" \"your not coming to the delivery, Bob (for privacy sake) will be there to welcome MY son to this world\" These were common occuring text messages. Needless to say I found out four days after his birth that he had been born. She allowed me and my mom to see him twice for a total of 3 hours. That is the last I would see of my first child for 9 months. \n\nI have poured my lifes savings into a new car. My previous was twenty years old, I have a good job, and I thought it would be most wise to aquire a safe and reliable form of transportation for my son. And the rest was poured into lawyer and court fees. Nearly two years since this began, we are still going through the final custody steps. I see him 6 days a month, I want half placement, she refuses to budge and insists I lose two days a month and that I pay more child support untop of the 460 i pay monthly (good job does not mean six figures) we have had the child care investigation done, as she refused to continue mediation after the first session to my objection. The next step is trial court. \n\nThere have  been times where she is a decent person, that she talks to me like the boys father. Then the next day she spazzes out blowing my phone up with messages and verball lashings. I went to therapy in the time we where broke up for about 8 months. I was filled with depresison and anxiety, I learned to over come this through meditative sessions and losing my self in sports. In words only i could use to accuratly describe, I became a Jedi. I let go of my hate and resentment and embraced a new approach. I was kind and simple with her, when she would begin her foul moods I would close the line of communication until she had cooled down. \n\nIm just so fustrated. I love my son so much, Ive sacrificed so much in his sake and the only thing I have ever desired in return is his love and additional time with him. My ex has thrown everything in the book from drugs and alcohol to hinting that I inappropriatly touched our son.  \n\nIm so scared of what is going to happen. I feel so....cheated that after all thats happened, everything Ive had to do just to be allowed time with my son I havent gained any ground. Ive told my ex and the judge and GAL \"It takes a man and women to make life. Why am I any less important to have equal time with our child?\"","id":"380raz","archived":false,"link_flair_css_class":"job","name":"t3_380raz","gilded":0,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"num_comments":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"is_self":true,"author":"A_Proud_SaiyanPrince","from":null,"stickied":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/380raz/single_father_ugly_custody_dispute_whats_a_dude/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjdm","from_kind":null,"created":1433121969,"from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"score":3,"edited":false}

I am Eastern European, but my parents acted like stereotypical asian immigrants in that they always privileged school over anything. Even when my mom was sick in hospital, she urged me to leave &amp; study and not worry about her. It's unbelievable looking back now just HOW much time I spent buried in books, solely to get ahead, and really sacrificed my 20's.\nI only started to care about getting out and partying around my mid-20s, but didn't really have a 'core' friend group to get out and party and experience life with. No one to travel with, watch movies with, TV, concerts, etc. I did get out but not very much. I was always working, studying, or hitting the gym (my main interest) and my friends were also the studious type too. Went ahead &amp; pursued law school, and now feel like it really wasn't worth it.\nI can't relate to many of my peers when they bond about TV shows/movies and I'm just like 'uh huh\u2026 think I heard of that'. I'm actually really into arts now and trying to 'catch up' with pop culture but I feel horribly embarrassed and depressed due to it. Has anyone else experienced a similar upbringing or circumstances and how do you deal with it personally? Thought reaching out &amp; maybe just chatting with people about it would help me to deal. One of my coworkers actually straight out asked if I lived on another continent for a while due to not knowing so much about pop culture in the last few years. I can't chime in on many convos due to it but instead of flatly lying about it (many of my coworkers are also gifted and remember fine points of movies, artists, authors, etc.) I don't want to be caught in a lie and would rather just admit I haven't seen it/experienced it, and let them judge if they will. I do read up on current events as much as I can, and movies, so I know the general plot but can't really say more than that. I'm now trying to watch movies of the past decade and listen to music of the '90s that I really didn't get into until recently. I do admittedly feel like I'm from another planet and the alienation is difficult to deal with at times.

{"permalink":"/r/askgaybros/comments/380sdo/helplessly_naive_need_advice/","link_flair_text":null,"media":null,"selftext":"Hello all. Apologies in advance; I expect this post is going to be long and rambling. Thanks to anyone who gets through it, much less responds. I've been struggling with this issue for a while now and wondering whom I could possibly reach out to for advice. I'm not sure whether or not I've found a good place for it. After reading some other posters' questions, I've seen some similarities to my situation and picked up on some patterns. A big one seems to be that there's more than a few people who have had trouble with falling in love with a straight best friend. And, I won't lie, this post is going to look similar to that at first. So here's the situation:\n\nI recently went back to school for a graduate degree. There, I met a man (slightly younger than me) and we seemed to become friends fairly quickly. Within a month or so, we were hanging out at least once a week, usually 2 - 3 times. We'd usually grab a beer, bitch about work, usual things. Purely platonic. When we first met, he told me he was married but then never brought it up again. After awhile of seeing each other this often, I honestly suspected the marriage was a lie he told strangers to keep from being questioned about his sexuality. After a few months, I did eventually meet her, and I've since concluded there was never any hidden romantic feelings toward me; he's just never had a close friend before and didn't know how unusually intimate the relationship had become. Unfortunately, by the time I came to this realization, I also discovered I had developed romantic feelings toward him. So that was a struggle for a little while, but I informed him of the situation and we worked past it. We're still very close, but we've established some healthy boundaries. So that's not so much the problem. \n\nThe problem is I'm 25-years-old and this is the first time I've ever really been attracted to someone or interested in a relationship. I've recognized since I was a teen that I was more attracted to men than women, but honestly the thought of a relationship (physical or emotional) with either had never begun to interest me before. Now that it has, I know that it's something I want down the line. And worse, even though I've generally preferred to keep to myself, I'm starting to feel very isolated.\n\nI think the solution is that I need to date, but I am so utterly naive about all things romantic it's paralyzing. I've never given much thought to whether or not people found me attractive, what sexual position I would prefer or excel at, how much texting is too much, and certainly not anything to do with STIs. I'd more or less written this whole area of life off, and now I feel completely lost. The situation is further complicated because I don't have any regular hobbies outside of full-time work and graduate school. While I know from this recent friendship that I am more than willing to make time for someone, I don't really have time to commit to a regular activity on the off-chance I'll meet someone there. The nearest gay bar is about 2-hours away. Due to my line of work (I work with registered sex offenders) it's not really advisable that I put my information out there, on an app or dating site, for others to approach me.  \n\nAgain, thanks to anyone who made it through that whole mess. I suppose my question is: Where do I begin?

My girlfriend and I just got back from a week-long vacation in your awesome city, and I figured I would help out any future travelers by posting a rundown of our trip and everything we did.  I know before we went, I searched all over this subreddit for the things we had to do, and it was a little overwhelming to figure out what was doable and what wasn't.  I figured I would write about what we were about to accomplish while we were there.  Long post ahead!\n\n**Day 1 - Saturday** - Arrive around noon\n\n* *Dirt Cheap Car Rentals* - One definite thing I learned from this subreddit is that a car rental is necessary. I picked this place because I am 24, and this was the only place that did not charge an under 25 fee.  It was an AWESOME choice.  I paid $120 for a full 7 day car rental.  Granted, I was given a 15 year old Saturn with 220k miles on it, but this was a huge money saver and was definitely worth it.\n\n* *In &amp; Out* - Pretty much a necessity being from the east coast (Philly).  Overall, a little disappointing only because of the hype.  Sorry to say but it just did not stand up to 5 guys. Animal style fries were pretty great though.\n\n* *AirBnb Check in, Pacific Beach* - AirBnb was much cheaper than a hotel, so we chose to use that for our stay.  We split the stay in half.  For the first half, we stayed at a place right off of Garnett in Pacific Beach.  The location was great, since we could walk to a huge amount of bars/restaurants.  While it did seem to be a fairly \"fratty\" area, we don't care too much about going out late anyway so it was definitely no problem for us.\n\n* *Modern Times Fermentorium, Point Loma* - Thanks to /r/beertrade , I have had the privilege of knowing how delicious Modern Times beer is, so it was definitely a priority to go here on the trip.  Honestly, this was our favorite brewery we went to on the entire vacation.  The layout was awesome inside, and the beer was absolutely delicious.  No food here, but this place is AMAZING.\n\n* *Sunset Cliffs, Point Loma* -  I didn't expect much from this considering it seemed to be one of the popular touristy type attractions, but DAMN was it incredible.  Unfortunately we got here way too early for sunset, so we decided we would come back another time to catch that.\n\n* *Iron Pig BBQ, Pacific Beach* - decent bbq.\n\n**Day 2 - Sunday**\n\n* *Torrey Pines Hike* - Probably my favorite park of the entire trip.  This place was incredible. Awesome views, cool trails, just an awesome place.  For reference, we hiked the Guy Fleming, Razor Point, and Beach Trails, then walked back to the parking lot on the beach.\n\n* *Ballast Point Brewery, Miramar* - We love beer, especially sculpin, so this was a must-see.  The bar area was a little rough on the service, but the food was incredible.  Definitely a place to check out.\n\n* *Green Flash Brewery, Mira Mesa* - Green Flash is another one of my favorites, and since it was so close to Ballast Point we had to stop in.  This place was great, and the prices were surprisingly low for a brewery.  I definitely recommend it!\n\n**Day 3 - Monday (Memorial Day)**\n\n* *Hotel Del Coronado, Coronado Island* - Didn't think this place was anything special.  Not sure if it was because of the overcast weather, but I didn't quite see the hype around the hotel.  \n\n* *Burger Lounge, Coronado Island* - We were hungry and stopped in the first place that looked good.  The burgers here were AWESOME. \n\n* *Coronado Brewing Company* - There was another brewery nearby, so obviously we had to stop in.  Nothing incredible, but some solidly tasty beer.  Food looked good, though we didn't eat there.\n\n* *Orient Thai Cafe, Pacific Beach* - We wanted some Thai, and this place looked cool from the outside.  Pretty delicious food!\n\n* *Fred's Mexican Cafe, Pacific Beach* - My girlfriend wanted a post-dinner margarita, so we stopped in this place.  Her margarita was really good, and I was incredibly excited to find out that they had Alpine Brewing Duet on top.  Also, free chips and salsa!\n\n**Day 4 - Tuesday**\n\n* *Kayak/Snorkel Tour from Everyday California, La Jolla* - Unfortunately for us, this ended up being a really chilly, overcast, misty day that not even the wetsuits could protect us from.  The tour itself was great though, we had great guides and the kayaking was a lot of fun.  The water was freezing, but the snorkeling was still pretty cool.  I would have preferred to do the kayak tour of the caves, but the water was too rough and they weren't able to take the kayaks in there anyway.\n\n* *Stone Brewing Bistro &amp; Gardens, Liberty Station* - This place was really, really cool.  The beer was awesome as expected, and the food was delicious too (I ate almost 2 full orders of those hemp seed pretzels).  Also, they had Pliny The Elder on tap which was a cool surprise.\n\n**Day 5 - Wednesday**\n\n* *Breakfast at Kono's Cafe, Pacific Beach* - A little disappointed in this place.  They screwed up the order and gave me a different burrito than I had ordered.  While the burrito's were massive and great value, they pretty much consisted of 6 scrambled eggs with 3 pieces of ham tossed in.  The potatoes were really good though! (after we ate, we walked out to the pier on pacific beach and got to watch dolphins swimming right in front of us for about a half hour, it was pretty awesome!)\n\n* *Children's Pool, La Jolla* - Since the weather was nicer, we went back to La Jolla to check out everything else we wanted.  Children's pool was awesomely hilarious! There was a ridiculous amount of seals there and they are just ridiculously funny creatures.  The smell wasn't that bad.\n\n* *Sunny Jim's Cave, La Jolla* - We walked over to the cave from Children's Pool and hung out with many seals on the rocks along the way.  We decided to spend the $5 each to walk down into the cave and while it was incredibly quick, it was still pretty cool to check out.\n\n* *La Jolla Brewing* - Another brewery, why not.  We didn't drink much here, but the food was delicious and the beer we did try was tasty.  We also stopped at BevMo next door to pick up some beer souvenirs.\n\n* *Check in to 2nd AirBnb location, Sherman Heights* - The location wasn't exactly ideal, as we would have preferred to stay in the north park/hillcrest area or gaslamp, but this was much more affordable.  We were a very short drive/lyft/uber from anywhere we needed to be anyway.\n\n* *Dinner at Urban Solace, North Park* - Fucking DUCKARONI.  The duck mac and cheese at this place was incredible, and I can't even remember anything else about the place because of how good it was.\n\n* *Bottlecraft, North Park* - I had heard about how great this beer store was so I decided to check it out.  Pretty awesome selection, and not unreasonable prices.\n\n* *Mike Hess Brewing, North Park* - We happened to just stop into this place because we were parked right next to it, and we are so glad we did.  The place was awesome, as the taproom was right above the brewery.  They also had an awesome coffee cream ale.\n\n**Day 6 - Thursday**\n\n* *Breakfast at Hash House a Go-Go, Hillcrest* - This place is  NOT overrated.  The chicken and waffles were absolutely RIDICULOUS and I wish I could eat them every day.\n\n* *San Diego Natural History Museum, Balboa Park* - Truthfully this place was a little disappointing.  It was really small and we were out of there in less than 30 minutes.  Maybe I am spoiled from the museums in NY/Philly, but this place was kind of a let down.\n\n* *San Diego Zoo, Balboa Park* - Obviously we had to go. And it was awesome.\n\n* *Padres Vs Pirates, Petco Park* - I hate Pittsburgh more than I probably should, so this seemed like a great game to go to.  The stadium was awesome, with great views of the city. Food and beer at the stadium was great as well.\n\n**Day 7 - Friday**\n\n* *Breakfast at Fig Tree Cafe, Hillcrest* - We had planned to go to Snooze, but the 45 minute late was too long for how hungry we were.  Food here was decent, service was a little subpar.  Overall a fine experience.\n\n* *Mission Bay* - Our last day was left mostly open, so we decided to just relax a little around Mission Bay since it was so nice out and watch the kite-boarders.\n\n* *Casa Guadalajara, Old Town* - Our first legitimate Mexican meal of the trip! Delicious margaritas and awesome food.  The tamal was amazing.  It was also right next to some really cool Mexican shops that were fun to walk around. (Also, i randomly decided to stop into Fuller's Liquors in the area, and grabbed the last bottle of Pliny the Elder they had!)\n\n* *Cabrillo Tidepools/National Monument* - We didn't really have a huge desire to go here but since we had some time we decided to, and truthfully I wish I had planned to spend more time here.  We missed low tide at the tidepools, but the area was still really cool.  Also, the view of the city from up by the monument was awesome!\n\n* *Modern Times (again)* - We needed to kill time before sunset, so we stopped back at Modern Times.  That''s how good it was.\n\n* *Sunset Cliffs for sunset* - We came back to Sunset Cliffs later in order to watch the sunset, but unfortunately it was super cloudy out so it still wasn't all that great.  Still a great spot.\n\n* *Chinese Food from Dragon's Den, Gaslamp* - I heard you had bad Chinese food in San Diego, but damn that was bad. \n\n**Day 8 - Saturday: Flight Home**\n\n\n**Notes**: Definitely rent a car.  Without it, this trip would have been impossible.  I also recommend splitting the stay between a beach town/city.  It makes it easier to check out everything.  Also I found traffic to be practically nonexistent compared to the Philly area.  I think the 5 lane highways in San Diego might have something to do with that. One thing I really wish we did was go to some more mexican restaurants/taco shops.  This was also a very physically tiring trip. We did so much during the day that we were just way too exhausted to go out at night, which was perfectly fine for us. In the end, it was an awesome vacation.  We are hoping to try to move out to San Diego sometime in the next couple years, so I really hope we can work that out!\n\n\n**TL;DR: Rent a car, go hiking, drink beers.**","media":null,"ups":193,"retrieved_on":1440701195,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/sandiego/comments/380tkm/my_vacation_to_san_diego/","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"My vacation to San Diego","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1433119489","subreddit":"sandiego","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.sandiego"}

Honestly... I have no idea what I came for, just got a thought to come here.\n\nI'm a very strong person inside and I am able to keep all the bad things inside me, normally no one could read from me, that I have problems (or maybe I'm just lying to myself and all of you...). Anyway I know I can keep my feelings really deep inside. I know, there are people with additional senses that can feel how someone's feeling (I think I'm also one of them).\n\nAbout my problems? I'm lonely. I'm not sure I can understand why that happens, because people occur to tell me that I'm handsome, that I'm quite smart. On another side I'm annoying and I have ironic humor/lifestyle. I'm trying to not be annoying and rather be friendly or... just be nice. Thoguh all the people, who could stand me being annoying, just disappeared. They just left me. No regrets I saw in them. I just can't understand how bad creatures people are. I didn't do any surveys, but as far as I had chance to meet people they don't really talk. I'm a person, who would love to help anyone anytime, talk to others about rather serious stuff, but I could talk about anything and not like: \"**Hey.**\" \"*Hey.*\" \"**What's up?**\" \"*Nothing*\". Sometimes I don't even get answer on my question, which is annyoing.\n\nAt some point I give up on people, I feel like I already learned to live without them, no need for them, but wait. I'm 18, near end of high school and... what? Work. What can I do? Where? I actually know what I like: languages, real, fiction, proggramming ones. So what's the problem? I'm very long time without any support, you know those situations, when you made something and someone yelled: \"Yay, man! It's fantastic!\" I feel like... All the things I can... I actually think I can't do a thing. I'm Polish, okay? So yeah, you see I can type in English. For me, it's ok. I'm quite happy with my communication skills. But what does the CEO of the firm think? Is it good for him? Or he thinks I do a lot of mistakes? I'm scared that I may fail, yes I know it's natural, but I'm so scared of this that I'm afraid to ask for a job. It goes both with my English and HTML/CSS and programming skills. I have read a lot, wrote wall of texts in English, tried to do things in computer science, but I'm sceptic to all of this.\n\nI feel I have something what's stopping my head from thinking, it may be somewhere here, whatever, I don't even know what to add here. I started this post with no idea what to write and I end it in someway being nervous, because I still don't know what to add. Did I wrote all of this right? Is it clear? Those questions are in my head like everyday. I feel like I'm able to understand people without problem, though I'm scared that someone misunderstand me...\n\nI may add something later if it comes to my mind... If you got any questions - ask me, I'm open book. Though I'm asking you for some kind of support, if you could...\n\nEdit: I think I should add this: I have some kind of depression through all of this... Several years, can't exacly say how long. I'm not close to kill myself at any point. Not yet at least. I think it may actually happen after few years, if I stay scared and lonely (I'm seriously not sure if I can actually live without people), or anyday, but it's rather unlikely. I used to fight with this by finding people to help both someone and myself, I still try to meet knew people, but spending time alone is way easier than it used to be, I could hurt myself to earlier, because I couldn't stand being alone.","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/SuicideWatch/comments/380tyd/i_think_i_just_need_some_support/","is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"thruwaycuzIneed","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_380tyd","id":"380tyd","archived":false,"num_comments":9,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"edited":1433120187,"score":4,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/380tyd/i_think_i_just_need_some_support/","secure_media":null,"created":1433123272,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qpzs","from_kind":null}

I have a very overprotective, Asian tiger mom who's a bit of a helicopter parent. I'm generally extremely sex-positive and open, but she thinks I'm still saving myself for marriage and has extremely negative and degrading views of sex. I didn't expect her to go through my mail, but she was grilling me on what was in the package. I got to my room, opened it up, then kicked it under the bed. Later she came in and started questioning and asking to see the box. She grabbed it from under my bed and began screaming at me, calling me sick and deranged. We talked and I tried to keep as calm as possible, and most of her anger she tried to say was because I was keeping secrets from her and lying to her. I tried explaining that it was my body and it was a private issue that most people really aren't comfortable with sharing with their mothers. She thinks I'm an awful sexual deviant now and it doesn't help that I've recently been diagnosed with bipolar and BPD, so she's been using it to further \"prove\" that I'm deranged. I've offered for us to make an appointment to the gynecologist so we could talk about it, but she angrily replied that instead she'll do her own internet research. She also gets fucking FURIOUS when I talk to men or express interest in them, and this vibrator has been causing a lot of \"you're obviously a slut who makes horrible decisions and so you should be kept away from men for your own good\". Yeah I know, I'm 20 and I'll probably be told to just move out but I'm in a therapy program right now and that's just not feasible. What can I do to calm my mom down? It kinda sucks being told I'm sick and deranged all the time. \n\n\n\n\n\nTldr; mom found my vibrator, she thinks I'm sick in the head.

A few components on the inside are fried and I am determined to figure out how to test them, what failed, and to eventually fix this light myself. Hopefully, I can keep the interest going. Bought a multimeter and a soldering station.\n\nI eventually want to move to arduino and building guitar pedals, maybe something else. I dont know what else I can do with this hobby, but I would like to find out.\n\nIve started on the Khan academy portions of the beginner tutorials in the wiki, and Ill beg, borrow, or steal every shred of information I can get my hands on to keep going.\n\nJust wanted to say: thanks for being here, /r/electronics","retrieved_on":1440701173,"ups":19,"permalink":"/r/electronics/comments/380v90/thanks_for_being_here/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Thanks for being here","subreddit":"electronics","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1433120273","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.electronics"}

{"link_flair_text":"Relationships","permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/380x9y/me_32_f_and_my_husband_39_m_have_been_married_12/","selftext":"Ok, I'm going to try to keep this as short as I can.  13 years of history is hard to sum up.  \n\nMy husband has always been a little controlling but over the last 5 years or so it's gotten even worse as he was diagnosed with anxiety disorder.  He has so little control over his life that he seizes on to anything he can control, including me.  He uses guilt and religion to isolate me and makes it really difficult to have my own friends or a life separate from being home and taking care of him.  We were co-dependent to a very unhealthy level.  The best way I can put it is that I'm always on a very short leash.  I'm 32 years old and basically had a curfew for crying out loud.\n\nHe did seek counseling when the anxiety attacks and issues first set in but he refused to take medication or do a lot of the therapies that were suggested and eventually even stopped going to counseling.  I did leave for just over a week about 4 years ago when things were really bad, but I didn't have a lot of outside support and wasn't sure what to do, so I went back and nothing really significant changed.\n\nOn top of that, he struggles with an addiction to pornography that has really affected our intimate life over the years.  Now, I don't have a problem with porn if it's done with all parties aware, if it isn't something that replaces the intimacy in a relationship but is something that can help create that intimacy.  I have a problem when it's taking my place or causing damage to our intimacy and relationship overall.  \n\nA few months ago I had reached my limit and ended up moving out to stay with friends for a while, just for a break and to give me some space to figure out what I really want.  One night when I had agreed to go home for dinner and try to talk some of our issues out, he confessed to having more than just issues with pornography over the course of our 12 year marriage, but that he has also had what he called \"inappropriate conversations\" with 4 or 5 other women online.  In other words, he has had 4 or 5 online affairs.  \n\nThis was particularly painful to me because of an incident during our second year of marriage.  I discovered when searching for a recipe in my husband's email a whole folder full of very explicit emails he was exchanging for months with someone he knew in college.  I almost left then but we talked about it, he severed all communication with her, and we moved on the best we could.  \n\nTo be told that he sought that kind of relationship online with 4 or 5 other women over the last 10 years or so after what the first time did to us was beyond hurtful.  He claims that it wasn't cheating especially with these 4 or 5 because they weren't as explicit and were strangers to him that he would never have met or considered actually doing anything with in person, but to me it doesn't matter.  I promised myself after the first time that if it ever happened again, I was done.\n\nOn top of all this, I realized I was falling in love with my female best friend.  I have known that I'm attracted to women for years but did all I could to ignore it and if those feelings ever crept up on me, I would just push them aside and tell myself that I might be bisexual but I'm married and would never act on it.  Suddenly the feelings wouldn't be shoved aside, and trying to do so took me to a very dark place where I was questioning my will to live.  \n\nMy friend and I had always been a little flirty but as soon as she got the truth out of me, she admitted to finding me very attractive as well and we got very flirty. I was suddenly smiling all the time and felt attractive and sexy in a way I never have before.  It didn't take long before I started to actually value myself a little more.\n\nNow my friend is in a committed relationship herself and so I knew nothing would ever happen between us, but I realized that if she was free, I would have left my marriage for her in a heartbeat.  That realization had a huge impact on me.  Over the last couple months of having space and really thinking about what I want, I'm pretty sure I'm actually more gay than straight.  I've read books and taken quizzes and it all confirms that as much as those things can.\n\nMy husband is aware of these feelings but isn't interested in bringing anyone else into our relationship to allow me to explore these feelings that I'm finally ready to accept.  He thinks he can just change things up in the bedroom and satisfy me better so I won't need to.\n\nMy work benefits thankfully include EAP benefits, so I started seeing a counselor when all this started but I'm out of sessions now and struggling to find someone else I can see that I can afford, which is part of the reason I'm posting here.  It helps to hear a bunch of different perspectives and opinions.  I'm like 99% sure I want a divorce and that I want to explore my sexual orientation and what it's like to actually live on my own for the first time ever, but at the same time I feel enormous guilt at thinking about actually following through.  \n\nI do still care for my husband and love him, I want him to be happy, but I just can't imagine that both of us would be as happy as we deserve to be if I stay in this marriage.  We tried a couple marriage counseling sessions but they were awful and really only seemed to confirm that things won't work.  He is now saying that he wants to change and work on things and try to be better at making sure I'm taken care of instead of everything being about him, but it feels like it's too little too late.  My heart just isn't in it anymore.\n\nIf he says he's wanting to work on things and he's not going to seek other women online anymore, am I wrong to not allow him that opportunity at this point, after everything else?  I just can't help but feel like it's more manipulation from him, that he's just saying whatever he needs to to get me to come back under his influence.  I don't even think he realizes that's what he's doing, I don't think any of it comes from him wanting to hurt and control me, it's just who he is and what he's learned.  I know I didn't help in that I let it continue for so long without standing up for myself and my happiness.\n\nThose of you that have had to decide to break up with and/or divorce someone, how did you get there, how did you know it was ok?\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: My husband is controlling and has been unfaithful, I am gay and ready to accept it, but he wants to work on the marriage and I feel like it's too little too late and want to divorce him, but for some reason I feel incredible guilt and can't get myself to actually take real action since moving out a couple months ago.","media":null,"ups":12,"retrieved_on":1440701148,"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1433121238","subreddit":"relationships","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.relationships","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Me [32 F] and my husband [39 M] have been married 12+ years, control and fidelity issues abound and I recently accepted/realized that I'm gay - why can't I move forward to divorce?","from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","created":1433124838,"from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/380x9y/me_32_f_and_my_husband_39_m_have_been_married_12/","secure_media":null,"stickied":false,"edited":false,"score":12,"quarantine":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":10,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"name":"t3_380x9y","link_flair_css_class":"m-vt relationships","gilded":0,"id":"380x9y","archived":false,"from":null,"author":"owlmusic82","is_self":true}

{"ups":21,"retrieved_on":1440701146,"selftext":"Wow.  I have been with Susie (Not her name) for 19 years.  It has always been rocky, but the last two years have been hell.  Two years ago July, my wife met  a Hobo when she was bargaining shopping at the Salvation Army.  She offered to let him do chores for food and a small amount of cash.  He soon was sleeping on our couch.  We offered to convert the garage into a small apartment or to allow him to live in our RV, but he was not interested.  He seemed to always be around and usually  slept on the couch.    Last Summer my wife and I seemed to be very happy and every one commented on how we acted towards each other.\nThen my wife suggested that I go out and see the Eagles concert by myself.  That was odd as she kept texting me and asking if I has set up a secret date.   When I came home, it appeared that she was on a date with Hobo.   In late October, she told me that I had to move out as we are done, done, done.  I moved into the garage, as we had a lot of faux break-ups over the last 19 years.  My wife then asked me out for a Halloween party.  Before we went out, we had to go jump Hobo's 30 year old junker car.  My wife was in a panic as his battery was dead.   A few days later, my wife told me to just give her some space and we would get through this.  Hobo was now living on the couch full time.\n     A few facts:  Wife comes from a very wealthy family that does not give her any money.   She hasn't worked in 15 years. A bone of contention is that I do not make enough money.  I generally earn between $10,000 and $15,000 a month.  Hobo hasn't had a job in 8 years since he was released from a long prison term.  The whole situation was unbelievable.\nShe was 27 when I met her, I was 44.  She sort of freaked out when I hit 60, of course she is now 46.  I'm in better health than she is.\nI took her at her word that she needed two months, it stretched out to 7 months.  In May, she said she was going to visit her rich family for a couple weeks, about 50 miles away.   I left her alone, but then had business nearby and stopped by to say hi and was shocked to see Hobo driving her car.\nHobo had his \"beater\" car towed away.  The car was worth less than the $300 towing charges, So I told him I would help him get a car.  Suzie was calling me in a panic as Hobo's car had been towed.\nThen on May 20th, I was on my way to work when I saw out RV parked in an odd place.  I stuck my head in to see what was going on and saw the two of them fucking.  (I was so dumb for so long.)  I resolved to end the marriage.  But Susie pleaded that this was an aberration and she wanted to stay married.  The Hobo is gone, apparently living in the RV.\n      Now, my wife is always gone.  She goes grocery shopping and is gone for five hours.  This morning she went to church at 7 and is still not home, 12 hours later.\n     Ok, I'm a fool to even bother to write this.  Its been a very good 18 years.  We traveled the world and had many wonderful times.  Until the last 8 months.  I have checked out dating, but dating at 63 is nothing like it was at 29.  There is no way that Suzie can stay with this Hobo.  Which a counsler told me that when a person has an affair with an unacceptable person, that person is making a statement, not seeking a replacement.  But this has gone on way to long.  She insists we are back together, but she is always gone.  She continually argues that women I causually know were in fact torrid affairs (they weren't) as if that justifies her behavior.","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/relationship_advice/comments/380xf5/my_wife_is_fucking_and_spending_all_her_time_with/","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"My wife is fucking and spending all her time with a homeless guy!

Lurker here, due 11/14. A little backstory to begin - before I found out I was pregnant I had just officially lost 20 pounds from my highest weight. I've never been fashion minded, but wanted to expand my wardrobe some. I'm 22 and want to be able to look more adult and put together when I leave the house.  While looking up fashion basics I discovered the idea of a capsule wardrobe. Of course, getting knocked up threw a giant monkey wrench in the mini-shopping trip I was planning on taking. To cut my rambling short, I'm now 15 weeks along and won't be able to wear my normal shorts and jeans for much longer. I'm obviously hoping to only need my maternity clothes for a relatively short period of time so here's the question - does anyone have any experience with doing a capsule styles wardrobe while pregnant? Or where did you find cute maternity clothes? Or hell, fashion advice in general? I'm a blank slate!  I'm 5'2 and was pudgy pre-pregnancy and while this may come across as a very vain post, I was just rediscovering my self-confidence and feeling good about myself physically again before I got pregnant. My self esteem has taken a tail spin in the past few weeks and I feel like feeling sexy again will help. \n\nThanks in advance!

I try to rub my eyes, but a heavy clanking alerts me to the fact that my arms are chained above my head. I try to move my head; same thing. There's barely any leeway in my restraints. It feels like my legs are bound as well. I can feel the bands of metal restraining them, pulling my knees to my chest and out to the side. I feel the barest breeze on my pussy....\n\nWait.... What?\n\nIt dawns on me that I'm not wearing any clothes. I can feel the air against my bare pussy and asshole. I can also feel something stuck up both of my holes. Not big, but round and smooth.

I can feel a big rubber ball prying my jaws apart; a line of drool already slipping from the corner of my mouth.\n\nI try to think back, to remember just how I got here, but I can't recall. A heavy fog coats my mind, making me feel sluggish and heavy: sleepy, my senses dulled.\n\nAs I struggle weakly against the chains, I hear a loud **CLUNK** come from the other side of the room. A door opens, letting in a blinding light, and closes before my eyes can adjust. I hear heavy footsteps approaching; then a pause, the rustling of fabric, and a sharp poke in my arm. The needle gets taped down, and a bright light snaps on in front of my face.\n\nBlinking, I try to make out more details of the room, but all I can see is a tube leading from my arm, up into the pitch black. I've had IVs before, but why now? I'm not sick.... Am I?\n\nSuddenly, you step in closer, so I can make out your shadowy figure.\n\n\"There's a good girl. Let's just wait for the drugs to take effect, shall we?\"\n\nI don't know what you're talking about, but I can feel my body growing heavy, the fog in my mind growing heavier, head swimming....\n\nA few minutes later, you make a pleased noise, \"Perfect. Now, I'm going to remove your gag. I don't want you to scream, okay?\"\n\nI barely register your words through my drugged haze, but I nod anyway.  You smile to yourself and I feel a sudden pulse in my pussy, making me groan out loud.\n\n\"Good girl.\" You say calmly. \"Soon we'll have that reaction linked to just those words... And to your obedience. But that's going to take some conditioning.\"\n\nYour big, strong hands reach down and remove my gag as you speak, and you even wipe the spit off of my chin. \n\n\"Now, I'm going to ask a few questions. For every one you answer honestly....\"\n\nI feel the pulse in my pussy again, stronger this time. You chuckle at my groaning.\n\n\"Looks like the aphrodisiacs in that drug cocktail are working. There's a lot of other things in there but I don't really understand it. Anyway, for every question you get *wrong* ....\"\n\nThe collar around my neck emits a sharp **BEEP** and I feel a surge of electricity arc up and down my spine, racing through my nipples and clit. It hurts so much, especially after the pleasure I was just feeling. It feels like my skin, my muscles, even my thoughts are on fire. \n\nI feel myself black out for a moment, and you grin. \"Understand? Good.

I've tried so many different things now that I really don't know what is left. \n\nBenzoyl peroxide worked wonders, but somehow my skin started getting very sensitized to it. Now it induces pretty bad redness that never seems to lessen, and it seems to make my skin even oilier. I've tried only applying a small bit at night, and that doesn't seem to help with redness either.\n\nSalicylic acid/AHA Glycolic acid dries my skin out so much, but seemed to help a bit. Salicylic acid, on the other hand, has only ever caused me tons of white heads that never seem to go away until I stop using the product.\n\nRetinoids of any strength, even lower-strength ones like differin, have caused extreme redness, even when used sparingly at the start.\n\nAczone worked decently, but I couldn't handle the extreme oil slick it caused me. Even oil blotters couldn't handle all the oil.\n\nMore natural treatments, like tea tree oil and the oil cleanse method, haven't proven very useful for me either. And don't get me started on oral supplements. I tried taking probiotics once and it made me skin break out terribly. More recently I tried some supplements to help on a hormonal level. Things like saw palmetto and stinging nettle. These also caused a massive breakout and even oilier skin.\n\nThose are all the ones I can think of off the top of my head. To be fair, my skin isn't terrible, but I feel like it's worse than the average 26 year old male's skin. It's definitely put a damper on my enthusiasm for for being outgoing and it's killed my confidence. I'm thinking about seeing a Derm to ask about Finacea which is 15% Azelaic acid. It's primarily for rosacea sufferers, but considering a dermatologist once thought I had rosacea, it could be helpful.\n\nAny advice you all have would be much appreciated.

It seems relevant to several threads placed here.\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\nI was only 16 when I placed World Champion Sub-17 the first time; and it was, I believe it was, the first time that Colombia went to that Championship, so that was a very happy moment, I was very glad.\n\nName: Luis Javier Mosquera. I'm from Yumbo Valley, I was born on '95 and I'm 19 years old. I started weightlifting 9 or 10 years ago. My achievements are: National Champion Sub-15, National Champion Sub-17, Youth National Champion, and now with the help of god I'll go to be senior National Champion too. I am also South American and Pan American Sub-15 Champion, World Champion Sub-17 Twice, silver medalist Youth World Champion and Youth World Champion.\n\nThis is a sport that I like since I was a kid, since very early, when I first watched it; and I like it because I like to put out a lot of force, use my strength, and therefore it means a lot to me.\n\nI was already slacking a little bit, and then I realized I was going to become a father. That motivated me to train harder and to try to give my son a future.\n\nSince 2011 that I have been winning world championships, they have always told me: \"yes, we are going to fix the gym\". It has been going on for four years now. They always come around after I grab a medal and say: \"Oh no, yes, we are going to fix it\", or \"we will do such and such\". But nothing ever happens, they always leave you hanging on hopes and I don't want it just for me (the fixing of the gym) I want it for the new talents coming. \n\nTwo years ago they promised me a house and they haven't delivered yet. I am still hopeful and I keep my optimism, they haven't said anything, I don't know if they know me (Official representatives) I don't know anybody, just the people in weightlifting, my sport. The manager, or other members of the committee in the Valley, I don't know who they are, and they don't know me. One is supposed to go looking for them but since I am from Yumbo sometimes it is hard for me to be going to Cali often.\n\nSometimes you are down, sometimes you are up. I would like, that, not only with me, but also with other fellow sportsman, they were constant in their support of us.

Got super sick with Lyme disease, too much joint pain to even go to work on some days let alone get out of bed, and after 8 hours the antibiotics took the rest of my energy. Long story short I'm 26 years old, 6'2 and I'm down to 190lbs and all of my muscle feels like it's gone and I feel very weak. \n\nThese past few days I've finally finished my cycle of hardcore antibiotics and so far I feel ok and better than I have in awhile. I think at this point if I spend a few days getting good sleep, eating as much as I can (still have almost no appetite food is nauseating) then I'll have the energy and strength to start getting back in there. \n\nThe few times I've tried to workout over the past month just to spend time there and remember what it feels like it's been very basic. I can't currently do over 15lbs with individual free weight bicep curls for example, and after about 6 reps my left arm can't lift it anymore and the form is totally gone thus making it useless and potentially dangerous to push that harder. I used to be able to bicep curl 55's and needless to say it's very depressing to be in this state. \n\nI guess what I'm asking here, is how should I go about getting back to this and doing it properly and safely? My body's been so weak and out of it for so long, but at the same time I don't want to be a bitch about it either and hate how I feel like I look sickly and frail right now.","id":"38127i","archived":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_38127i","saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":18,"is_self":true,"author":"MyGoatIsBrown","from":null,"stickied":false,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/38127i/ruined_by_lyme_disease_trying_to_recover_how_to/","from_kind":null,"created":1433127348,"subreddit_id":"t5_2ql8s","from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"score":21,"edited":false}
