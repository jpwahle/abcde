Since entering the workforce after college I have migrated to the left politically over time and eventually began to suspect that our society's relationship to and attitudes about work were deeply unhealthy and only served the capitalist class. Then y'all appeared in the news, well done.\n\nAnyway, I have a number of shitty job stories. The first job out of college was at a cupcake shop in Seattle, Trophy Cupcakes. The pay was shit but I had no experience and this was in 2011, when there were very few available jobs. The simple repeated action of frosting the cupcakes killed my back, the training was pathetic, and I'll never forget the day the general manager appeared after my morning shift had started about two weeks after I took the job, at a location I had only worked in once, where I had not been trained for a solo opening shift and after only doing one solo opening shift at my usual location. So obviously I was behind in getting all the goddamn cupcakes ready, and the manager walks in and says \"you're really behind\" and I said \"I know\" and instead of doing any one single thing to help, just walked into his office and closed the door. This was the beginning of my hatred for management.\n\nI left after 5 weeks to work for a staffing company contracted by Nintendo of America to run their customer service department. They hire around October and November en masse for the holiday season and then after New Years start laying off around 90% of the people they just hired. At least the training program was good. However, not long after I finished training, I got to work one day only to be herded with the rest of my disheveled coworkers into a single room so they could tell us that all the full time actual Nintendo employees who were getting benefits were being laid off to be replaced by our sorry asses and they needed space because they were crying and pretty soon everyone knew that more than one of these employees, who were women nearing retirement age, were devastated because they didn't think anyone else would hire them and now their whole retirement was fucked.\n\nThis was the first of two times this kind of thing happened at a tech company workplace. The second was at Voicebox Technologies, which no longer exists because they did this while they were trying to make Bixby (Samsung's voice assistant thing), and that's why Bixby sucks. Happy to report I worked very little at that job after they pulled the mass layoffs of their full time employees because fuck them.\n\nBack to Nintendo, I'm sorry to say I didn't quit or even work poorly (impossible due to the insane amount of company surveillance they use at that place) after the layoffs. When I did quit was after I learned that after 10 months of employment, I would be \"laid off\" due to the fact that it was a contract position and state law required anyone working longer than this for the same company in the space of a year had to become full time staff with mandated benefits. So to get around this, every customer service stooge who makes it past the post-holiday layoffs, which I did by being amazing at the job even though it aggravated the fuck out of my anxiety, is \"laid off\" after 10 months but is \"guaranteed\" a re-hire after being gone for the following two months until they could start the process over again. Instead, I used those two months to find a new job.\n\nI also worked for Pagliacci Pizza as a delivery driver for close to a year, and the manager there had a real problem with the fact that I didn't give any wiggle room when calling out. I refused to work while sick because it's FOOD SERVICE and I also had to call out sometimes because I get migraines. Anyone who gets migraines understands why it would be extremely dangerous to attempt driving with one. One time this manager actually tried to get me to come into work when I had the flu because he claimed physical activity would help me get better. I did not believe him and I did not work that day. When I quit, I didn't quite give the full two week's notice and that asshole put me on the schedule for the day AFTER my last day there. When I asked the assistant manager about it, he rolled his eyes and mumbled some shit so I'm pretty sure the manager was being a petty little shit. Obviously I didn't work that day, either, lol.\n\nOh then there was my first job that in any way used my degree in writing, a digital marketing company that I think also no longer exists, and thank fuck. They turned out to be awful scammers and though my original manager was actually a good guy in a lot of ways (not sure if he knew about the scam or rationalized it or what), he got pushed out and deposed by a total sleazeball from sales who was a sexist piece of shit always bragging about his lake house. Once we moved offices and I was put next to the sales department so I could hear the things they were saying, I realized they were just scamming old folks into paying thousands for useless \"ecommerce\" websites and went to work finding a new job. Marketing is the devil.\n\nEventually, after a LOT of severely underpaid work and a stroke of luck, I was able to carve out a freelance writing career that allows me to work from home, 20-25 hours per week and survive. Working less hours has allowed me to focus on myself and my mental health. I have grown so much more as a person and learned so much about how fucked capitalism is these past couple years. I still often feel guilty that I work so little while others work so much to survive but I'm trying to live my life as an example of how BAD working like that is for you and how much better off people can be with significantly less than 40 hours per week of the kind of work that makes money for someone else, with you getting back a pittance.\n\nObviously I still think the whole system has to go, but if you can work less than 40 hours per week and are only being held back by guilt, FUCK the guilt, fuck the culture, fuck work. Not only can you become a better person better able to support and help others, you're literally contributing to the degrowth that many esteemed climate scientists say we need to get in motion if we're going to mitigate the devastation of climate change.\n\nFuck work or die.

This is my first post on this subreddit, so I figured I would make it more formal explaining a little about myself, what I am looking for, and why I joined Reddit.\n\nAbout Me Vanilla: I am 6'3 with brown hair and brown eyes. Approximately 225, with a more muscular build. I enjoy working out 3-4 times a week. Career wise, I just began a job with a local start-up in Austin. My other interests include being outdoors, talking sports, talking history and enjoying a nice drink out in the city.\n\nI am definitely a softer Dom. I'm a fan of DDLG, bondage, praise, commanding with toys, corsetry, and impact play (nothing that leaves lasting body harm obviously), use of nylons\/fishnet leggings. I'm experienced (2 years) with mature women (10-25 years my senior) as well as submissives closer to my age (18-25).\n\nWhy Join Reddit?\/What Am I Looling For: After seeing this subreddit, I was intrigued to test the waters and see where the world of Reddit kinksters will take me. For those of you more local- yes, I can host regularly. However, being local is NOT a requirement for this dynamic, rather it would just add another dimension. Regarding desirable features in a sub, I asl only that you have an open mind and a loyal heart. \n\n\nIf you read this far, clearly I have your interest, so reach out and let's see where things go.

I then told her \" This is weird now, I am 17.\" Then I got a message from a different number saying \" YO UR TEXTING A 14 YEAR OLD\" and that's when I said that not anymore because I just found out about their age and because I'm not a weirdo.

I shut it down immediately and deleted her number after finding out her age.

I'm appealing to you all for genuine advice from a male and female perspective. \n\nI married my husband a couple of months ago because at the time I was convinced it was the right thing to do. I'm 25, and never really had much experience speaking to guys. I've never been on a date physically with a man so I've always kind of been clueless to how the whole marriage thing works. But I knew that as a Muslim sister it's wise to find a good man and settle down within good time as it gets difficult down the line. \n\n3 years ago I worked with this man for a few months and was able to have some conversation and banter between us. He was practicing and seemed handsome to me. I left that workplace after. A year later he reached out to me online showing his intention for marriage. I felt like deep down I liked this man and got along with him so I agreed to speak to him with the intention of marriage. I should've insisted to meet a few times in person but i shyed away from this as he never brought it up and hence I didn't either. I would constantly tell myself that I knew him because we'd worked together in the past and that meeting wouldn't add anything new to our situation. \n\nDuring this time we were both not ready for marriage and so we'd text and call and get to know each other in this manner. Eventually I decided with myself that due to his manners, personality and deen I would put my trust in Allah and get married. Before I married him I would tell myself that there isn't much chemistry or an excitement to speak to him but I realised that I found him handsome and so I must be interested in that way. I don't know why, but I've always gravitated towards the under dogs in life rather than going for those that I genuinely was into. He seemed like a humble brother that really liked me and so i gave him the benefit of the doubt. \n\nFast forward to when we got married I instantly after a few days realised I'd made a mistake because now that we were spending time together in person I could see that I had no sexual attraction for him. his demeanour and persona was completely different to what i expected and being with him just feels like I'm with a relative rather than spouse. For whatever reason I'm just not attracted to him. Should I have known this? Am I in the wrong? And what do I now do? \n\nNow that I m already married I've been trying my best to take accountsbility and try my best to work on the chemistry  Several months in and I can't see myself being attracted, this affects our intimacy as we seem emotionally and sexually distant from each other. Is this something I can work on? \n\nHaving this issue in my relationship makes me regret and miss a potential that I let go of so that I can pursue this current relationship. I was a lot more attracted to the other but i assumed someone more religious was better however i downplayed the importance of attraction and connection. \n\nI feel stuck because otherwise he is a good man, I don't know how I would be able to justify a separation. I don't have kids with him and I plan to not have any until we can fix this one way or another. \n\nMy whole life I grew up religiously committed and quite sheltered, I made this decision for the right reasons and with the best intentions but now I'm in a predicament.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MuslimMarriage","subreddit_id":"t5_39x1d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/MuslimMarriage","subreddit_subscribers":35350,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I am in a huge predicament.

It started about a year ago, when I was still with my ex (we were together for about 2 years). I started having a lot of performance issues in the bedroom, an inability to get started easily, a general lack of interest in being sexual, and difficulty around actually having penetrative sex (I'd lose the erection). I chalked it up to a number of things, including work and school stress, and to be honest less overall attraction to my girlfriend (she had put on like 30+lbs) and we were not in a good place, obviously. Several times she cried when I went soft and I felt awful. She didn't want me to go down on her or anything else, that was the only way for her. The communication just was not there on her side, I didn't know what was up with me on mine, but I was pretty sure it was a mental issue. Now I'm not so sure.\n\nAbout three months later, we broke up (she wanted to find someone \"further along in life\") and things got even worse. I tried doing a few one-night stands\/hookups, but in the couple times I could've had sex I couldn't get it up, or it took forever. Once in the worst case I even ended up crying over it in front her out of pure frustration. Yeah... embarrassing. I felt really broken, like one of my arms just mysteriously stopped working, so of course I went to my doctor. He took blood but told me I was likely just \"grieving my relationship\" and doing fine. Further proving this, the tests came back well within normal range for testosterone (in the upper 75% of the range). He gave me the number to a therapist and told me to go. \n\nThis was about 5-6 months ago. I haven't had time to go to the therapist due to scheduling conflicts, and to be honest I'm still not completely convinced there isn't anything physically wrong with me. Like, by now shouldn't I be over it? We broke up almost a year ago (February, just before Valentine's) and I don't think of her everyday anymore... I don't feel anywhere near as lonely. My heart seems to be healing, but the problem persists. \n\nI can still get an erection on my own, as in, if I tried to masturbate right now I could easily do it to completion, but the erection itself is very weak and the orgasm sucks. I feel small. Porn helped, but I realized I probably didn't want to develop a dependence on that so I stopped watching it entirely. I recognize attractive women in real life, but I still feel like that \"spark\" is missing in me. I don't feel it the way I used to.  \n\nSome other notes:\n\n\\-I'm 31.\n\n\\-I work out, lift heavy weights (powerlifting) regularly, 4x per week. My diet is super clean, I'm careful to get enough protein and healthy fats and I do track everything.\n\n\\-I'm extremely busy most of the time. I am a full time student and full time employee at a busy hospital pharmacy. Don't ask me how I'm able to do this, I barely know myself. I usually work 7 days on, 7 days off. I focus on only taking care of myself and working out during my work week, and then catch up on school things during my week off. It's very, very stressful, and I'm always broke to pay for tuition. I work overnights 9pm-7am, so my sleep cycle is always in turmoil. \n\n\\-I don't watch porn anymore. \n\n\\-I still get \"morning wood\", but like with masturbating the erection is exceedingly weak. Can that really be caused by a psychological issue? \n\nI guess the only solution I have is just to finally go talk to a therapist, but it's not something I've ever done before. I can talk to anonymous people online, but I feel like it'd be really awkward to talk face to face with a person. Moreover, the therapist he gave me to go to is a woman... would she even be able to get where I'm coming from? And, could my problem REALLY BE ALL IN MY HEAD? I'm just not convinced...\n\nSorry for the long post, thanks for any advice.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"menshealth","subreddit_id":"t5_2qp1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/menshealth","subreddit_subscribers":8930,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I know this is a common topic, and no one here is a doctor (I've already seen mine), but I'm wondering if I can get some feedback on erection problems I've had recently (~the last year)?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/menshealth\/comments\/r61l8p\/i_know_this_is_a_common_topic_and_no_one_here_is\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

Only person who was ever like a mom to me (bio mom ditched me at six months) died in my arms in 2016 and my first child died in 2020 bc of a misscarriage and then the bd kicked me to the streets after having a misscarriage in his bathroom.

This is what she had told me I had slid to the ground like I didn't fall hard but definitely slid to the floor from a standing position, she then said I started seizing but it wasn't like she had seen before (she's certified and has training in this area) but she said it didn't even really look like an actual seizure I started shaking and my eyes where closed I then went unresponsive. My best friend had to YELL my name five times before I finally came back like she was like what do I do did this bitch literally die on my kitchen floor.

I've never gone to a GP about them but my symptoms are racing heart rate, hyperventilating, feeling terrified and completely unable to control the breathing. When it first happened, I thought I was dying but now I know the situation, I don't get that panic. I can stop the symptoms but it takes a while - maybe like 20 - 40 mins. This usually only happens after I've consumed alcohol, but not if I'm drunk. I used to think it just happened because I didn't like bug crowds and wasn't drunk so still didn't feel comfortable, but it's happened when I'm at home as well. There's only been a few times when I've felt panicky without alcohol - both times when I was on a really packed train. Ive always been shy and I get nervous meeting new people to the point where I avoid those situations, but I just thought that was me and also recently got diagnosed with ADHD so I just put it down to that, but what I think are panic attacks can happen when I'm alone, so that doesn't really add up. I was just wondering if anyone thinks this is something I should discuss with a GP.

Just wanted to pop in and share my story. When I was a teenager, I rode hunter\/jumper, family was way too broke for it so I worked for all of my lessons and only ever rode lesson horses even when competing and stuff like that. A few bad falls and an anxiety diagnosis later I stopped, it was clear I was never going to be a top competitor and money was tight and....yep, had to get out of it.\n\n  \nNow, I'm 23, making good money (not a flex just...horses are expensive), and the itch bit me again. Called around, finally found someone that would actually answer the phone, explained that I'm out of shape (200 lbs+) but I'm ready to ride again and just...want to be around horses again. Had my first lesson about a month ago and I've been riding 1-2 a week ever since.   \n\n\nI am in HEAVEN!!!   \n\n\nComing back to this sport that brought me so much joy as a child has been....life changing. I work as an artist so just being able to get out of the house and out in nature is....so fulfilling.  \n\n\nI'm not very good at anything yet but yesterday I cantered again for the first time. It felt like I was flying.   \n\n\nSo anyways, meet my lesson horse, Blue! Late 10s quarter horse, with wayyy more whoa than go but I love him to the moon and back.   \n\n\nIf anyone has any book or video recommendations, please please please let me know, I'm also so curious how you people look around for lease or sale horses and how you go about financing them haha, I make good money but....lord, the prices people are asking for these horses....it's a jungle out there. \n\nThanks yall!

A lot of deadlines are coming up in January and I felt pretty confident in being a political science major for awhile now.

I also though minoring in an environmental science, economics, sociology, or just something that would pair well for more career options in the future. I don't plan on becoming a legislator or anything like that, I have social anxiety so I don't think I could do a job that social.\n\nSpeaking of social anxiety, I don't want to limit myself because of it. I grew up in a rural area that had nothing around so I spend most the time inside. Recently I've been getting better and hoped College would help me with it even more.\n\nI've recently heard though many Poli Sci grads are miserable and didn't even get a job they wanted, and it was all a waste. I don't have many other interests in majors besides Environmental Studies\/Science, Anthropology, and Sociology. All of which (besides environmental sci) are even worse from what I've heard when it comes to getting a satisfying career in it.\n\nSo I guess what I'm asking is, is poli sci a huge mistake?

I prefer to find a woman that is also a homebody and does not currently have children, but wants them.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ForeverAloneDating","subreddit_id":"t5_2sdpe","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ForeverAloneDating","subreddit_subscribers":206016,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"34 [M4F] NJ\/PA\/NY (US) - Looking for my forever partner","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.6,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ForeverAloneDating\/comments\/r61vln\/34_m4f_njpany_us_looking_for_my_forever_partner\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I finished my associate's in IT last semester and I have taken as many business credits at my community college as I can before I transfer to my 4-year university. I'm taking a semester off starting in a few weeks before I transfer to pursue my bachelor's in accounting. In the meantime, I would like to get a job that will give me a solid income to help pay off some credit cards that I have. I have taken 2 introductory accounting classes a little less than a year ago but am afraid that I have forgotten the majority of the content. I know I shouldn't just jump into a bookkeeping job and have no idea what to do from the posts I have seen on this same topic. My question is what position can I pursue (if not bookkeeping) that can help me gain experience for my future accounting degree as well as where I can brush up on my skills online somewhere to relearn some of the stuff I have forgotten. \n\nI appreciate anyone who is willing to help me.

Thank you for everyone's suggestions so far and I've had the opportunity to visit some less travelled paths!\n\nI've been fortunate enough to be able to work remotely and have recently gotten the go ahead for remote working till end of 2022 at least! Thus, I got myself a camper van and decided to do one of that craziest thing I've been thinking of doing for a long time!\n\nI'm seeking to get out of my comfort zone and meet new people for safe and discreet fun!I am 5'6 in average shape. I am very much a city girl and\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n1. Please be clean and ddf! I take pride in my health and personal grooming so this is an absolute must for me.\n2. It would be a big bonus if you can host! (all I have is a tiny camper van filled with my personal possessions so it's not the most comfy!)\n3. Please drop me a message with some general stats and general location of yourself, and be willing to verify yourself as will I. (a non-face pic of yourself is another bonus but I always verify and like to know who I'm meeting before we actually meet out of safety)\n4. Please tell me more about yourself in general and sexually if you want to get my attention. As shallow as I sound, I'm not after boring.\n\nLast of all, I have no fixed destinations post-LA, so feel free to hit me up with any great routes as well as destination! I have till end of 2022 to complete this trip so I'm pretty much going wherever I feel like going (albeit slowly) and I'd be open to meeting people across the country if our schedule fits!\n\nThank you and have a lovely weekend!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"RandomActsOfBlowJob","subreddit_id":"t5_2tpfa","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/RandomActsOfBlowJob","subreddit_subscribers":493111,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"28 [F4M] #LosAngeles -Back in my CamperVan","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":3,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.96,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RandomActsOfBlowJob\/comments\/r622fn\/28_f4m_losangeles_back_in_my_campervan\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I have read all the rules but my head is a mess right now so please tell me if I missed something :) English is my second language, please ask if anything doesn't make sense! \n\nI've been depressed for the most part of the last 7 or so years. I've been dealing with chronic pain for almost 8. I'm not sure how related they are. I'm 20 now. I'm autistic. I used to self harm, but I quit around 6 years ago. \n\nI've met a few different therapists over the years, some have been better than others. Most of the time I'd feel a little bit better for a while after seeing a therapist regularly, so they considered me \"well enough\" to stop seeing me. But then I'd get worse again, and I'd see a therapist again, feel better, go home, feel worse, etc. I'm on a waiting list to see another therapist to get help dealing with a traumatic event that happened like three years ago now, but the wait lists are incredibly long because there's barely enough resources to go around, so right now I feel like I'm just in some sort of limbo. When I was evaluated for my autism about a year ago one of those doctors suggested I try antidepressants, based on the fact that therapy hasn't really helped me. \n\nMy regular doctor prescribed me cymbalta. I took it for like 9 months before I could finally convince her to let me stop taking it because I had awful side effects and felt no better. I think the thing that affected me the most is that I would have really horrible vivid nightmares, often several every night. In the end I was scared to sleep because of it. My doctor didn't really tell me anything about withdrawals. I have in hindsight learned that cymbalta is known for being hard to \"get rid of\", but she told me I could just stop taking my daily dose of 30mg and that was all she had to say. This was at the end of august and I haven't really functioned properly since. I saw a new doctor around three weeks ago and told her about my experience with cymbalta and about how I was really struggling with my mental health. She prescribed me escitalopram which I have been taking since then (so about three weeks) and I was really hoping that this medicine would work better but I am too depressed to get to school, I barely have the energy and motivation to shower every day (something that usually isn't an issue), and the nightmares are back. I know maybe it sounds silly, like \"oh no little baby had a bad dream?\" but I have never had dreams like these before starting antidepressants. They're so vivid. And some of them are so horrible that they stick with me for days, if not weeks. I feel like I wake up traumatized every morning. And I'm so tired and everything feels so heavy right now. I've missed so much school recently which is making me very stressed and anxious, but I just can't bring myself to go. I'm seeing someone tomorrow to talk about how the new meds are working. I feel like they're killing me. I'm honestly not sure why I'm struggling this much. I just feel so burned out. And I feel like the world wasn't made for me because life is so cold and harsh and unkind. I don't really want to die, but I still often wish that I would, because I just can't do this anymore. I truly feel like I'm in hell some days. My sister helps me a lot. I don't know what I'd do without her. But she has her own life. She can't spend all her time helping me with my problems.\n\nI'm not sure what I'm expecting from this post. But maybe someone has some advice. How to survive all the constant waiting. Doctors always tell me to wait. And then they go home after work and live their lives and think no more of me. But while I'm waiting, I lose years of my life. I've been either depressed or in pain or both during all of my teenage years. And assuming I don't die young I have to live for at least 50 more years. I don't think I can do that like this. It's too hard. I'm sorry, I'm rambling now. I'm going to try to sleep. I hope I can get a break from the nightmares.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"depression","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqqf","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/depression","subreddit_subscribers":876989,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Therapy doesn't help and antidepressants make me feel worse.

A couple of thoughts\/feelings I had\n\n1) Heard a lot of people say PM more difficult than AM. It should be noted that not everyone got the exam vignettes in the same order. I'm not sure if that applies to the exam as a whole or everyone gets the same sets in the AM and in the PM  but just different order. But something to consider. \n\n2) I found both sections to be of equal difficulty. I thought it was a fair exam - tricky but not like the CFA were trying to trick you....if that makes any sense. I don't think anyone can feel 100% comfortable on everything but nothing should surprise you hopefully. You may just get stumped on how best to answer it even if it's a topic you've covered a lot.\n\n3) Derivatives was as awful as anyone says it was. I got beat up on that section. I honestly feel that unless the CFA assign the same level of difficulty as I felt it was, that topic may sink me. But let's see.\n\n4) I made some dumb mistakes. Like some DUMB mistakes. Or just blanked at the worst time. But I'm trying to remind myself that I also knew a lot of questions as well. I'm trying to remind myself of the ones I DID get right before going down the dark hole that is all the questions I did NOT know.\n\n5) The MPS is indeed key here. I'm not sure I pass if it's 70. I've done the calculations predictions on how much I THINK I got and did my own scenario and sensitivity analysis because I don't have a life anymore and I barely get above 70 on the best case. But, again, let's see!\n\n6) I will definitely do it again if I fail. Now knowing what it's like in real time I would feel significantly more confident. This stuff is in your head - it's just different in real time. \n\n7) Quick feelings on topics. Think I did really well on Equities, CF, QM, and FI. Think Econ and FRA are wildcards - maybe my make or break. Can't really tell how I did on PM. Can't really tell on Ethics but can anyone? I'm cautiously optimistic though. Got crushed on DV. and maybe what hurts the most - I think I made some DUMB mistakes on Alts. I have a feeling that'll be my downfall.\n\nBest of luck to everyone. Hope the pass rate is 99.99% and the MPS is 20. And yes I'm 3 beers in.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"CFA","subreddit_id":"t5_2rzsx","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/CFA","subreddit_subscribers":92080,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Took LII Exam","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CFA\/comments\/r62ae9\/took_lii_exam\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I have some college credits (45)but no degree, I'm 31 years old. Prior to my current position I worked as a part specialist, but essentially an inventory controller\/purchaser for an oil rig moving company for 14 months until laid off due to covid.\n\nMy current title is Procurement Specialist for a small innovative company that sells product we manufacture in house. I've been here 9 months now, and currently I have been in charge of.\n\n-purchasing and receiving parts, office supplies, services etc. Drafting purchase orders w proper part numbers and pricing within SAGE accounting.\n-credit card reconciliation\n-inventory control, signouts, building BOMS within sage for new product, assigning part numbers to new components with the aid of engineering.\n-quartetly inventory counts and reconciliation\n-fixing already established bills of materials within SAGE\n-defining and documenting vendor management, inventory and procurement policies\n-I created a means of a weekly inventory report from exporting reports from SAGE into an excel workbookni created.\n\n\nThere are a handful of other tasks that come with the position, I'm the only procurement specialist here, the operations manager is my immediate superior.

It's definitely gotten better and I'm eating more, but still not as much as I probably should be. \n\nHowever, I am not here to ask how to start eating properly again. I think I've got a good handle on that, though any tips are always appreciated! I used to exercise a little before the medication. I'd go on a 10 mile bike ride once a week (occasionally a 25 mile ride), I'd play Ring Fit, or go hiking. Not a regular gym person, by any means, but I still got some exercise in. However, when I realized I wasn't eating as much, I stopped so that I wouldn't hurt myself from a lack of proper calories. Anyways, I was walking a brisk pace earlier today in order to keep up with a friend, and after our no more than 5 minute walk, I had a heart rate of 157 and was completely out of breath. \n\nMy question is ultimately how did you ease yourself back into exercise?

Occasionally I was also watching lesbian porn and solo women too. I got connected to a girl through the internet when I was 19 and she considered me as her best friend, I told her I am bisexual and started getting worried when she started dating a guy. I never met her in person as I had insecurities about my height... fast forwarding I got into “sissy hypnosis” “humiliation” “forced gay fetish” when I was 20 and started having body\/gender dysphoria. It also to do with my insecurities regarding my height. I had sex with a female hooker when I was 24, my first ever sexual experience. It was horrible, then tried with 2 more hookers, I got better but I thought they are a waste of money. Almost after a year I finally met a guy through Grindr. I used Grindr since I was 21 but finally build the courage to meet. I mentioned in my profile that I am submissive bottom. I met the guy, gave blowjob and returned, met a few more guys and had my first kiss with one of those guys, felt wonderful. Met 7 guys in a few months and i was never willing to do anything beyond foreplay and oral even though I wanted to bottom. I was identifying myself as gay... during that period I was interacting with a girl who was surprisingly interested in me... she was autistic too. I refused to have sex with her but we kissed, did oral, met her a few times and the friendship eventually broke. She was also having hookups with other guys and saying their penises were bigger... then later in 2020 I explored with 2 transwomen and a cis woman. I refused to fuck the cis woman but we did foreplay and oral, then I met another autistic girl with whom I started a relationship, we had multiple intercourses and whenever I came, I was thinking about penis and men (some of the hypnotic triggers by forced gay files). The relationship ended, then I explored again with a few men. Now I am talking to a girl who is also autistic, got so close and we are going to meet soon. Do you guys think I am bisexual or gay? I am so confused as 99% of the time when I climax, I think about penis and men.

I'd be explaining in detail about how I got into this bullshit and where I stand today at the age of 23. 13 years from my first leap down into the rabbit hole.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I first discovered porn when I was around 10 years old. At that time watching porn was hard for a child belonging to a 3rd world South Asian Country, not because of the lack of internet but also because of lack of private space and strict regulation from parents during pre-teens and teenage. But since my parents were separated and I lived with my mother and sister, I was always able to somehow get alone time where I could indulge myself in pictures of women in lingerie and swimsuits. I acted like a horny rabbit jacking off every time he got the chance to do it. During my adolescence I was called somewhat a genius in my family, due to my high memorisation and comprehension skills and good morals. As years went by, since during that time I had no relationship or knew I could not get a girl in anyway I just wasted my years jacking away till I was 14-15 years old. I used to do it once every couple of days and sometimes would pull off consecutive streaks of 4 or 5 days. I used to think that every child of my age used to masturbate to porn and just thought it was normal. \n\nAround this time I also started interacting with girls of opposite sex, and I did not have any issues with it. I was rather very over-confident and egotistical compared to most of the posts I have read on this sub reddit and never had any difficulty with socialising with people around me (I think this part of me came from my sociopathic and narcissistic personality that I somehow developed during my upbringing due to lack of heart filled affection and receiving high praises and expectations from my family and my porn addiction and masturbation only led to elevating these personality traits even further). During this time I started sexualising most girls I was friends with, I'd think of every girl I met as a prospect and would flirt with them or try to manipulate them into liking me. I had developed unrealistic beauty standards for the female gender, even though I would consider myself a 3.5\/10 now, but at that time I had a very high sense of self and thought I deserved all the attention I was receiving.  I also became friends with a girl kind of like myself (narcissistic and pervert) and I got into a sex chatting relationship with her. Also, during this time I dated a girl from my high school as well, I never actually told her how much addicted to porn I was and ended up lying to her throughout my relationship with her which lasted around 9 months. I was also in contact with my other sex chat-friend and never showed any signs of dropping it down. During my relationship I got heavily into porn, doing it every other day and getting into hardcore stuff such as gangbangs, threesomes, golden showers. I did not realise the trend was going towards a derogatory category towards women and just kept on going at it thinking it was normal.\n\nNow I am 17, out of a relationship, with an online friends with benefits and 100% scholarship at an A Levels College (Equivalent to a Senior Year in High school). I got more and more into girls, at one point most of the guys I knew started disliking because I only spent time with girls, and since my connection with all the females related to me was superficial since I could be real with anyone, I got more and more detached from human emotions and just started focusing more and more on sexual stuff and porn. Around this time an unfortunate, sweet, and a solid 10\/10 girl fell for my manipulation game and score, I got into another relationship. I lied to her about everything regarding myself, my porn habits my personality, my ambitions, acted as if I was very stable, genius who's going to achieve a lot. Meanwhile all I cared about was sexual with other girls and fapping at every chance I got. Since I was emotionally detached I did not properly love and from start focused on increasing my sexual tension with and we did go to places, she did everything she could possibility do to please me. And me the good little porn addict would do use her and then get right back to porn. I failed this relationship, she was a sexual assault victim already and I did nothing to understand her since I could not feel proper emotions and just focused on. the sexual parts of the relationship and got tired from it as well after some time and cheated on her with my sex chat friend since the vanilla stuff did not satisfy my sexual appetite and btw I'm still 17 here. During this time I was still heavily indulging into the ultra heavy hardcore categories of porn and never did it ever occur to me that something was wrong. Well, all in all we broke up, I drove her crazy and she left. I possessively stalked her for a couple of months, kind of blackmailed her into coming back to me and insulted and badmouthed her to other people in her and my life and just did whatever I could to ruin her social standing and succeed in it as well.\n\nFast forward, got a 100% scholarship again for college, left my country, travelled abroad with a very sexual mindset and thinking that I was a genius. Now having no parents watching over me, no relationship to tie me down I just let the porn addict in me loose. I started heavily indulging in it most of the time, I did built up a social life but due to my emotional detachment and narcissistic personality I ended up kind of ruining it, so I wanted connection as well but not just porn, I wanted more so I started first by talking to strangers online on hook up sites, but that did not work well since not many females use these places. So I PRETENDED TO BE ONE, I JACKED OFF TO TALKING TO GUYS LIKE A SLUT. AND THE BEST PART IS EVEN AT THAT TIME I DID NOT REALISE THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH ME. All my grades suffered a lot and I became an average student.\n\nSecond Year University, my ex girlfriend, the 10\/10 girl is back in my life and attending the same university. I started talked to her again, we hit off pretty well, since she never knew I was a porn addict or that I cheated on her, turned out her next boyfriend was very abusive and I again, as to the little shit I was, started manipulating her into being with me. She was very susceptible and I thought I could turn her into a proper slut to achieve my fantasies and that she would be perfect for me, and mind you this is me thinking about a sexual assault victim. We got together, she realised from the get go that I was emotionally detached and physically as well, I started having trouble getting hard normally and we always had to include different scenarios of her being a slut for strangers and getting gangbanged in our role plays to get me going. And the most unfortunate part is that she did everything I asked, meanwhile she herself was going through depression due to me being emotionally unavailable and her being in a relationship with a guy who did not properly love her. I dragged this facade of me loving her for the next 1.5 years. During this time I convinced her into creating a reddit account, and becoming an nsfw poster since I wanted her to be a slut. After the 1.5 years of our relationships she found out that I was into porn, and Lo behold I lied, I told her that it was something that I got into recently and I'll stop and promised to stop. And I promised that, the next 100 times she caught me lying to her regarding porn. During this time she did everything she could to get me off of porn, because she, unlike me actually loved me. She increased her post intensity, started making videos for me, started camchatting with guys online to get me off to the extent where I convinced her into fucking a random stranger off of reddit and boy did that stop me from watching porn? NO. This sweet girl that I ruined did everything she could to get me off this drug of an addiction and I did not get off of it still. İt came to the point she begged me to do whatever I want, as long as I don't lie to her because she can't deal with two things traumatizing her at once. I still lied to her, I ruined her by giving her trauma, insecurities regarding herself, anxiety regarding my loyalty and my porn addiction and have given her extreme depression, where she does not even have the energy to get off the bed due to me draining her completely.\n\nAnd here I am today, 3.5 years later into my second relationship with a 10\/10 girl with me being a 3.5\/10 with a diminished sexual drive, a pathetic ability to barely get an erection, and a person suffering from many skin issues as well. I am not the genius I once was either, did graduate on time but a lesser GPA, an average job, short term focus, bad memory. Very very bad memory. I literally forgot where I put my phone a fucking week ago, and I did not lose it outside since I fucking work remotely from home. Also with no friends and emotional connection and the only person with me is the person I have scarred for life. I not only ruined my life with porn but also of the one person in this world who truly ever cared for me even after knowing how filthy of a person I was.\n\nToday, she caught me lying again, for the 100th time and she still chose to stay. Even though I would keep lying to her everyday telling her \"I'm not lying to you.\" She still chose to give a pathetic person like me a chance and I came clean regarding everything that I was hiding from her. I told her I am still lying to her and everything I was lying about. She gave me a final chance, I hope, I really hope I make this one count.\n\nThis is why QUIT WHEN YOU CAN otherwise 13 years later you will regret it.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"NoFap","subreddit_id":"t5_2skrn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/NoFap","subreddit_subscribers":972200,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Why Quit when you can still Quit","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/NoFap\/comments\/r62z6b\/why_quit_when_you_can_still_quit\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}
