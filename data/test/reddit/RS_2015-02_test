I'm also looking at a Triumph Thunderbird Storm, and the Indian's cousins, Victory Gunner and Hammer. Don't want an air-cooled 'cycle, don't want a sportsbike, adventure, touring, cafe, or bagger.

Now, I'm 23-26 and you're 15-18. I've been home for the holidays, sleeping in my old bed, in my old room, right across the hall from yours. One night, you're out with your friends and mom and dad have left me alone. I'm leaving in a few days and they wanted a night out. I've been single for a few months and I'm craving sex. The first day I returned home, I was stunned by the beautiful young woman you had become; I left when you were 8 to go to college. Now you're tight body started driving me crazy the moment I saw you. I could barely hide the erection that was happening when you first welcomed me home with a hug. Tonight, I decide to check out your panties drawer and see what has been hidden behind your skirts and tight pants. You come home to see your door open and peek in. You see me. You start touching yourself under your skirt. It's wrong, but you're getting wet.\n\n2- I've seen you dancing in your underwear in your bedroom. My house is right beside yours and I can see straight through the windows because you never close the blinds. I've found myself aroused and touching myself when you walk from the shower to your bedroom. I swear you're just trying to tease a man who shouldn't be talking to you. My wife hates whenever you go in the backyard and sunbath in a bikini; I find it sexy as hell. One day, I see you changing in your room and see that you've stopped after putting on only panties and a tight shirt. I had been so encompassed by your booty shaking, that I didn't see that you were looking right at me.

{"selftext":"So I'd just played 3 hard fought online games, and just to get a few extra coins before bed, I decided to finish of my warm up/relax league (games I use to get coins whilst warming up for cup games/relaxing in between).\nI'm playing a shitey Serie B team and I have a rotated squad out. I start playing and I'm 3-0 up. Just as Xabi Alonso gets injured EA Servers time out . Bit of a pisser, but I've just avoided an injury so hey-ho. Not the worst thing.\nThe second time I'm 5-0 after 60 mins. My mum then comes in to tell me something, then gets distracted and starts dusting. Now I've had my PS3 since 2008 and my mum still has no idea about any of it. So guess what? She dusts the area that ejects the discs.\nI'm starting to get annoyed now. I go in for the third time lucky against this boring ass team and hope I can actually complete a fecking game.\nI won 5-2 (which I am ashamed of, and blame the constant distractions on), but here's the worst part. I got a bug that I've had before where one of the opposition players gets a second yellow, but the ref sends off your players instead - so Javi Martinez is suspended now, for another guy in a different shirt making a professional foul. This last part sounds like I'm making it up, but I swear to go I'm not. Xabi Alonso gets injured again. Fucking brilliant. So to sum up I've wasted 30 mins on a disappointing win and two of my players becoming unavailable.\nThis can't be karma - I'm not an arsehole on FIFA. I get frustrated at times, but I don't rage quit. I've never bought coins in my life and I'm not a sweaty guy. I don't have an average pace of 95 in my team and every player with 5 star skills.\nThe universe and EA seem to have collaborated against me.\nGood night.\n\nEdit: Thinking about it, I would have spent 36 mins playing games, but all the reloading, subs, team selection and celebrations and that would have made it closer to 40.","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1440933810,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/FIFA/comments/2ucxp0/the_most_frustrating_30_mins_of_my_fifa_career/","thumbnail":"default","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"The most frustrating 30 mins of my FIFA career","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1422750939","subreddit":"FIFA","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.FIFA","edited":1422751401,"score":0,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qxh7","created":1422750939,"from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/2ucxp0/the_most_frustrating_30_mins_of_my_fifa_career/","stickied":false,"from":null,"author":"[deleted]","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":0,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":"fut","name":"t3_2ucxp0","id":"2ucxp0","archived":true}

I'm not going to try to justify it, it's just the truth. I'm 28, my wife (Sarah) is 27, and Allison is 23. Sarah and I have been together for about 5 years, so I've watched this girl really grow up through college and now after. The two sisters have always been very close, which means that I get to hang out with Allison quite a bit. We do a lot together: go to dinner, movies, concerts, etc. I even took Allison to lunch a few weeks ago because we work near each other. We don't really flirt or anything and I'm sure she just sees me as almost like a big brother since she doesn't have a real one. I actually jokingly make fun of her a lot for all of her celebrity crushes and terrible taste in music, but we have a lot of fun. It's a nice relationship, but the crush that I've developed just won't go away.\n\n\nI've never acted on my feelings because I don't think that she feels the same way, and I don't want Sarah to kill me. My wife and I had a good relationship in the beginning, but these last few years have been really tough. We've grown apart, and I guess I've started to look for some excitement. I think I'm attracted to her sister because she's young, cute, and looks a lot like my wife, but she has a similar personality to mine. Basically, she's what I wish Sarah was like, and I feel terrible saying that.\n\n\nI've never officially cheated on my wife, but I've talked to several girls online and I've come very close to meeting one of them. They're not what I really want, though. I want Allison, but obviously I can't have her. She also has a boyfriend that she's been with since her senior year of college, so like 2 years now. He's a nice guy, but I don't think anyone, including Allison, sees it going anywhere.\n\n\nSo sometimes I'll get some liquid courage and decide to do something stupid. Like post on craiglist under the \"Missed Connections\" section and basically say that I wish I could have my wife's sister. Of course, no one ever responds and it's just fun to think about what would happen if she did write back.\n\n\nThat pretty much brings you up to speed. So last night, I came back from a nice dinner with Sarah where I had maybe a few too many drinks. She immediately headed to bed, but I stayed up to play around on the computer. I got online and went to craigslist, where I started to browse the \"Casual Encounters\" section and sent a few messages to girls. I know, I'm terrible. Sorry. Anyway, the girls on there almost never respond, but I figured I'd take a shot. One wrote me back right away, obvious spam. No one else wrote me back, so I just went to bed. But this morning, another girl replied who clearly wasn't spam. She was nice, flirty, and said she just wanted to have some fun with a guy. She had a long term boyfriend and didn't want anyone in \"real life\" to find out that she was cheating on him, so she wasn't going to go on Tinder or anything. We sent a few messages back and forth and it was fun talking to her. She was funny, clearly loved sex, and could actually put a sentence together, which is fairly unusual for craigslist. She and I did not exchange pictures since she didn't want to run into her boyfriend or anyone she knew and didn't want a bunch of guys to have her picture. I didn't mention that I was married, but there was no way she was getting a picture until I'd vetted her a little more.\n\n\nSo we sent a few more messages back and forth throughout the day today. You can probably guess what we talked about. We described ourselves, talked about sex, she told me how many dick pics she'd gotten from guys after posting the craiglsit ad, etc. I got her to send me an email from her \"real\" email address instead of the craigslist one, but it was obviously a throwaway email account (as was mine). After maybe 15 messages back and forth, I decided that I needed to see what this girl looked like. So tonight I asked her to send just one face pic so I could send one to her. And guess who it is...?\n\n\nMy wife's little sister, Allison.\n\n\nAt first I thought that someone had actually taken her picture from Facebook or something, but I looked again and it was just a typical selfie that I'd never seen on her profile. I downloaded it onto my computer and checked the photo details. She took it at 6:30 this evening and sent it to me 10 minutes later. It was really her.\n\n\nI was floored. Excited at first, but then I got scared. Scared that she would find out it was me on the other end and tell my wife. Scared that I would keep talking to her and eventually tell her that it was me like an idiot. Scared that I would tell her and she would tell me that she has the same feelings. Scared that we would actually act on those feelings.\n\n\nJust. Plain. Scared.\n\n\nAnd pissed! Just my luck. I start talking to a hot girl who's down for some fun, but now it turns out that there's almost no chance that I'll ever be able to meet her.\n\n\nBut...also excited. I mean, that's hot, right? What are the odds? We live in a fairly large city on the East Coast, so I can't even calculate how many people browse craigslist here.\n\n\nSo now I'm sitting here, unsure of how to proceed. I obviously can't just send her a pic of myself, since she'll just freak out. I can probably avoid sending a picture for a bit, but eventually she's going to want one of me.\n\n\nFucking craigslist.\n\n\n**TLDR: Tried using craigslist to cheat on my wife, ended up accidentally talking to her hot sister.**\n\n\n**EDIT 1**: Ok, well I think I've been able to hold her off for now. After thinking about what to say, I just messaged Allison back saying that I thought she was really cute and thanking her for the picture. Then I admitted that I was in a relationship with someone and was still too nervous to send a picture right now. I said that if that's a dealbreaker for her, I would understand, but I really wanted to keep talking. We'll see how that goes!\n\n\n\n**EDIT 2**: She wrote back! She said it's cool that I didn't send a pic, but now she regrets sending one to me. But she says she's less nervous now that I'm not her boyfriend or someone she knows because no one has texted her or anything saying it was them.\n\n\nSo I just wrote back and flirted a little more, nothing special, and asked her more about her job, what she likes to do, etc. I don't know how long I can drag that out, though. She posted on craigslist for a reason, and it wasn't to chat with a faceless internet guy...\n\n\n**EDIT 3**: Well, more confirmation that it's my wife's little sister. She signed her last email \"Allison\" and told me what she does for a living, which is exactly what my wife's sister does. Oh, and she asked me for my name. I'm going to give her my real first name. It's a relatively common name, so I won't be too shocked if she doesn't automatically assume it's me. We'll see...\n\n\n**EDIT 4**: She didn't figure it out. She just said, \"Hi, nice to meet you!\"\n\n\nShe somehow hasn't ditched me yet and I have no idea why. She said she's gotten rid of all of the other guys that she was talking to because they didn't meet her standards. I assume that means that most of them are idiots, because I'm sure she got like 100 dick pics of guys begging to have sex with her.\n\n\nShe wants me to send her a pic now, though. She did wink in her last email and say that it didn't have to be of my face, though. So I'm either going to send her a fake pic, a dick pic, a pic where you can't really tell that it's me, or a real one of me. I'm not sure. Help!\n\n\n**EDIT 5**: I sent her a dick pic. She just responded with a wink.\n\n\n**EDIT 6**: OMG. SHE SENT ME A NUDE SELFIE.\n\n\nLike...not just her tits or something. No. Her whole body with face smiling in her bathroom mirror. Jesus. Christ.\n\n\nI looked at the photo details and she did NOT take this one today. She took it on CHRISTMAS DAY AT 11:30 AM!! For the record, her parents, my wife, and I were all downstairs watching TV when she was taking that picture, either for another random guy or for her boyfriend. This is unreal. I actually sort of remember her saying something abou wanting to take a shower after we exchanged gifts that day. TIL my sister-in-law is a little slutty.\n\n\nI sent her another dick pic, but there are only so many of those to send.\n\n\n**EDIT 7**: Sorry for the delay. Allison and I have been chatting on KIK for like an hour.\n\n\nAnd just to be a sneaky bastard, I texted Allison as myself from my phone just to tell her about some stupid inside joke that we have about Taylor Swift because I just saw something about her online. She just texted back: LOL\n\n\nI'm terrible.\n\n\nAnyway I'm going to have to take a break for a bit. I've been on my phone for awhile now and I don't want my wife to get suspicious. If she only knew!!\n\n\nI promise that I won't be gone for too long! Maybe I'll have to \"go to the bathroom\" in a little bit, so I'll be able to update.\n\n\nI told Allison that I was going to go, but that I'd send her a face pic when I got back on later.\n\n\n**EDIT 8**: I'm back. The wife just went upstairs to go to bed, and I'm on the couch in the living room. I just got back on KIK and am talking to Allison again.\n\n\nI just went into my downstairs bathroom and took a nude selfie from the neck down. I figured, fuck it. She's been in that bathroom probably 20 times, so if she's going to recognize it, I figure she'll say something immediately. I just emailed it to her...\n\nOh, and to everyone saying that I'm a terrible person on here and in PMs? I know. I'm talking about trying to cheat on my wife with her own sister. I'm aware of how terrible that is. Again, this is TIFU, not \"I'm an awesome person\"\n\n\n**EDIT 9**: GOOD LORD. SHE JUST EMAILED ME ANOTHER NUDE PIC!!!\n\n\nChecked the photo details again, and this time she literally just took it like 4 minutes ago.\n\n\nIn this one, she's laying in her bed in just a pink thong. It's beautiful. I forgot to say what Allison looks like. She's 23, 5'8\", maybe 125lbs, blonde, blue eyes, very tone. Her face is very cute. She's not a supermodel or anything, but like girl-next-door cute. It looks like she's about a 34B, which is definitely smaller than my wife. Allison's are much perkier, though. And she's completely shaved except for a very thin little landing strip.\n\n\nSee why I have a crush?\n\n\nAnyway, either she's just messing with me now, or she really has no idea who I am. She responded to the bathroom selfie (without my face) by saying how hot my body was and how she wishes she was here right now. I looked at the pic again, and I guess it really does just look like a typical bathroom, so it's possible that she has no idea that it's me. She asked me for a face pic, though. I'm seriously considering it now.\n\n\n**EDIT 10**: Ok, I've decided to send her a face pic. I'm sure everyone here has their own opinion about that, but whatever. I think she knows it's me because of how she's acting. I can't really explain it, but it feels like she's making little subtle references to things we joke about. Like for instance, we were just talking about chicken fingers with ranch. She eats that all the time, and I always make fun of her about it. I know that sounds kind of stupid, but I always joke that it's like she's a little kid even though she's 23.\n\n\nJust emailed her a legit selfie. We'll see! Fingers crossed!!!\n\n\n**EDIT 11: OMG!!! THIS WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA!!!**\n\n\n**EDIT 12**: Sorry for taking so long to update this. I'm actually waiting for the shit to really hit the fan.\n\n\nAllison saw the pic and freaked out. I guess she really had no idea it was me the whole time. She called me and flipped out on me, basically telling me she was going to tell my wife and all that. She's embarrassed about the pics and told me to delete them. She hasn't called my wife yet, but she said she's going to soon. I guess this was a bad idea after all, so those of you who said that, you were right!\n\n\n**EDIT 13**: So Allison called and woke up my wife. This is a fucking disaster. My wife talked to her for a while and then she screamed at me for like 20 minutes. I had nothing to say in return, since everything she said was 100% true. She just left and went to her parents house. This is so much fun.\n\n\nSo I just broke the seal on a bottle of 18 year old scotch. That's what I'll be doing for the rest of the night. Well, that and talking to all you wonderful people.\n\n\n**EDIT 14**: Sarah just called and screamed at me for a few minutes. It was quite unpleasant. She didn't say anything about a divorce, but who knows what's gonna happen. Allison is apparently mortified. The only card that I hold is I know that Allison was going to cheat on her boyfriend, but who even cares anymore?\n\n\nOh, and I think it's hilarious that every one of my comments is being downvoted. You people do realize that this is a throwaway and I could not care less about fake internet points, right?","media":null,"name":"t3_2ucy8f","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"archived":true,"id":"2ucy8f","num_comments":98,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"[deleted]","stickied":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2ucy8f/tifu_by_having_a_crush_on_my_sisterinlaw/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2to41","created":1422751226,"from_kind":null,"score":47,"edited":1422775107,"quarantine":false}

I've had my times with painkillers and a few experiences with benzos, coke, amphetamines and of course the almighty psychedelics.\n\nLate 2013 is when I got really interested in psychedelic drugs, for several reasons. My psych list includes, DPH, DXM, Shrooms, LSA, and LSD. Of course you could classify some as sub genres such as dissociatives and deliriants but they all have hallucinogenic effects. I've probably dosed DXM anywhere from 50-100 times within the last year..My highest dose was at about 2000mg and was a NDE. My LSA trip was probably around 700 morning glory seeds, and my LSD trip was 2 tabs. What I'm getting at is I've had my experience with feeling altered, my mind playing games and being completely out of this world. I've experienced head highs, complete hallucinations, OEVs and CEVs.\n\nRecently I've picked up smoking again and now, after all of my psych experiences, I have something to compare to, and I find it to be somewhat similar.  I've never really thought of this, because for some reason I thought everyone felt relatively the same effects, but as I have come to ask friends how they feel.. My high is totally different. \n\nI just want to describe how I feel after I smoke, usually every time or close to. It feels like my brain processes things much slower, or that time itself is in slow motion. Everything. When people have conversations I pay attention to the amount of time between when one persons sentence ends,  and the other begins. It feels like minutes have passed, but in reality, it's a normal conversation. I think of situations differently, I feel more involved with everything around me. When I watch TV, I get sucked in and i feel connected to the characters and the whole story that's going on and my emotions feel amplified. There's periods of time during my high, I will completely ignore whatever is going on around me and have complete conversations in my head, like I'm analyzing something, or acting out situations. Like last night, I was watching the TV show Friends, looking at the screen the whole time, but thinking about \"What ifs\" in my head.. I missed half the episode. My senses are shifted, hearing things don't sound \"normal\" it's seems better, like when you change the quality on youtube from 360p to 1080p. My vision seems that everything is so sharp and I look at everyday objects in awe or actually think about why it's there or why I have it. There was a period where the TV was paused and I was just staring at the picture, zoning out. The man on the screen looked like I could make a RoboCop cartoon out of the shapes, so the next 15 minutes I was picturing and imagining drawing out this robocop charater, but too damn high to get up and get my sketch book. There's times I go through numbing thoughts such as \"What's the point of life?, Why work to live, live to work, why have kids to do the same thing?\" The thought of importance of money and how insignificant it really is in the universe, but so important to man-kind.. Very comparable to my Acid trip, but with pot, it's controllable and doesn't have a \"bad trip\" feeling, like the anxiety or panic attack from LSD or LSA\n\nPeople always say that smoking makes them calm and collect, relieves anxiety or makes them outgoing.. My case is completely different. Instead of getting a high, its like a mini mental trip with visual and auditory distortions.\n\nWhen I think of \"Getting high\" I think of feeling floaty and euphoric, something like some opiates, but pot seems to be closer to the feelings of psychedelics than to anything else for me\n\nDoes anyone else have similar experiences?\nHow do you guys feel after smoking some bud?","media":null,"ups":2,"retrieved_on":1440933788,"link_flair_text":"[Cannabis]","permalink":"/r/Drugs/comments/2uczbw/marijuana_as_a_psych/"}

I'm 16 right now, 17 pretty soon. I've gone through so many different phases of life and strange experiences. There's all of these people around me who I witness do and say terrible things, live with closed minds, drop out of highschool, develop horrible drug addictions, etc. I've been trained my entire life to trust everything adults say because I'm young, but as I get older I find myself having trouble trusting them as I notice more and more older people saying more and more morally and intellectually illogical things,\nyet they insist they're *never wrong.*  All it does is create frustration and anger. \n\nI've also had a lot of problems growing up.

{"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1440933768,"selftext":"I\u2019ve had a fantasy lately, and I would love someone to play it out with. If you like it let me know. \n\nHere it is:\n\nI meet a nice, cute, younger woman somewhere, (perhaps we can go with a stereotypical meet at a bar, or perhaps we met online, or I saw you in a grocery and decided to take a chance, I am open to ideas) we end up chatting and hit it off. However, she is way out of my league, I know it, I\u2019m pretty sure she knows it as well, so I have no clue why she would be interested in me. However, she does seem genuinely interested in me. We agree to go on a date, somehow, I even manage to get an invitation back to her place. \n\nShe explains to me that she has a place that her parents pay for, so she has the place all to herself. It is here that I start to understand that she (well, at least her family) is pretty well off. She explains, because of her family\u2019s status, she\u2019s never quick to bring anyone home, but she can see something special in me. I jump at the opportunity, of course! She insists on picking me up, and does so the next afternoon in a sporty car. After a quick drive out into a rural area she pulls up to a gated home. It\u2019s a large, single level home. Because of its location it is very private.  \n\nAfter entering the home we chat a little bit, but I can tell there has been a change in dynamic. Where she had been sweet and unassuming before, she is now becoming aggressive, and a little domineering. Before long she invites me into her what I assume is her bed room. But, as the lights flick on I see that I am very wrong, she has a full dungeon at her disposal. And she tells me she plans on using it all on me. There I am used as her toy, I am whipped, beaten, humiliated, fucked by her strap on and shown what it takes for guys like me to get women like her. By the end of it, I love it. She may or may not let me cum, but wither way I am under her spell and I just want more. If I\u2019m really lucky she may decide to keep me, or maybe I\u2019ll just be tossed aside like so many men before.\n\nI hope you like my idea. Much of the details are open for your interpretation, but that is the overall theme I wanted to go for. A little about me: I am 33, bi, 5\u20199\u201d, a little on the chubby side, with brown hair and green eyes. I am open to pretty much anything, as long as it doesn\u2019t involve scat, diapers, vomit, smoking, animals, kids (under 17), mutilation, gore and snuff, I should be good to go, just ask.\n\nI hope to hear from you ladies!\n","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2ud0w1/33_m4ft_the_trap/","title":"33 M4F/T The Trap","secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"nsfw","distinguished":null,"domain":"self.dirtypenpals","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1422752693","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","score":1,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2ud0w1/33_m4ft_the_trap/","created":1422752693,"subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","from_kind":null,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"MyKinkyTA","name":"t3_2ud0w1","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"archived":true,"id":"2ud0w1","num_comments":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":true}

Over the years I have started standing up for myself more when we fight which ends up making the arguments worse. Don't get me wrong, we don't fight every day. I would say on average our arguments escalate about 1-2 times monthly. She is very condescending on a regular basis. When I bring this to her attention she says she is not. It's all in her tone of voice. My wife always takes the defensive side when asked a question. I'm almost afraid to ask anything anymore. In the past I've made comments about getting on an anti-depressant. She tried Wellbutrin but did not do anything for her mood. What really pisses her off is that her family takes my side if they witness an argument. Once, her cousin pulled me aside and said \"don't take this the wrong way but is **** hard to live with?\" I replied with \"Let me put it this way.. I make my decisions based on whether I'll get yelled at, not what I think is wrong or right.\" One of our biggest arguments is about sex. On average we have sex once every 3 months which really pisses me off. She has no explanation for it other than \"I really couldn't care less about sex. Why is sex all that men think about? Why do you need sex so bad?\" I've tried explaining to her that it is a way to show love, for couples to bond, etc. The way I feel now is that we are roommates who hook up every few months. I know she masturbates regularly which is okay with me since I do as well but the other night she did it while I was on the computer for work. She went to the bedroom; for what I had no idea and she came out 10 minutes later. The only reason I knew this is because the wires to her vibrator were sticking out of the drawer where she keeps it. They weren't sticking out when I went into the bedroom to use the master bathroom just a little earlier. Aside from just sex I've been making an effort to kiss more; to put my arm around her waist for no reason, to hold hands. The other night I rented a movie for us to watch and I wanted to snuggle on the couch so I could give her a foot massage and stroke her hair. Didn't even think about asking for sex that night..just wanted to be close to her. She wanted to watch the movie in bed because her neck hurt. I said that was fine but no phone. Just want to spend quality time together (she loves to play games on her iphone, facebook, etc). She said \"I want to play words with friends with my mom..we play every night.\" I said that was fine but no social networking. We ended up holding hands for 10 minutes only. I looked over at her phone about 1/2 way through the movie and she was on facebook. WTF? To spare an argument, I didn't even say anything. I forgot to mention that I suffer from anxiety and didn't wasn't in the mood to flare that up. What really prompted me to post on this sub was that I was driving to work the other day and I thought.. \"man I'm 35..is this where I really want to be for the rest of my life?\" I've thought about divorce before but the thought of not seeing my kids every day would absolutely kill me. We do get along well enough where it does not effect the kids. Arguments in front of the children are extremely rare. So, with all this being said, what advice do you have to help me rekindle our physical and emotional relationship? Sorry if this post doesn't flow very well....she is sitting on the other side of the room and we're about to run to Walmart. I had to post this fast! lol ","media":null,"ups":11,"retrieved_on":1440933762,"created_utc":"1422752925","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"relationship_advice","domain":"self.relationship_advice","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"I [35/m] haven't been happy with my wife [33/f] for quite some time now","secure_media_embed":{}}

I absolutely hate this guy, he's asked me about my personal life,  asking where my father lives (who is exmo and divorced with my mother), and really just tries to pry into my personal life that has ZERO to do with him. He asked for me to call him back  for what I'm assuming is setting up a regular home teaching schedule. I feel like I can't go teach about this bullshit let alone accompany someone like him. I dont know what to tell him except yes, if I say no I'm guessing he'll try and pry into my life even more and ask for a reason, it's not like I can just tell him I don't believe in it. Help?

I'm 22 years old and in my 4th year at college. I would type out my whole life story but I've talked about it more this week then I have in the past 4 years.\n\nMy father is the narcissist and my mother is the enabler. They are both drug addicts. My Nfather's abuse began when I was only 11 and has never subsided. The problem for me has always been that the abuse was only verbal. He never hit me which is something I grew to resent for a long time because words don't leave bruises and maybe my mother would have realized the damage he was causing if it had been physical instead of mental. This message is for everyone who has ever suffered at the abuse of an Nparent and the neglect of an Eparent.\n\nThe pain and emotions you feel are real. The abuse is real. Everything you are feeling and are going through is not okay and cannot be justified by your parents. But things will get better. You have no obligation to them. You owe them nothing. \n\nI \"divorced\" my parents the minute I graduated high school. I have done the past 4 years of university on my own. I have been NC with my father since then and am currently LC with my mother. I have 2 jobs, 5 classes, 2 goldfish, 1 cat and the most passionate, caring fiance a girl could ask for. And now I have a therapist. \n\nI would like to encourage everyone in this sub to find their own happiness and not get caught up in the ridiculous social expectation regarding family and blood. Surround yourself with people who make you happy and love the people who truly love you back. Do not be afraid to seek out help to deal with the emotional problems that arise from living with Ns and Es. Your feelings are valid. Your anger is justified. And people are out there who would love to help you deal with these problems no matter how small you might think they are.\n\nThank you /r/raisedbynarcissists for helping me take the next step and seek help.

This post isn't about sympathy, its about my life and what its becoming. I've spent over 3 years shortly 4 with a girlfriend who I've totally fallen in love with, you know all Disney film style constantly on my mind butterflies the lot, but quickly I realized something was admits lurking in the back of this relationship compared to my other relationships there was a apparent lack of sex right from the start we started off with sex once a week, Great sex, Many orgasms and laying chatting about anything until we fallen to sleep then it slowly slipping into once a month. Now when I was younger, younger being 17-18 I thought once a month was totally unacceptable a unreasonable lack of sex so much in fact I ended up leaving the girl I was with mainly because of that ( also she wasn\u2019t really a nice person ) and now. once a month seems like a distance memory, 2014 I could count the times I had sex on my hands. But on the bright side I still needed two hands. But before I get the torrent of \"leave her\" \"she's cheating\" all that jazz, please understand there is two sides to every story. and her side has problems. strongest of which is in fact she suffers with pains after sex and fears them as these pains interrupt her life, and orgasms actually cause bleeding too for her usually and she's been checked and no idea bla bla,\n\nWhich points me in one standard position. A sexually frustrated trapped male with this title I've also noticed a few problems. First of which is obvious the idea of a affair, I don\u2019t mean to blow my own horn (I really wish I could blow my own horn at times) .. second thought I don\u2019t actually. but I'm not a bad looking guy, and I know with some degree of certainty I could get another decent girlfriend within 4 - 5 months But here's the problem I'm almost 27. and I have strict views on sex and relationships I'm not sure I could live with myself if I've had a affair, and also I'm pretty damn happy with who my girlfriend is ? She's beautiful adorable understanding caring she's literally my princess, I'm guessing Cinderella didn't put out either. and on top of all this why on earth would I look for some one who is more compatible for me when I'm 26 when I'm convinced I've found it. So I'm here. stuck. waiting. for that lovely surprise that is intercourse but for now my life is filled with passionate solo masturbation, closing my eyes and just envisioning a normal sex life until I climax, then opening them and discovering I don\u2019t have that and also a mess to clean.\n\nLife with out sex seems so much harder there is no blissful escape of a passionate moment after a long day of working or studying there is no instant relief that comes with a serious 20-30 minute fucking, and there is no comforting little lift of the warmth of some one who desires you sexually at the end of the night, I actually feel heavier dragging slumping ogre like, also with a overwhelming sense of emptiness some days, hollow like a husk, even right now I have a blank expression on my face whilst typing this while I feel some men at this point might be cry wanking into the keyboard with this confession, but the sad fact is I'm numb I've been crippled shot down drained rejected emptied of any feeling after chasing for sex for 3 years and now I've come to the bitter conclusion after all these years of lack of sex that I'm not half the man I used to be sex made me more confident in my life but I no longer have that boost. The reason for this whole message is I want to know I'm not alone I want to know If staying on this path is the right track, Or if I'm making a horrible mistake.","permalink":"/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/2ud2sp/my_sexless_life_now/","link_flair_text":null,"title":"My sexless life now","secure_media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","domain":"self.DeadBedrooms","hide_score":false,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"DeadBedrooms","created_utc":"1422753695","author_flair_text":null}

Sorry in advance for typos and grammatical errors. \n\nWe got married very young, I was 19 he was 22. We were together for about two years prior to getting married. He's 30 and I'm 27 now. For the first 5/6 years, I was in college and he worked odd hours. We had plenty of time together and plenty apart. About 2 1/2 years ago he started working a 9-5 type job and I graduated college. We now have the exact same schedule and spend every night/weekend together. \n\nWe both have social anxiety issues and don't have much of a social life. I'm not blaming him, but I am a go with the flow type person and his flow has always been to stay home. I've always had social problems, but being home so much over the years magnified it. Although I was in college, I didn't have the typical college experience and missed things that most young adults do (dating, parting, living on your own, etc.). About a year and half ago I started therapy for my social anxiety and have really turned myself into a more social person. He's remains much of the same and I struggle with the lack of a social life, for myself and us as a couple. He's such a home body and has little interest to do anything outside of watching TV or playing music. I've tried to expand on what we do, but I find it difficult to always come up with ideas.\n\nLast summer I started online gaming and have met many new people. It has been a nice balance of socializing more, but not straying too far from my comfort zone. Last fall I met someone online who immediately caught my attention. Over a month or so our friendship grew, and we took things offline on to e-mailing and texting. \n\nAround the same time I was getting really fed up with my SO, I wanted and need some space and some control over my life. We spent so much time together I was feeling suffocated. We did everything together, from going to bed at the same time to grocery shopping. I started staying up late gaming, going for long walks and just taking time away from us. The more I did it, the more I wanted it. Meanwhile, I was continuing to develop feelings for my AP. We'd text every day, all day. About a month into this after one very petty fight, he left the house and I packed up some of my stuff and left.\n\nOver the next month and a half, I saw my SO a couple times a week on dates and in couples counseling. The time we spent together was really fantastic. It was like we were dating. I had my time, space, socialization with friends, time to exist as an adult by myself and then we had our time together. Our sex life was amazing as well. We connected so much more during sex, it was fantastic. During this time, I was continuing to text and skype my AP. We'd share photos, videos, etc with one another regularly. Over the course of four months we exchanged nearly 10k text messages and about 1k photos/videos. I got such a charge knowing that he was so interested in me. I felt wanted and needed.\n\nIn early November, through the advice of my therapist, I moved back home. I tried to break it off with my AP at that time, putting everything I had back into my marriage. This lasted about two weeks. I desperately wanted to continue my relationship with my AP. We started texting again in early December, but he broke it off again around Christmas when completely stopped texting all together. \n\nMy marriage for the first month or so that I was back was better. We spent more time doing our own thing which resulted in the time together being more meaningful. In mid-December things started to go down hill again. He felt I was spending too much time gaming and not enough time with him. I truly found enjoyment in interacting with other people online, but he felt like I would rather do that than spend time with him. \n\nFast forward a month, I continue to game online our marriage is in the garbage and I have no desire to fix it. He's incredibly frustrated by the amount of time I'm online and sees it as excessive. He has no idea about the AP. He doesn't like that I talk to other men, and thinks I would prefer to spend time with them. At this point, I would rather be with other people interacting in some way then sitting on the couch watching a movie. I love him, I really do, but I don't know if I want to be married anymore. I want to be with other people. I want to experience life as an adult outside of marriage. I don't feel bad for straying from our marriage and I was happiest when we were apart. If my AP texted me right now, I'd be over the moon. It was the best of both worlds. I missed my SO at times while I was away, but generally was fine with the living situation. I feel guilty for not feeling worse about things. I just don't know where to go from here. I'm not happy.\n\nEdit: Update\n\nI'm not sure were at the door yet for a divorce, but certainly that's where we are heading if things don't change. \n\nWe had an interesting session with our marriage counselor/my therapist (one in the same) yesterday. She seems to think I'm depressed, thus I get no enjoyment/happiness from things. Gaming is my release and distraction from everything else that is going on. I can't say I entirely disagree, but I think most of that stems from my AP leaving suddenly, but it's not like I can/would bring that up. She wants me to see a psychologist.\n\nWe got our phone bill yesterday, I saw a huge spike in the number of texts my husband sent in December. From ~200 to nearly 1,000. I asked him what was up and he said he has been texting a female work colleague. He's been confiding in her for support on what we're going through, shes about 10 years older and apparently has been through it. A I haven't been there, so he's needed someone to talk to. I can understand the need to talk to someone who is close by and easy to confide in. I don't really feel hurt by it. To my knowledge he has never cheated, but then again, neither had I. I'm not really sure how to digest this new information. My gut reaction is to trust him, but I don't want to be naive about it either. ","retrieved_on":1440933703,"ups":2}

The first two or three days on meds were great, even though I only felt euphoria on the first day haha.

I don't know much about reddit, but I know you guys listen and actually respond, and I need that right now. This is the first time I have ever put my feelings on the line, I'v never attempted suicide before, but I have considered it... a lot. I am currently considering ending my life, I have a gun by my bedside, and I think I might use it. Sobeen diagnosed with depression before but I don't quite think that is it. I just see life as a rat race, I get bored, I'm not sad...just...indifferent.I'm going to tell you my life story now, as this might be my last words to...well...anyone. I am 17 years old, I'm not a notable individual, I've never done anything worth mentioning. I was born to a mother who cares about me immensely, but knows nothing about me, and a father who supposedly molested me when I was 3(I do not remember the incident and cannot attest to the fact) my mother shortly moved out with me in tow, I have not seen him to this day. I have no reason to be depressed, I've never been abused, I've never had a traumatic event happen in my life. When I began school I had no friends and I was nearly mute, I preferred to observe than to speak and was very bright for my age. I never played during recess because of my depth perception problems and instead stayed inside and read. I quickly surpassed my peers in reading. I had no friends until until 1st grade when I was put by an outgoing and intelligent kid(we will call him Jeff), Jeff soon became my only friend and would speak for me, I love him like a brother still to this day. When I entered 3rd grade I was diagnosed with ADD due to my disinterest in class work and I was also given an IQ test to see if I had a learning disability( I reportedly scored a 147) and I was put on Ritalin, my grades improved. By 4th grade I was reading at high school level and had surpassed my teachers in reading speed and refused to partake in outloud reading in class because it was \"too slow for me\" I now read at 1000+ wpm. I maintained a A average for the rest of Elementary (which isn't that impressive, most kids do). In 6th grade I was recommended to a counselor because I refused to do anything in class and had a disregard for authority and had frequent outbreaks of severe terror during thunderstorms.\u00a0 I told her that I saw no meaning in life, it was pointless and existed only for members of the human race to procreate. I was institutionalized for \"suicidal thoughts\" a couple days later. When I was in the hospital I saw kids who had anxiety issues, I saw kids who were suicidal and \"heard voices and talked to satan\". I was in the hospital for 4 weeks and was then released because they saw no reason to keep me any longer. Flash forward to middle school, I was bullied and a social outcast excluding Jeff who was popular and kept me around because he knew another side to me, he thought I was cool. My grades plummeted, I was nearly held back a grade if it weren't for my test scores(which were high). This went on until my junior year when I begged my mom to let me switch schools. Best decision I ever made, I have friends now, I'm semipopular, I'm not seen as weird or lame. For once in my life I'm cool, I even have a girlfriend now...but I still can't shake that darkness that is eating away at my soul. I have a GPA of 2.3 and I'm signed up for Navy Bootcamp as soon as I finish school. My life should be great...right? But I feel unfulfilled...I feel like it means nothing...I feel like suicide is the only rational option.

There is no cure for eczema. Many people know this and may wonder why I'm bothering to write this, but as a frequenter of this subreddit I get frustrated with people asking about cures for eczema. It just isn't a curable condition right now. That doesn't mean there isn't anything you can do to help but my problem is the mindset that comes with the word cure. \n\nI'm sure many of you have been given advice by someone who has a cousin who swears they tried this diet and their eczema went away for good. Or they used this cream and no more eczema. This doesn't help to be told and can be frustrating, but even more so, its damaging to believe a cure is out there. If you believe that eczema is something you can get rid if by resorting to magical cream A or amazing diet B then you are more likely to be complacent when you are not going through a flare up and that increases your risk of triggering it.\n\nThere are ways to minimise risk of triggers by changing diet, etc. Some are more effective than others and it is always different person to person. There are also effective ways to manage the symptoms which are less personal and general advice works for many people for this. These things are good to share with each other and I think its great that so many people do share here, its often moving and helpful to read these buts of advice and the stories around them.\n\nTo anyone in this subreddit asking about people who have cured their eczema. Some people \"grow out\" of it, others, like me, have to be prepared to live their entire life with it. It is much easier to assume you will have it forever. You will treat your akin better when its not flared up and will recover quicker because you will learn to act quickly and appropriately when you recognise symptoms. Please don't encourage bad habits in people by using the word cure. I know no harm is intended and its a language issue but it does matter.","domain":"self.eczema","hide_score":false,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"eczema","created_utc":"1422756471","author_flair_text":null,"title":"Can we talk about the word \"cure\" please?","secure_media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self"}

I'm 25 years old, 6' and I weigh 270 lbs.\n\nI started gaining weight after I injured my heel  last year and the added weight has made exercising impossible (at least how I used to do it when I weighed 225). To try and get back to feeling healthy I've been trying to stick close to 2100 to 2200 calories though i'm not perfect. My doctor told me that the only exercise I can do is very low impact because of my injury but was VERY vague on anything else about my decision to start working out. \n\nSo I decided on cycling. Two weeks ago I did 20 minutes, then 25 minutes and now I am doing 30 with a 2 minute cool down. I usually watch my heart rate and keep my hands on the monitor at all times to get a good idea of the average.\n\nThe numbers I get when at the peak of my workout (for calorie burning) are anywhere from 165-175. My average for the 30 minute session tonight was 162. I am not sure what my resting heart rate is but when I first put them on the monitor after stretching it usually reads about 110 which seems really really high to me.\n\nAm I working too hard? I wish my doctor had told me more but he basically ushered me out of the door and told me not to go running. He told me to keep stretching (which I always do) and last week I actually pulled a muscle in my lower back, YAY! So i took it easy last week.\n\nI usually, according to the machine, burn around 350 calories to 400(tonight woot) and keep my rpm at around 80. It's hard and tonight was the first time i managed to get through the entire 30 minutes without having to go down on my level from 10 to 8 (average of 4-5).\n\nAlso, I usually get a crampy, sore feeling on my left butt cheek too while i'm riding as if it is getting worked out more then the other. Is that normal? Always feels weird but I get past it. I assume its because the muscles hate me. I don't want to get injured.\n\n**TL;DR- Is 165 too high for an out of shape, 270lbs, 25 year old female.

I don't want to be physically forced, but more so mentally manipulated into it by an aggressive cocky guy.\n\nI like RPs that have a good deal of build up, character development, and realism to them; I don't want to go straight into the sex... it gets boring, FAST. That's one of the reasons I prefer to talk on yahoo messenger, it's a good way to keep the story going for longer periods of time (I've done some over the course of a couple months before)\n\nI usually prefer to play around my actual age, 22. I'm 5'4\", shoulder length kinda wavy dirty/dark blonde hair, bright blue eyes, 34D, girl next door/sporty girl mix (I ran in high school and played soccer). So, possible role ideas. Our relationship could be many different things... Neighbors, your babysitter, siblings, sibling's best friend or bully, and I'm open to many other ideas.\n\nNow, the interesting part... how you make me your personal slave... Overall, I'm looking for a setup that will awaken the deep desire inside me to submit to a man as he shows me he is the most important person in the world and needs to be obeyed (think Alpha male mentality) Here are some of my favorites, but if you have another idea, please don't hesitate to let me know.\n\nMy favorite idea is that the teen would be so cocky, controlling, and manipulative that it would slowly awaken a deep desire inside me to obey and he plays off that new found feeling. I'd like this to be a theme in any situation we play out, but it can also stand by itself.\n\nAnother option is we make some sort of bet that I end up losing. This starts the ball rolling towards my ultimate submission. But just because I lost a bet of some sorts doesn't mean I'll immediately drop to my knees and start blowing you... But it'll start pushing me in that direction. Maybe the loser has to be a servant for the winner; It starts with fetching drinks/food, then moves to massages, then more.\n\nA third idea, and this is as \"unrealistic\" as I like to go, is that you somehow brainwash me to make me more receptive to your advances and to accept your superiority. Maybe a drug, hypnosis, or subliminal messages in music you're playing... It wouldn't instantly make me a mindless slave, but slowly make me feel more submissive and obedient.\n\nOne setup I /usually/ hate is blackmail... Yes, it is very realistic, but it leads to very little build up... Usually once the blackmail material is revealed it goes directly into \"ok, you're my sex slave, let's do it.\" I'm not saying it couldn't be done right under the correct circumstances (or added onto some other idea) but an exclusive blackmail setup doesn't peak my interests.\n\nOther kinks include impregnation, public play, humiliation, mild bondage, name calling, bimbofication, D/s... My only real limits are blood and scat. If you've made it this far, thank you for reading... Shoot me a message with your ideas &amp; thoughts about what setup you'd like to do... Please send me more than 1 sentence. And like I said earlier, yahoo messenger is preferred, but I am open to other options too if I like the setup.","media":null,"ups":2,"retrieved_on":1440933598,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":0,"saved":false,"over_18":true,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_2ude0o","link_flair_css_class":null,"id":"2ude0o","archived":true,"from":null,"author":"[deleted]","is_self":true,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2ude0o/22_f4m_im_looking_to_rp_where_im_forced_to_submit/","secure_media":null,"created":1422760214,"subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","from_kind":null,"stickied":false,"edited":false,"score":2,"quarantine":false}

So I'm 12 days into my current streak. I was around the 25 day mark and feeling great, but I decided for whatever stupid reason I could totally handle an MO without the P, but of course slippery slopes and all that shit basically lead to me eating an entire week give or take on a PMO binge. And honestly I'd be lying if I said at the time I didn't think it was awesome, but I guess that's the way a lot of us here work. NOT worth in the long run. So fast-forward through that, and I'm feeling shitty for busting so much perfectly good time on bullshit, and woke up one day totally ready to re-commit, starting my current streak. Now, first and foremost,  this time around I feel like time is moving soooooo much slower than my last run, which I had literally zero trouble with and probably should have just tried to carry on with, considering I was so close to my 30 day goal (I know, 5 more fucking days). But each day right now is an uphill battle against the most intense urges I've had in a hell of a long time, and I'm using every trick in the book to get through and I'm happy to say so far I've avoided even edging (which honestly is not an option for me anyway, it'll just turn into the real deal). But that's where we are today, I have viewed some material the last couple days, which I'm trying to stop, cause honestly I have no idea how I've held out through that, but here we are. Stay strong friends, To 30 days and beyond.\n\nA couple of things I do to get through heavy urges:\n-Work out (one of the most common for a reason)\n-Clean my place\n-Cook\n-Cold Showers\nBasically, distract yourself.

I don't know exactly how much he makes. All I know is he works for an oil company and is in management. He lives in a decent house (that he rents) but he plans on buying his own when he gets married (hopefully with me). He doesn't have very many expenses. Just the essentials (water, gas, etc...) plus netflix and spotify. \n\nA couple months ago he started talking about how he wants a new car. Right now he has a 2011 VW. It's completely paid off and everything. But he wants something more grown up. He originally said he doesn't want to get one above $100k. But for the past month and a half he's been dead set on this pre owned Ferrari that costs about $250,000.\n\nI don't know much about money but this just seems like a terrible idea. I'm doing some research right now but I just want more opinions on this.\n\n--\n\n**I'm NOT trying to ask for relationship advice.**\n\n**Update:**\nMy boyfriend said we'll have a serious conversation about it when he gets home. \n\n**Update 2:**\nHe's home. brb.\n\n**Update 3:** **He's not actually going to buy it.**\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nHe finally told me about his money situation. Turns out he makes over $400,000 a year and has a little under $900,000 saved up. I'll go a little into detail on how he makes that much below. Basically he doesn't really see himself buying the Ferrari. It was just a fantasy. He says he's probably gonna buy a BMW for around $100k for now. \n\n**Full Story (Why he wanted the Ferrari and why he makes so much money):**\n\nMy boyfriend grew up in a poor family. I knew that, but I just found out the next part. His dad was a mechanic. The fanciest car his dad ever had was a 1990-something Ford Escort. A bright red one. He always joked that it was his Ferrari. He would put racing numbers and other stuff to make it look a little like a Ferrari (well as much as it could). It's a classic sob story; his dad took very good care of him and made him happy even with their bad situation.When my boyfriend turned 18 he decided one of his life goals is to buy his dad a Ferrari. So he tried super hard in college, got a nice job, and works very hard at it. He was planning on buying his dad a Ferrari in about 10 years, however his dad passed away last year. \n\nSo when we were looking at cars a couple months ago, apparently he looked at that Ferrari when I wasn't with him. He said it brought him to tears thinking about how that could have been his dad's. You can probably guess why he wanted that Ferrari so bad. \n\n**Summary**:\n\nHe has no plans on buying that Ferrari for now. He's going to buy a much cheaper car (I think he said something about a BMW M5).\n\n**Update 4:** My bf's Reddit username is /u/LovesYourHappiness if you want to ask him anything about finances, work, or this post.","media":null,"link_flair_text":"Auto","permalink":"/r/personalfinance/comments/2udgho/my_boyfriend_is_planning_on_spending_250000_on_a/","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"My boyfriend is planning on spending $250,000 on a new car.

I obbsess about fitness and I've gone through spurts of exercise my whole life but I always stop after ea certain point and I never maintained a good diet even though I know whats it and whats bad for me I just don't fucking care. \n\nAnyway with that out of the way, I work in a sex store, its been my first job I got in through family and I've been here for almost 2 years now despite having almost no experience in sex. I've had sex less than like 15-20 total times. My relationships with women are often poor and unhealthy. Anyways Just now a few minutes ago I had a pair of ratchet ass hoodrats being annoying and harassing male customers asking questions and cutting me off mid sentence to ask what something did or what the price was. For most of the stuff I had nothing to really say other than generic shit about the products and most of the time people don't give me shit for it but these chicks were just like fucking being annoying about it. Like why don't I have a girlfriend? Why don't I have sex? As if IT WERE SO FUCKING EASY ME TO JUST DO THAT. YES I FUCKING KNOW IM NOT QUALIFIED TO BE IN MY POSITION BUT FOR FUCKS SAKE I DONT NEED THAT THROWN IN MY FACE IVE FUCKING BEEN WORKING ON IT WITH GOOD HYGENE AND EXERCISE EVEN THOUGH I HAVE GONE TO THE GYM in like 4 weeks and my diet has been non existent I just overeat, even if its good food. I'll still eat bad food too. \n\nBy the tine they were on the way out my jimmies were so fucking rustled. I said had a good night and she said thats it? You're not gonna wish us luck? I said luck in a monotone voice and then she said yeah youll need it. and they just fucked with me a bit more before they left. \n\nBottom line is I hate myself. I smoke weed every day all the time just to fucking handle reality I work 2 dead end jobs because I failed a math class too many times. I'll stop piling on the guilt there for my own sake. The fact that I have 2 jobs is insane I really thought I would have killed myself in life before this point. I won't even think about how my gym membership or the veggies and fish in my fridge are going to waste while nearly 10 dollars a day goes towards some fast food or take out. \n\n","media":null,"ups":24,"retrieved_on":1440933549,"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1422762560","subreddit":"offmychest","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.offmychest","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Fucking a man","from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","created":1422762560,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2udht5/fucking_a_man/","stickied":false,"score":24,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"num_comments":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_2udht5","link_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"id":"2udht5","from":null,"author":"captainwaffles","is_self":true}
{"permalink":"/r/seduction/comments/2udi37/my_own_little_private_hell_getting_checked_out/","link_flair_text":null,"media":null,"selftext":"Here's my quick story. In high school, I was the loner kid who hung out by himself or with a group of shit head kids who ended up doing prison time later in life. I had terrible self-esteem. I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror.\n\nLater in life, I ate my way up to 300lbs by eating nothing but Jack in the box, getting high, and playing video games with my equally obese girlfriend at the time.\n\nFast forward to now. I'm 33 years old. I've gotten trim, gotten a style of my own and when I look in the mirror I know i'm an attractive man. I get looks pretty much wherever I go. I think i'm somewhat intimidating, since most of the looks are that \"OMG\" look that us men have when we see a really hot girl, but then they look away. Most return eye contact eventually, and some even blush, but I rarely get a smile. I'm smiling more now and that seems to help.\n\nI work the produce dept at a grocery store and am getting checked out all the time from girls (and occasionally hit on by guys), anywhere from the jail bait high school girls to quite older MILFs. The most I can ever manage is a smile and a \"Hi\". I don't know what to say other than the routine job \"need help finding anything today?\". \n\nSo infuriating because my personality is super attractive. The girls at work I joke around with love me. I've had to turn down blow jobs in my car and after work meet-ups with co-workers numerous times. Once I am comfortable enough with a woman to be myself I'm a fountain of charm.\n\nThis is agonizing because I know I could be sleeping with a number of girls (or better yet, finding one worth keeping), but I'm keeping a hot 22 year old on the line because she's the only source of consistent sex even though I'm not into her at all.\n\nI want to say my major problem is a lack of courage to make the first move, but even then, I have no idea of what to say. Any type of help; suggestions, threads, websites, would be much appreciated!\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr: Good looking guy has no game, doesn't know what to say to make first move","retrieved_on":1440933545,"ups":1,"subreddit":"seduction","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1422762728","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.seduction","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"My own little private hell....
