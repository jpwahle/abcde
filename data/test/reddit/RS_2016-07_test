I'm 40 now and when I saw the Vive coming out I made it my mission to be ready to buy one. I've worked my arse off all year and kicked all sorts of goals so that we are in a position to buy this thing without it burning my marriage. I literally got our somewhat blurry finances in order to make sure this could happen.\n\nThis is relevant because it leads to some potentially poor decision making on my part. I just *want* this thing so bad. \n\nSo, Thursday the 23rd I get the nod from the Lady Wife to buy this outrageously expensive toy. I rush to the PC and place the order. At our house the snail mail is a little unreliable, so I opt to use my PO Box. I am aware that not everyone can deliver to PO Boxes, but typically the way it goes is the website complains about the shipping address or you get an email later asking to change it to a street address. Its never been a biggy.\n\nA few times through the night I get up and check my email. At about 4am I see the email declaring that the order is shipped with a tracking number and my card is charged. I hit the tracking link and I'm happy as a pig in shit and literally getting chills. I've done it. Its *happening*. I update my fb gaming friends and they are totes jelly. Glee.\n\nAt 6:50am on friday it all falls apart. I get this cryptic email:\n\n&gt; Thank you for ordering from VIVE.  At your request, a return has been initiated for the following products:\n\n&gt; Product: Vive Kit - Jun 1 (AU)\nQuantity: 1\n\nConfused, I check tracking and it says:\n\n&gt; Unable to deliver shipment, returned to shipper\n\nI get onto live chat and the kind CS representative 'reminds' me that they cannot deliver to PO boxes. I remind the CS rep that you can't be reminded of something you were not told. He says it needs to be escalated and will call me back the following day. I'm worried. I post here. Some people tell me off and say I should call fedex. I call fedex and they say that VIve have the shipment now.\n\nOn Saturday I get a call from HTC Vive CS saying that they don't have it, and I should indeed contact fedex again. I contact fedex, they get the street address and tell me everything is actually OK and that the shipping details will be updated and confirmed Monday morning.\n\nCome Monday I contact fedex and they tell me that the device has been returned to the shipper. The website's contact form and live chat are broken so there is nothing I can do. I reply via actual email and hope someone sees me.\n\nTuesday afternoon I get a call from HTC Vive saying that the order is to be cancelled. I will get a refund. OK. But nobody can say when. It has to go to head office for approval, and once approved will take 3-5 business days to process. Nobody can tell me when this process will actually start. I'm bashing my head against the wall. Why is this so hard? I did nothing wrong, the website should have invalidated my shipping address, why is the CS process hate fucking me?\n\nI'm getting a little desperate and the Vive now looks like its a couple of weeks away from being refunded. I ask the CS rep to confirm that I will definitely get a refund and whether can I just order a new one while I wait. He sounds nervous but agrees that this is the best way to get me a Vive quickly as the refunds process may take a couple of weeks.\n\nI take a deep breath and order another one, accepting that I will be down nearly 3k AUD for a while. Fortunately the finances can bear it. It's annoying but hey, it will be worth it when I get the Vive. Its *fucking awesome*, right?\n\nWednesday afternoon I received another call. This time the CS rep wants to cancel the new order because 'the fastest way to get you the device is to re-route your original order and this will avoid paying twice'. I'm starting to lose it. I agree and hope for the best. He says they will call me on Thursday.\n\nOvernight Wednesday my card is charged for the second order. I'm now $2700AUD in the hole and a week later I don't have a tracking number or even a valid order. Fedex can't help me. They say they have returned my first order and there is no tracking or shipment for the second. \n\nOnce again this morning, its impossible to contact HTC Vive using the official Contact Us page either via 'email' or live chat:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/oOPdHxF.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mwUeWj9.png\n\nIts now Friday morning AU. There is no phone contact. Regular HTC support refuse to talk about Vive ordering issues. Nobody has contacted me for 2 days. I don't want to chargeback but what to do?\n\nOh yeh - **you can *still* place orders to PO Boxes on the website**. They haven't even added a &lt;span&gt; to say not to do that."}

I\u2019m 34, currently studying at uni and about to finish my last semester. In the past I have been rather stupid with my finances (as you will notice when you see my liabilities), and I am hoping to do a rapid 180 and go for FI as soon as I can. Also considering all the options to deal with my unsecured debt, which I haven\u2019t made any payments to in approx. 3 years and had no action taken besides annoying phone calls believe it or not.\n\nI will be on Austudy until November and hoping to gain full time employment soon after. The figures below are what I would expect in terms of minimum income and expenses once in full time employment after my degree. Right now on Austudy and a casual ad hoc job I currently have a surplus of $761 per month, my spending sitting at 40% of income.\n\nA month ago I was spending 96% of my income, but thanks to the wealth of FI info I recently discovered, shopping around on my expenses and some good old fashioned frugality (which runs in the family, conveniently ignored by me for a long time), I have been able to achieve the above and could likely cut it back more but will consider it a bit of a safety margin for now.\n\nAlso worth considering is that if I land the dream job after the degree (very competitive, but a chance of getting it), I would start off on a monthly income $1,357 greater than listed in the first year, then $1,834 greater from year two onwards (after tax).\n\nExpenses \u2013 per month\n-Rent - $650\n-Groceries - $216\n-Public Transport - $80\n-Mobile phone - $15\n-Car Insurance - $25\n-Car Rego - $63\n-Fuel (LPG) - $60\n(Would love to cut out car costs entirely but will need to work from other depots some of the time. Intending on living close to the primary workplace and walking/biking/PT there).\n-Utilities - $150\n\nTotal expenses - $1,259 per month\n\nIncome \u2013 per month\n-Salary - $3,437 (after tax)\n\nTotal income - $3,437 per month\n\nIncome less expenses - $2,178\n\nExpenses as % of income \u2013 37%\n\nAssets\n-Superannuation - $52,000\n-Car - $4000 (paid, no finance)\n-Household items - $300\n-Savings - $250\n\nTotal assets - $56,550\n\nLiabilities\n-Unsecured debt - $53,000 @ 14.35%\n-HECS - $30,000\n\nTotal liabilities - $83,000\n\nNet worth \n-$26,450\n\nDebt options \u2013 pros cons\nI have consulted independent financial counselling and discussed the options available to me. As I haven\u2019t paid anything for a while I have defaulted on my debts. There are three creditors and three small utility bills so a total of six defaulted on which will stay that way for at least 5 years on my credit file once they are dealt with.\n\nDo nothing\n\nA creditor could take me to court and get a judgement on the debt, which allows them to chase me for it up to 15 years, seize income/assets etc. This could put me down the bankruptcy road later on and delay credit repair. An option, but a silly one.\n\n-Pros \u2013 stash cash until they come after me to get it.\n\n-Cons \u2013 doesn\u2019t improve my situation in any way, worsens it.\n\nPay it back\n\nA rough calculation on the moneysmart loan calc gives a required payment of $1,253 p/m to service the debt over 5 years. If I put $2,100 in, it will take at least 2 years and 7 months to pay back. If anything happens in that time to my ability to pay I may end up having to go down the part IX or bankruptcy road, delaying credit repair further.\n\n-Pros \u2013 no acts of bankruptcy required\n\n-Cons \u2013 total amount to be paid unlikely to be reduced, can\u2019t begin required payments until employed FT in another 3-6 months, plus at least another 2.5 \u2013 5 years to get into the black again, if any emergency occurs might end up going bankrupt anyway delaying credit repair, will still take me at least 5 years after to repair my credit for a total of approx. 10 years.\n\nPart IX debt agreement\n\nCan only be done if employed full time, which I am not currently so an additional delay of 3-6 months. Creditors agree on a monthly payment and total amount to pay back, quite possibly less than the $1,253 per month listed below. Must stick with this until it is paid off and if anything happens in future to my ability to pay may end up having to go down the bankruptcy road. The part IX will be recorded as an \u2018act of bankruptcy\u2019 and will stay on my credit file and the national personal insolvency index for an amount of time, then be removed.\n\n-Pros \u2013 fixes a repayment amount likely to be less than the total. Perhaps 60 to 80 cents on the dollar. Record of \u2018act of bankruptcy\u2019 not permanent on credit file or national personal insolvency index. Less restrictions than bankruptcy.\n\n-Cons \u2013 Will still take 3 to 5 years to return to the black and another 5 to repair my credit for a total of 10. If an emergency pops up may have to go bankrupt anyway. \n\nBankruptcy\n\nWipes out all of the unsecured debt (but not HECS) but comes with more restrictions and having the record on the national personal insolvency index for life. Restrictions last for 3 years and 1 day. I have no assets they can seize as they are all under the thresholds. Can\u2019t travel overseas unless for work or special circumstances like illness/death of a family member. Can\u2019t have savings more than $2,000 if paid per fortnight and $5,000 if paid monthly, (unless I take extra cash out at every opportunity and hide it under the mattress \u2013 which is technically illegal but impossible to tell). Gross income earned over $54k is taken at 50c in the dollar to go back towards the creditors. Thresholds for allowable assets and income are indexed to CPI so they increase each year.\n\n-Pros \u2013 Unsecured debt gone and credit repair can occur a few years earlier. A mattress stash could end up about $75k during this time, beginning the road to FI almost immediately.\n\n-Cons \u2013 permanent record. Limited travel, savings. Cash held can\u2019t earn interest. Limits certain jobs (but won\u2019t in my case). Extra earnings above threshold taken at 50c in the dollar. In a defacto/spouse relationship where they own a house I can\u2019t live in it as it can be ruled as having an interest in the property and could be seized for funds. Any windfall I receive during the 3 years will be seized and if it covers what I owe (plus a hefty trustee fee for doing so), the bankruptcy will be annulled. \n\nAside from the financial and legal perspectives I am also considering the effect this has had on me personally. I have been carrying this (self imposed) weight for many years now and the idea of flushing it with a bankruptcy and starting again soon is much more palatable to consider than slogging away for a number of more years until I am 40 before beginning again. I\u2019m leaning towards the bankruptcy option at the moment. Independent financial counselling highlighted this case as a good case for bankruptcy, being careful not to advise it personally as they don\u2019t do that sort of thing.\n\nSo there it is.

I have been lurking for a few days and am finally building up enough courage to post my story. Apologies if my formatting sucks, I have never posted on reddit before.\n\n\nNine years ago, I weighed over 200lbs after having my second daughter. I started running and eating right, and lost 70lbs in a very healthy amount of time. I was able to keep it off until it started creeping back up over the last 2 years. More about this later. I loved running. I ran 5ks, 10ks, half marathons, and full marathons. I found my new obsession and looked forward to my alone time. I made friends and joined a running club. I am very much an introvert so this was a huge social step for me. I was loving life. \n\n\nAbout 5 years ago, I had a small pain in my right glute. I chalked it up to piriformis syndrome and foam rolled to relieve pain when it bothered me too much. Two and a half years ago, while training for my last full marathon, the pain was becoming nearly unbearable, especially during long runs. My final straw was when I completed a seven miler with my running partner, drove home, and couldn't walk because of the pain. I crawled into the house to my foam roller. The pain let up later that night, but I decided to seek professional help. I went to an ortho who tried a steroid injection into my bursa to see if it was bursitis. The injection did nothing. He sent me to physical therapy. The PT put me up on his exam table and started moving my leg around. He discovered he couldn't move my hip past 90 degrees and said, \"Go get an MRI, you have hip impingement and quite possibly a labral tear.\" I, being the typical runner, decided to remain in denial for a few more weeks because a labral tear meant I had to have surgery and couldn't run for quite some time. But the pain continued and I reluctantly called the ortho and requested he order the MRI for my right hip. The MRI confirmed the labral tear along with a sizable CAM impingement on the head of my femur. I was devastated. I was referred to another orthopedic surgeon that specialized in labral repair and scheduled my surgery for March of 2015. \n\n\nSurgery went well, but about six months later I started having the same pain. After a few months of additional PT and steroid injections into the hip (which are as pleasant as they sound, may I add), we did another MRI on the right hip and discovered the repair did not heal correctly (no fault of the surgeon, just my stupid body). At this point, my left hip had started to hurt so we did an MRI on that and discovered another tear. This year, I had my right hip labrum reconstructed in March and my left hip labrum reconstructed in May. Cadaver labrums for the win. I am now recovering well with minimal discomfort and hopeful that I can return to running soon, though I don't know that I will ever run a full marathon again. Which is fine. As long as I can run.\n\n\nAs a result of this extensive injury and downtime, I gained a lot of weight. I am currently at 172lbs and only 5'2\" tall. I am 31 years old, so still relatively young. I hate how much I weigh right now. The only exercise I can maintain for long periods is the stationary bike with no resistance (due to restrictions following the left hip surgery, which is only about 8 weeks out). So my diet is where I need to concentrate as I have a tendency to eat my feelings. I am so happy I found this sub. I have been looking for somewhere to find support and post progress without being judged or ridiculed about my weight. It's already quite embarrassing that I have gained so much weight, particularly with those I used to spend so much time running with. I am back to tracking my calories on MFP. I feel more motivated now. I have to get this weight off. Sorry this was so long!\n\n\nTL;DR 31F, 5'2\", 172lbs. Used to be an awesome runner that weighed 130lbs until injury was discovered. Bilateral hip labrum reconstructions this year. Gained a lot of weight over the last 2 years or so. Happy to be here and looking forward to support.

Maybe just to vent, or maybe looking for answers? Maybe I'll x-post this in a few places until I can find someone who can give me some clarity or even relates. I have thought about this all day, &amp; have a few subjects to cover, so I have proceeded to create a throwaway account &amp; go to town. Here goes nothing: \n\n*The Girlfriend*: I hate my girlfriend. I really do, &amp; this thought comes to mind daily. I even feel bad about it. She's a pretty sweet girl, I get along with her family rather well, she cooks me dinner every night, etc. But there is this other side. She can be all happy &amp; giggling one moment, &amp; the next, yelling in a deep, monsterous tone over almost nothing. I'm really leaning towards bi-polar on this one. I'm under strict control - Be at home by X time, can hang out with these people, but not those people, constantly peaking over my shoulder to see my phone (most of the time I'm just on Reddit or YouTube), cannot go anywhere without her, cannot stay up in the living room playing some Fallout for a little bit while she is in bed, I *must* go to bed at the same time as her. *Will* argue/cry/yell until she gets what she wants. The list goes on. I believe we've been together for almost a year now, &amp; have had sex a handful of times. She's almost 21, I'm 25. The sex wasn't bad or anything, she's asking for it often, I just don't have an appeal for it anymore. She's pretty vanilla, while I grew up much more involved in the BDSM scene. We've attempted to try new things, but it was just awkward. We argue literally every day. I have done some searching in my area &amp; have found a few places for rent, yet for some reason have not found it in me to leave yet. I know that it would tear her apart; she loves me, but the feeling is just not mutual. I know she is a great girl, real pretty, honest, &amp; would never cheat on me, but the cons just seem to outweigh the pros. \n\n\n*The Drugs*: I am a train wreck on this subject. Normally, people stick to a certain fix &amp; keep it simple - I'm far from that. Weed is a common as cigarettes to me, so we'll just ignore that. Suboxone, Roxy, Molly, Percs, Coke, Xanax, etc. If I can get my hands on it, I'll probably put it in my system (so long as it isn't so shit like Meth &amp; whatnot, because fuck Meth). But here's the kicker - I'm not dependant on ANY of it. Sure, it feels great, but I am a man of priority. I only spend \"spare\" cash on it after bills &amp; shit. I don't need it, it just feels great &amp; grounds me (specifically downers). Which leads me to the following subject...\n\n\n*The Void*: When I'm high on Roxy, Subs, Ron, etc., I feel much more like I should. Like I am slightly different, but more of who I was intended to be. I'm at the perfect sociable level, the perfect mindset, yadda yadda. When I'm sober, I feel like I'm just running on autopilot. Quite, short responses like I've come to prefer, staring blankly out at nothing, smoking cigarettes \"just because\". I've found that the only thing that gives me any kind of feeling lately is giving my car a good tune, then just taking it on backroads &amp; just drive fast. I have friends. I have great, do anything for you friends. \"Homies\", I guess you could say. However, talking to them is just an ear to listen. I feel like I need some kind of guidance. I am a higher-up at a damn good job that I love &amp; work my ass off for, yet I do not know that I want it to be a career. I could care less about traveling. I feel like I know what I want out of a relationship, but am not sure what kind of woman I want in it.

It's such a long story but I can't write out the whole thing, and couldn't expect anyone to read it. we met over a year ago, she lives in europe but travels sometimes to the U.S. \n\nWe connected immediately when she was here in new york learning about filmmaking. I worked at the school she was taking a class at, and after the day we met we spent hours and hours hanging out in the edit lab together every day. We sort of went out on a date, but when we were actually out she said she didn't realize it was supposed to be a date (she later told me she knew but was too nervous to let it just be a date). \n\nWe didn't see each for months after her class ended but we developed a close friendship over skype, and got to the point where we were talking every day, sometimes for 5-6 hours at a times. Sometimes more than once a day. I continued to pursue her romantically and she would say things like she couldn't deal with any kind of relationship while she was focusing on her career. She had also recently broken up with someone, the first man she had ever really loved, and was having a hard time getting over it.\n\nI went to visit her in december and stayed with her for about a month and a half. A couple weeks before I went she told me she had been thinking a lot about us and implied she was ready for a relationship. She has a really hard time saying the words \"i want...\" but she made it obvious.\n\nThe first night I was there was incredible. Best night of my life. She told me she had never connected with anyone the way she had with me, she told me she believed we were married in a past life (she used to be very spiritual and had past life experiences. not spiritual anymore but carries that with her). She said she was actually terrified when we met because she recognized me. I had this feeling that day like we had met a thousand times before, and now I understood why.\n\nWe fell asleep on the couch together for a while, and made out for an hour when she woke up. I knew she was really sensitive and when she told me she needed me to sort of let things be and she would come to me when she wanted this kind of closeness, I was okay with it. very okay. Because I felt my life coming into focus. and she did come to me a couple times after that. She called it \"having moments together\". \n\nI have a pretty awful history with women and have always been let down again and again in some pretty epic ways, but now it all felt worth it and I had never been happier. The best day was when she came to me feeling like she needed to be held and walked into my arms while I was sitting, and I pressed my head into her stomach and put my arm around her. I felt needed and everything was so amazing.\n\nBut a week later it fell apart when she kind of freaked out about things moving forward. I was so upset but was still going to be there another 5 weeks. We were working on a film project together and I was more or less okay with it and figured we would be able to pick up where we left off at some point.\n\nThe romance thing came up with a few more times and she would say that it wasn't that we would never be together, she just couldn't even think about it right now. there was nobody else, but she didn't want to promise me anything. \n\nin february she came to visit me for my birthday and told me she had gone to see this sort of \"energy reader\" woman. not really a psychic, more like she helps you answer tough questions based on how she interprets your feelings and body language, stuff like that. this woman told her we shouldn't start a relationship if we were working together because it could all go south if the relationship didn't work out. My point was that could happen either way, but I felt like a romantic relationship would elevate the working relationship, and not being together would mean i wouldn't be able to keep this up forever. She's a great, pragmatic producer and director, and I'm an artist and together there's basically nothing we can't do together. We both agree we elevate each other in amazing ways, but to me it's still being held back by just being friends. And also I can't imagine another girl being okay with me constantly skyping with this gorgeous european woman. \n\nAnyway I felt awful after that, like I was being put in this box, compartmentalized. And I kind of hated that she was basically getting everything she wanted from me but I had to stuff my feelings down my throat. But I continued to believe it would happen some day when she was ready. After we \"broke up\" there was still some physical closeness but it slowly started to go away. I could ask her to sit with me and she would let me put my around her and she would put a hand on my leg and I would stroke her hair, but after a few minutes she would say \"okay that's enough\" and walk away like she had done me this big favor. But she said she felt wrong about it because she knew I wanted more.\n\nShe's here now, we're making a new film together, and it was her birthday the other day. I gave her an amazing gift that she completely flipped out for. Two nights ago she told me she was thinking about how she might be ready to get into a relationship again. She didn't say it about me, just in general, like she was done being alone.\n\nToday we had a talk about us, I just wanted to tell her that I loved her (we've said it to each other before) and I felt like I said a lot of stupid things to her that pushed her away because I was scared of being vulnerable. This was a fear of hers when we first talked about it and she had been starting to really open up to me and I wanted to do the same. It's like I hadn't really been living \"in love\" and wanted to start. But her response was not great. She basically said she wanted me to find a way to deal with my feelings for her because she was starting to really worry that when she meets someone, I won't be able to continue working with her. She said \"what happens when I get married? Because I will at some point\", and said something about how us being together was \"not possible\". I just didn't know how to respond.\n\nI am going to be devastated when she finds someone. I've been in a similar situation around 13 years ago when I developed an incredible friendship/connection with someone and she rejected me and dated someone else. It feels like the story of my life, but these two girls are the only people I've ever been in love with, and I'm starting to feel like I just don't deserve it. I'm 33 and I am so ready to be with her, to commit to her the way her most recent boyfriend couldn't. But what am I supposed to do when she meets another guy? She expects me to \"deal with my feelings\" so I can continue to give her everything she wants.\n\nShe's been working on her first feature film script and a couple weeks ago, before she was here, she told me on skype that she \"needed me\" to help on it. She said she needed me again a few days later, i don't remember the context, but it made me feel so good. And she told me about this thing she was really self-conscious about, a physical trait she had never told another soul about, not even her previous boyfriend (it's something no one would notice on their own). It's like we're so close when she's not actually near me, but she treats me like she's always doing me a favor by spending time with me when we are near each other. I think it's a defense mechanics to keep people at arms length. She had pretty much the worst childhood you can imagine and has a whole lot of baggage in that arena. \n\nI know she has trouble saying things that she wants, so it really meant something to me when she said she needed me, but now I feel like I'm just falling in line like an employee or something. I hate the idea of letting her down by bailing on her, but what am I supposed to do? I have no interest in being with any other women, so I don't feel like I can just find comfort elsewhere. But when she tells me she's met someone I'm just going to lose my shit. \n\nLast time it happened I spent 5 years in a depression. That was only after a month of being strung along, but now it's been over a year and I don't know where I am anymore. She's put me through so many emotions, and when she finally bombs the whole thing I'm going to crash and be depressed for the rest of my life.\n\nI know anyone's advice who's gotten this far will be for me to tell her to take a hike, and they're probably right, but I feel so strongly about this. It's like I know something she doesn't know and need to find a way to get her to see it. I'm at the point where I feel like i need to start manipulating her, which I hate. I used to do that back in high school, turning people into what I wanted them to be for me, but moved past it. But now it's like there's a ticking clock on this relationship, and if I just roll over and accept it I'll end up devastated and alone. Although she is in some ways very strong-minded, she can also be convinced of things and I feel like I need to find a way to basically trick her into being with me. \n\nI've felt like a monster a few times in my life, I wanted this thing to be pure and beautiful but I'd rather have it by any means than let her destroy me. Jesus just writing this stuff makes me feel like a monster. I'm just rambling now anyway.

However I can picture her clearly in my mind, its the girl with a teeth face from 'Cabin in the Woods', although the weird thing is, it's been a LONG long time (like 2 or 3 years tops) since I've watched ANY kind of horror stuff because I was too busy with my college projects and exams.\n\nNow whenever I close my eyes again that night, I can instantly sense her again there, not just standing but moving her arms and fingers to groom my fairly long hair, but deep inside, I know it's the electric fan that's doing that (though I'm still not quite sure if that REALLY is the case...).\n\nDue to this incident, I wasn't able to get any sleep that night and morning came, but I was still filled with dread and fear inside my heart, my arms and hands were trembling, I can barely stand up from the bed without breathing heavily and checking to see if the girl is hiding beneath the bed. I also caught cold and heavy coughing in the morning up until the following weeks.\n\nKeep in mind that THAT was two weeks ago, the following days we're much smoother in comparison even though I got sick with fever.\n\nBut then now, one night when I was finally recovering from my fever and cold, suddenly out of nowhere, I can't sleep again, and I once again feel this presence of the girl with the teeth mouth slowly and gently grooming my hair (again, it could just be the electric fan, but I'm terrified as fuck and I don't even know what's what right then...), I could also hear weird sudden noises all around (that could also just be me distorting the sound that the nearby radio makes, like I said, I can't tell anymore...). That night I refused to open my eyes to check if everything is okay because I was so terrified, horrified and afraid of seeing something that is not supposed to be there.\n\nThis went on for the whole night, my arms trembled at a rate I've never experienced, I was generally spooked and puzzled at the same time, \"What the fuck is happening to me?\" I thought...\n\nI wasn't exactly \"paralyzed\" in those two nights since I was able to move my arms and legs but I was curled up like an armadillo, I was sweating heavily, I had difficulty breathing, I was trembling, I couldn't focus my mind to sleep as well since the image of the girl with a teeth face is carved deep within the memory that I can't take my thought off of it. I was so confused because I don't even find that girl scary and yet there I was shaking. \"Why can't it just leave me alone, what the fuck is going on!?\" I thought. And then the thought hit me that I might be currently suffering from some kind of a sleep disorder that involves the aforementioned symptoms.\n\nJust for information, I am 18 years of age and male. I also wrote this whole text post in the morning right after the night I couldn't sleep, ergo I am crazy tired right now.\n\nSo, what sleeping disorder accurately matches my situation and how do I treat it/cure it?\n\nI'd also like to inform that I am new to reddit and I couldn't post this in Yahoo Answers because it was too long of a paragraph, I am just desperate for answers right now, I want it to end...","score":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"domain":"self.SleepDeprived","secure_media":null,"ups":1,"distinguished":null}

I thought I was doing really well. Sure, only being an hour or so total into playing Mei, I'm a bit icewall happy, but when I realize that a wall is worthless, I take it down. But the best thing I have learned about Mei's useful utility on these contol maps is icewall blocking players from the entrances to prevent contesting during friendly capture/overtime.\n\nSo, back to my game I played. We were about to win, got into overtime, and an enemy Reaper was heading towards the point to reset the timer. Roadhog on my team (who is standing on the point) hooks the Reaper just as I put an icewall up, blocking Reaper from being pulled past the wall onto the point. We win that round as overtime runs out. \n\nNow, knowing people detest Mei's in general because a lot of people don't fully understand her (I don't either), I immediately apologized on team voice chat and explained that it was a good thing, because the hooked Reaper would have reset the timer. Maybe 10 seconds later, the guy who played Roadhog typed \"Mei, you're fucking useless\".\n\nI try to explain in voice chat again, but I don't think he was in it. Next round, this guy continues to knock my Mei, and another joins in too, and I become self conscious. What if I really am doing terribly? Am I really that bad to warrant so much negativity? \n\nWe're on the map where I've won playing Bastion a good amount of times, so I switch from Mei. We lose extremely quickly, and that second person says \"Would have been better if we had full strength\" while Roadhog guy says \"Why the fuck did you play Bastion??\"\n\nI just don't understand. I had to leave the party after Defeat. The most I could do was ignore them. \n\nHonestly guys, it's a game. I just read that Reddit post the other day about someone on the verge of raging when they heard a 10 year old kid come on voice chat apologizing for not doing so well. And that broke my heart. Sure, I may be slightly phased and put down by these toxic players, but I'm 24. I don't want to even imagine how much of a negative impact the toxicity has on children.\n\nIf you're having a bad game, take a deep breath. Maybe it's you. Maybe it's your teammate. Maybe the enemy team is really good. The beauty of it all is that teams switch up game to game, games only last a bit of time in quick play, and you can start over. You can leave a team with what you think are horrible players, add them to unpreferred, and be done with it. \n\nHowever, generally you cannot undo the lasting psychological effects a child obtains when you tell at them for being stupid. Telling them they suck at Hanzo, when Hanzo is their all time favorite..\n\nI suppose I digressed a lot from sharing my Misunderstood Mei story. But don't let this game get eaten by toxic gamers. This game is incredible, and all you who play are incredible. Don't let some ex-League or CoD players or general douchebags tell you any differently.","author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"secure_media":null,"domain":"self.Overwatch","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"ups":0,"id":"4qpips","saved":false,"num_comments":1,"stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2u5kl","from_id":null,"link_flair_text":"News &amp; Discussion","author_flair_text":null,"quarantine":false,"created_utc":1467341295,"hide_score":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/4qpips/after_experiencing_misunderstood_mei_if_youre/","locked":false,"media":null,"author":"Starshine_Pneumonia","over_18":false,"retrieved_on":1472831353,"from_kind":null}

I don't really care this time around if my FB friends know if I'm pregnant or not.  They'll figure it out eventually anyway.\n\nSo backstory:  I have Lupus.  My first pregnancy was an oops, and I wasn't taking my medicine.  As a result, my son was born with 3rd degree heartblock and had to have a pacemaker put in at 5 days old.  It sucked, but it's hardly the worst thing that's happened to women and their babies.  Besides having to stress out TSA whenever we fly, he's as normal as any other 2 year old.  He has a ton of energy, is very active, has a huge vocabulary, loves to chatter, and enjoys the company of other people immensely, especially other kids.\n\nHusband and I deliberated for a long time about #2, but I've been on my meds since #1 was born.  Rheumatologist said I was fine.  All organs look good, and my meds greatly reduce the chance of this happening again.  OB checks me out and gives me the clear.  Husband and I agree we will try until I'm 35 and if I'm not pregnant by then, we will walk away with only 1 kid.  Well I got pregnant!  \n\nFast forward: So I'm browsing baby names, and I come across the name of a friend's roleplay character who I adored back in the day when we still played together.  It surprised me since it's so unusual, and I excitedly messaged her saying I found her name in a baby names list!  This has been kinda how I've casually told many of my friends privately I'm pregnant, just sorta dropping it and then giggling about it later.  \n\n&gt;Her: what are you trying to name?\n\n&gt;Me: a nugget in my uterus.  This doesn't bode well since for 15 years I couldn't name RP characters to save my fuckin life.\ngood luck naming a human!\nI got a pass with the first one cuz he was automatically named after his dad.  this next one I shall call \"thing\"\n\n&gt;Her: are you sure getting pregnant again is smart? the first one was so risky\n\n&gt;Me: too late now.  doctors say it should be fine anyway since I'm actually taking my meds.  I wasn't taking them before.  Wiggles turned out fine anyway.\n\n&gt;Her: if you call a heart condition fine, sure lol...it just sounds careless\n\n&gt;Me: He lives life like a normal kid.  plenty of kids are born with other conditions that are much worse off than him.\n\n\nI'm just kinda annoyed by this response.  I'm 34 years old, and have one kid that turned out great.  I really didn't like the fact that I felt I needed to defend my choice to get pregnant.  How does she know what sort of care has gone into it anyway?  Does she expect by saying that to me, that I'll suddenly drop everything and go get an abortion?  I mean really?  There are ways of voicing your concerns with someone that aren't immediately attacking them.  I mean how about start by getting all the info before you tell someone their pregnancy is careless?  I'm pretty butthurt.","ups":56,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"domain":"self.BabyBumps","secure_media":null}

I went through something similar at that age and I knew it was because I felt worthless and had been told I was worthless from my father.  (I'm 22 now and this isn't about me.)  My uncle won't let the boy leave the house and tries to force him to do his work by locking him in his room.  I know this boy isn't stupid and he's not lazy.  He's threatened to hurt himself, and I'm not sure if he has or has not already done so.  I only hear what my parents tell me because I'm not allowed to talk to my cousins very often.\n\nThat all sounds horrible, but it's the girl I'm more worried about.  I first noticed she was having problems when she was in kindergarten/1st grade.  If she'd do something goofy that she wasn't really supposed to, she would mumble to herself, \"That was stupid, ____.  You are stupid.\"  Now she's started to develop really weird habits about her eating and bowel movements.\n\nI'm not supposed to know any of this but I feel like I have to do something to help my family.  I have a chance to talk to my uncle about it on Tuesday, and I need to know if there's anything I can say to him or any way I can get him to break the kids' endless punishment for failing school work and behaviors so that I can get them out of the house for a little bit and talk to them.  He of course thinks that he and his wife are blameless and their kids are the problem.  I know he's taken them to a therapist a few times and at the least, the boy is on some medication for a tick that he has.\n\nTL,DR; My aunt and uncle are terrible parents and I want to know if there's any way I can help my cousins.","score":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media":null,"domain":"self.raisedbynarcissists","ups":4,"distinguished":null,"link_flair_css_class":"advicequestionarticle","media_embed":{},"thumbnail":"self","from":null,"archived":false,"title":"Concerned cousin","gilded":0,"edited":1467342686,"permalink":"/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4qpkll/concerned_cousin/","name":"t3_4qpkll","is_self":true,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","created_utc":1467342051,"hide_score":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4qpkll/concerned_cousin/","secure_media_embed":{},"quarantine":false,"author":"54243201","locked":false,"media":null,"retrieved_on":1472831381,"from_kind":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"id":"4qpkll","stickied":false,"num_comments":7,"subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","link_flair_text":"[Advice Request]","from_id":null,"author_flair_text":null}

{"selftext":"I am 16, male and never leave the house. I have no social life, no girlfriend, I got kicked out of school last year because of a death threat I wrote on the schools bathroom (they let the school handle it, i didnt go to jail, nobody found out and I spent my remaining months at home with nothing to do at home). Whenever I see my former friends/aquantinces on snapchat or facebook post videos or pictures with their friends or boyfriend/girlfriend it always gets me upset because I know I'll never have that. I have tons of shit wrong with me, im fucked up in the head, its just...ugh. If only I had an answer or could explain what im trying to say. People walk all over me, treat me like dirt, stare at me, talk about me behind my back, I get mad/sad, I start developing anxiety/depression and eventually anger issues, then I get grounded for showing my anger, anger issues develop into wanting to kill everyone that fucks with me, I go to therapy but therapy dosent work cause the therapist dosent know what im trying to say...\n\nEdit: Oh and also the fact that my own brother dosent wanna include me when hes with his friends. Like my parents want me to go to Six Flags with my brother and his friends, well guess what? His his friends are going he says \"I'm not trying to be rude but alot of my friends are going and I don't want you to go because you'll just get tired and have to stop and take breaks, then you will tell mom that I left you out\". He's basically complaining about me having to take breaks cause I have a heart defect and he dosent wanna get embarrassed in front of his friends. \n\nLast Edit: I also feed as though drinking solves my problems. Whenever I drink I feel happier and like everyone is my friend and i have no more worries. I started drinking like probably 2 years ago i dont really remember, but whenever i do drink its 3 beers (as long as I get up to 10% or 14% alcohol volume then i stop) and then im done. It usually gives me a good buzz. but then when its over i start feeling depressed again and want it again (or atleast after i stop feeling like shit, even though i barely do and really never ever had a hangover and only had 1 when i drank straight up whiskey)\nI think I'm just gonna end it here.

I am 30 and have been varying levels of deaf for most of my life. Growing up, hearing aids weren't an option financially. I was also more able to live a normal daily life without any extra assistance, so they weren't necessary. \n\nIn the past 6-8 months though, my hearing has gone downhill fast. Based on recent doctor visits, basically, fluid behind my ears along with chronic poor ear health has caused irreversible damage to the point that unassisted, normal human voices sound like a whisper. Anything more than that, I simply cannot hear at all.\n\nI have been fitted for hearing aids and am scheduled to receive them on July 6th. (I have included a photo of the ear mold done for the hearing aids - it was pretty weird.)\n\n[ear mold picture](https://imgur.com/MgC2sw4)\n\nThe hospital my audiologist works in works with a company called Prosper, who handles the financial side of all of this. I applied for the loan amount of $3500, as my insurance company will pay $1000 and my family has been generous enough to scrape together another $1000.  Today I found out that I was denied the loan of $3500. Without this, I cannot get my hearing aids, period. Between rent and other essential bills, it would take my spouse and I months, maybe a year to save up that kind of money with our jobs (me: min wage retail, her: full time govt employee) and it breaks my heart to think about a silent world for so much more time. \n\nSo I'm asking, begging, pleading for help. I am happy to provide anything I can that would prove who I am and that I would use any money obtained for hearing aids. Any money obtained would be a *LOAN*. I am in the process of selling some of my late mother's music instruments and will be able to pay back in full once they are sold. \n\nI just don't know what to do at this point. I've waited so long to hear the wind in the trees, or even the sound of my wife's voice, and it breaks me to think about never hearing those things again.

It makes it sound like what I chose is a bad thing or they should be uncomfortable and think if they want to continue seeing me or not. In a perfect world I would hope this wouldn't matter as I have been seeing everyone for years, some upwards a decade but oh well.\n\nAlso my last question : another thing thats holding me back are my breasts. I have a VERY curvy hour glass body which I am now well, fat for a variety of reasons. I am working on getting the weight off however I'm just now trying to shop for a binder. I am 5'10 and a 38DD. The reality is I won't be getting top surgery earliest next spring.. but more than likely next fall. I don't want to start having these physical changes with huge breasts. I would feel awful. I am hoping the weight loss will make binding more realistic. \n\nThoughts? suggestions?\n\nI orginally had the plan on losing the extra weight, working on getting back into decent shape THEN starting T  but that didn't work as the dysphoria got so bad I was back to suicidal thoughts. I am so worried about my private business but I can't keep living in a secret. I thought about stopping T for awhile but I feel it would really be a detriment to my emotional well being.

{"selftext":"Hi there. I'm 21, turning 22 in a couple weeks, and all I want to do is move out. \n\nI currently am living rent free at my parents' house. Ideal right? Not so much. My parents are incessantly nagging on me constantly, despite the fact that I'm working 65+ hours a week between 3 jobs. I help out around the house. I clean what I use and never leave a mess about. I do chores and make sure things are tidy before I settle down for the evening. My parents, but mostly my dad, constantly tells me I have to do more around the house. \"We have to do this. We have to do that. Why can't you just notice this needs to be done and do it before I have to tell you?\" Not very detailed, but it gets the point across. \n\nIn December of 2014, just after the Christmas holiday, I went in for surgery to remove a growth on the base of my spine. At first it was thought to be cancerous due to the rate at which it grew, but after the surgery, and many tests, it was found to be benign. Due to the location of this growth, it made doing simple tasks such as walking or sitting for any amount of time very painful. Unfortunately for me, I wasn't covered under my parents' insurance and I didn't qualify for my own, and it was about 5 days between deciding to do the surgery and actually doing it, so I was completely uncovered. I'm now paying for the surgery 100% out of pocket. The original bill was about $9,000 and I've been able to (so slowly) get it down to about $5,500.\n\nIn February of this year I bought my own car! I got a loan for just under $3,000 and have been making all the payments, though it's not many, in full and on time. That balance is at about $2,500 that I owe. \n\nIt makes me incredibly unhappy and is one of my greatest stressors living with my parents. They don't appreciate the hard work I'm doing to put myself in a better place financially before taking off and starting my life. Some days it feels like they only think of me as an incompetent roommate. \n\nSorry this turned out so long. I guess my question is along the lines of \"Is there more that I can be doing to reduce my debt faster so that I am able to afford moving out?\" I'm paying all of my bills on time, and sometimes I pay more than I owe that billing period just so I'm one step closer. I wanted to be out of my parents house before the summer ended, but I don't think that's a feasible option at this point. \n\nThanks for any information any of you can share! I appreciate it greatly.

{"score":30,"author_flair_css_class":null,"selftext":"Hi, I've posted this a few other places so I apologize if you've seen it already.  I really need help.  My aunt and uncle have always been high-strung and can act psychotic, to put it lightly. After my aunt found out she couldn't have kids, they adopted two children as infants, a boy now in 7th grade and a girl in 4th. My aunt never really cared for the kids, she says she's not a real mother and the kids can't even spend Mother's Day with her because it makes her \"feel sad.\" My uncle was the one who took them to school/cared for them all through their lives, but he is overly controlling and makes comments about how they shouldn't have gotten kids, often when they're in the same room.\n\nThe boy is exceptionally smart, I can't keep up with most of the things he tries to tell me. But there's a chance that he may have to repeat 7th grade because he's not doing his school work. I went through something similar at that age and I knew it was because I felt worthless and had been told I was worthless from my father. (I'm 22 now and this isn't about me.) My uncle won't let the boy leave the house and tries to force him to do his work by locking him in his room. I know this boy isn't stupid and he's not lazy. He's threatened to hurt himself, and I'm not sure if he has or has not already done so. I only hear what my parents tell me because I'm not allowed to talk to my cousins very often.\n\nThat all sounds horrible, but it's the girl I'm more worried about. I first noticed she was having problems when she was in kindergarten/1st grade. If she'd do something goofy that she wasn't really supposed to, she would mumble to herself, \"That was stupid, ____. You are stupid.\" Now she's started to develop really weird habits about her eating and bowel movements.\n\nI'm not supposed to know any of this but I feel like I have to do something to help my family. I have a chance to talk to my uncle about it on Tuesday, and I need to know if there's anything I can say to him or any way I can get him to break the kids' endless punishment for failing school work and behaviors so that I can get them out of the house for a little bit and talk to them. He of course thinks that he and his wife are blameless and their kids are the problem. I know he's taken them to a therapist a few times and at the least, the boy is on some medication for a tick that he has.\n\nTL,DR; My aunt and uncle are terrible parents and I want to know if there's any way I can help my cousins.","ups":30,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"secure_media":null,"domain":"self.JUSTNOFAMILY","archived":false,"title":"Concerned cousin - please help","gilded":0,"edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"from":null,"thumbnail":"self","media_embed":{},"permalink":"/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/4qps8u/concerned_cousin_please_help/","subreddit":"JUSTNOFAMILY","is_self":true,"name":"t3_4qps8u","created_utc":1467345273,"hide_score":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/4qps8u/concerned_cousin_please_help/","quarantine":false,"retrieved_on":1472831490,"from_kind":null,"over_18":false,"author":"54243201","locked":false,"media":null,"stickied":false,"num_comments":13,"saved":false,"id":"4qps8u","subreddit_id":"t5_3a182","link_flair_text":null,"from_id":null,"author_flair_text":null}
