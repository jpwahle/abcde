The idea of having another woman out there who knows what I'm doing or thinking all the time is a huge turn on for me. Would absolutely love to tell you all about my day and or my sexual thoughts as they come up. Possibly even more if we get comfortable with each other hehe. I personally am not that great at roleplaying but we could still give that a shot if you'd like.\n\nI am open to women of all ages/races/body types. Specifically, I am interested in the mature and thick women. Being in college I find my self surrounded by the average skinny, young, pretty girls out there all the time, and it just doesn't cut it for me anymore. With that being said, don't be discouraged if you aren't mature or bbw! I would love to chat with you anyway.\n\nA little about myself: 21 years old, and am a college student, and looking to spice things up a bit.  Physically I am 5'8, average build (around 140 lbs), asian, black hair, and have a very hard 6 inch cock that never seems to go down. Like every other guy out there, I have an extremely high sex drive. I would masturbate almost every opportunity I have throughout the day. Some of my kinks include panties, feet, bdsm, light public play, and a whole lot more. I am pretty much open to anything excluding scat or gore.\n\nI know finding a long term partner on this sub is difficult, so If you only have a few minutes to play or chat I would still love to hear from you! I promise to answer in a timely manner as I am never too far from my phone or a computer. We can chat via reddit, but I do prefer kik as it allows me to get notifications for messages.\n\nI apologize for the long post and I hope to hear from some of you beautiful ladies soon!

About two years ago we had a lot of family gathered together for a certain occasion and my cousins and I spent the night drinking together. My three male cousins,  my brother and I were all getting extremely hammered. At the end of the night there are portions I don't remember at all. It was winter and my cousins house was quite cold and so when we went to bed on the couch there was no blanket and somehow it worked out that one of my cousins - let's call him Max, he's 36 at this point and I'm 24 - cuddled me all night. It was pretty innocent but I remember my heart racing and getting so wet and wanting to make a move but my brother was sleeping on the floor next to us and even drunk I wasn't willing to go that far. I had always been attracted to him he is about 6'2\" and very muscular. I had a beast of a hangover the next day and we never talked about it and he left town that next day. \n\nFlash forward to a few months ago. Max came to town to visit my family and I knew in the back of my mind that something was going to happen. I was so turned on by that one night but I had no idea what to do about it. The night Max came into town we all went out drinking and got really wasted. We took an uber home at the end of the night with my parents and Max and I sat in the back seat together and he put his hand on my thigh. I was drunk and incredibly turned on and couldn't wait to get inside. \n\nMy mom had a room all set up for him but when I went to bed on the couch Max came into the living room and he said he had looked everywhere for a blanket and couldn't find one. I told him he could share mine as my heart started beating out of my chest. He settled down alongside me on the couch spooning me very close and it wasn't long before I was holding his hand and then slid it under my shirt to my bare boobs. He sighed and started feeling me up and I don't think I have ever been so aroused in my life. He pulled me around on top of him and we started making out and he pulled my hand down to feel his super hard dick. I was about to say no we shouldn't when he slid my hand inside his boxers and I felt that he was absolutely dripping precum and it turned me on so much. He then put me on the outside and started pushing himself inside me from behind and I was so incredibly wet and turned on I came very fast. He didn't cum I think he was scared because we were just in the living room and I told him I wasn't on birth control. \n\nWe ended up having sex a few times over the next two days that he was in town and then I went to visit him in his town and we had sex a bunch more and it was always awesome. I started to think I was in love with him and I ended up telling my mom about it and she was horrified and it ended things between us which really sucked but I think it's for the better because I wouldn't want to actually get together with my cousin for real. I guess we have incredibly hot memories and who knows maybe sometime in the future it will happen again.

I am 16 years old and have two older and one younger sibling. My mom is n and my dad is an enabler although he has gotten better over the years. Basically my nMom got her boobs done and a facelift? Soon after she began an affair with Jake, My older sister found out and we had to look at the gross messages and photos of our mom that no kid should ever see m. Anyway my dad confronted her, gave her a chance to end it and she chose jake. My dad was hurt and angry and moved out, they're currently going through a divorce.\n\nIt has seemed like my mom was rubbing the affair in all of our faces, openly calling her affair partner and telling him she loves him, would disappear in the middle of the night to see him. She's acting like me, a fucking teenager who just discovered what love is. \n\nI hate jake, he's socially awkward towards us and tries too be cool with us. Not to mention he aided in wrecking our family. Jake is also a former alcoholic, has had multiple duis. I just don't want him in my life. He also has a dead end job. \n\nNmom brings him around the house frequently, they mostly disappear into her room and aren't shy in the noises they make. She gives me the aren't you happy for me speech? Jake makes me so happy. They go out to dinner frequently (she pays) barely does anything with our family anymore. She is a pathetic excuse for a mother. She had my dad wrapped around her finger and now she has this loser who she cares about more than her own children.\n\nI currently have a boyfriend, who I have never invited over because I don't want him to experience the awkwardness. Just told him my family is fucked up. Nmom knows about him and told me if she finds out we're having sex she's going to take my phone away.\n\nShe has gotten mad at me because I've been rude to her and unsupportive in her words, and I don't make any effort to know jake. I don't care to know him or want to know him. What she's done and is doing is disgusting to me. Why does she feel the need to shove this guy down our throat and that she's \"so in love\" with him?","distinguished":null,"archived":false,"is_self":true,"retrieved_on":1492477188,"contest_mode":false,"gilded":0,"id":"62papi","author":"intothenight16","hide_score":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","media":null,"score":42,"secure_media_embed":{},"hidden":false}

I want to quit, I can manage work stress, but the backstabbing and the lack of response from the owners it's just discouraging. \nI want to leave, parents and friends also advice the same, but I'm afraid I won't find another job like that and I will have to take steps back from my current position because I have no experience in corporate companies, and because the only time I did this, it took me 6 months to get a new job with 50% less salary than the previous one. \n","permalink":"/r/offmychest/comments/62pd9k/25_and_stuck_in_non_advancing_profesional_life/","edited":false,"media_embed":{},"spoiler":false,"media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","secure_media_embed":{},"score":2,"hidden":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"hide_score":false,"author":"aleksimoff","id":"62pd9k","contest_mode":false,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"retrieved_on":1492477287,"is_self":true}

I was on Yaz and then the generic version for many years, which worked. Right now I'm on Seasonale (period 4 times a year), which seems to be working just fine for me.\n\nI'm 28 now, and ballooned in weight (used to eat + feel like garbage/stressful time in my life), went from 135lbs when I was 18 to 265lbs, and I'm 5'5\". I ended up switching to a whole foods vegan lifestyle (very limited soy intake, no faux meats) in December for an unrelated reason (ie not weight), learned how to cook proper food, broke my sugar addiction (I really feel like a whole new person with that), and was surprised at the weight coming off. I'm down 40lbs in 4 months, doing pilates 6/times a week, keeping track of my macros and doing CICO. \n\nMy gyn is my PCP (I have VA healthcare so it's just a women's clinic), she has me taking a women's multivitamin, but I try to eat a varied diet. I'm not scheduled for my full bloodwork/annual exam until January. \n\nI haven't really ever handled my PCOS, but it's something I want to add as I've been taking better care of myself. I've been wondering if I should get a bloodwork check in to make sure my vitamin levels are normal range (so I can switch to just B12 and D3 capsules since I can't get it from plant based diet), like maybe in June to make sure I'm on the right track and then my regular January appointment. Are vitamin/minerals something I should keep tabs on with the PCOS? \n\nI'm also wondering if I should ask for a referral for an endocrinologist? Do I need it? My PCP/gyn is really more GP, since she handles pretty much all the women in this particular VA hospital. The reason I was considering it is because I haven't actually checked in with someone who is really educated about PCOS like...ever.  At least as an adult. I don't have any pain or anything out of the ordinary.\n\nThe last time I had a full blood work done was 4 years ago, blood sugar, cholesterol, and everything came back normal, but I imagine that an endocrinologist checks for other things.\n\nI feel silly considering I've had this condition for over 10 years but don't really know a whole lot beyond the basics.\n\nThank you for any and all help!","thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null}

I had done no research and just figured the guy knew what he was talking about and I knew nothing at all about cycling.  Anyway I rode my bike all summer, turns out I love biking and went at least 3x per week and averaged about 20-30 k per ride.  After a summer of use it started showing the quality of the components and the bike felt really limiting (heavy, uncomfortable).  When I was buying the bike the guy insisted I buy the pre-built one and it was the right size, it felt small but I mistakenly believed him.  It's actually a small (15\") and I'm 5'10\". \n\nSo I've been shopping around quite a bit and reading reviews and think I've settled on a Specialized Allez E5 Sport.  I found a local shop that has one for about 1000 Canadian.  I think I may be able to talk the guy down a bit more.  It feels right size wise vs my existing bike (56cm)\n\nI mainly ride on concrete cycling trails (almost exclusively) and plan on going 2-3 times per week averaging 30k per ride.\n\nSo my questions are: \n1. Is going from a 225 dollar to a 1000 dollar road bike \"too much bike? My buddy who's fairly into cycling as well says it's way too much bike (like going from a Yugo to a Ferrari)\n\n2. Any disadvantage to drop bars?  I know it sounds odd but they seem daunting coming from a sports store bike.\n\n3. Is the Allez E5 Sport a good bike and a good deal in the $1000 range?\n\n4. Going from a super cheap bike to a road bike, my buddy again has told me that, 1. I won't be able to ride it anywhere remotely bumpy (city streets, etc) and 2. I risk wiping out because the tires are too skinny.  Is he exaggerating?\n\nThanks for your help in advance!\n\nI also looked at and test-rode a Giant Contend and a Trek 1.1C but felt the Allez felt nicer and more comfortable","thumbnail":"self","media_embed":{},"edited":false,"spoiler":false,"link_flair_text":null,"quarantine":false,"suggested_sort":null,"secure_media":null,"brand_safe":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/whichbike/comments/62pdno/specialized_allez_e5_sport_2016/","title":"Specialized Allez E5 Sport 2016","author_flair_text":null,"locked":false,"created_utc":1491006383,"over_18":false,"num_comments":6,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"whichbike","domain":"self.whichbike"}

Few have what it takes to devote themselves to the way of the Greatest Lich in League (Irelia doesn't even come close). That's why I'd like to take you through a typical ranked game as Karthus.\n\nI start out by looking at lolskill. The information doesn't tell me much, but what I'm mostly interested in is other people looking at my information over it. My winrate is high, my kills are high, my deaths are low, and my assists are high. I want the enemy midlaner to know that they're about to witness something they've never seen before. For them to fear the creature they're about to meet. \n\nThe game starts up. We are a Tryndamere, Rengar, Karthus, Draven, and Sona and they are a Gnar, Xin, Diana, Jhin, and Brand. Not that it matters, for we have Karthus, and Karthus will win this game for his team. \n\nThe Diana I'm against starts out playing very aggressively. I find this weird because I am Karthus, clearly she doesn't know about my level 1 and 2? Before I can think about it too much, our Draven dies to a gank botlane. That is okay though, for I am Karthus. And I will carry. My rengar is nearby, so I will play up. This Diana has been very aggressive, and I know she will jump on me. I was right, unfortunately my Rengar wasn't the only person ready to jump in the lane, and I have a Xin on me. Me and Rengar both die, however I manage to get a return kill on the Diana. I steel myself for the unfortunate gank, knowing I will carry this game. I will go Morello instead of RoA this game for I don't think this Diana will be too much of a threat with her mistake-ridden playstyle. Diana kills me in a 1v1 a few minutes later. She kills me again a minute later with the only thing I get being an ult kill on Jhin. That is okay though, this Diana's overly aggressive playstyle has caught me off. I am Karthus, I am lategame, I will carry. \n\nWe are now 20 minutes into the game. Our Tryndamere is 1/5, our Draven is 3/7, and I am 4/8. The only person on our team that is truly doing well, the 12/5 Rengar, starts a surrender vote. He proclaims that he is \"unable to carry this shit\". He is right, he cannot carry this. On the other hand, I can carry this. I notice I am double cs over my lane opponent, in fact I am the highest CS in the game. How this happened with my terrible CS I am not sure, but it steels me in knowledge that I can carry this. \n\nThe enemy team is confident. They overstep and my team catches them out. I time my skittles to get the kills. I will need them, for I must carry. I gain more and more strength until when the eventual teamfights come we win them. The enemy team cannot handle what they have never played against, and I can assure you none of them have played against a Karthus. Our Rengar, who had previously been negative to me, has stopped, merely saying now that the enemy is \"just playing bad\". It is okay Kitty, you do not have to accept my carry to be carried. \n\nA few teamfights and amazing outplays by my ultimate and we have done it, we are beating down on their Nexus. In less than 13 minutes I have turned my 4/8 score into a 15/11 score. They doubted me, everyone doubted me, except for myself. For I knew, I am Karthus. I AM the lategame. And I WILL carry. \n\nI am, of course, kidding, NOBODY'S PLAYED KARTHUS SINCE SEASON TWO\n\nThis thread was made purely for fun and was totally not inspired by the \"I am a Yasuo Main\" thread, not one bit. Also it was totally not [based off of a true story](http://i.imgur.com/QCdjDXm.png). And I am actually shit at League (though I like to pretend otherwise). \n\nHAVE A GOOD DAY FOLKS","permalink":"/r/leagueoflegends/comments/62phjl/i_am_a_karthus_main/","media_embed":{},"edited":false,"post_hint":"self","spoiler":false}

I anticipate to complete my PhD in Computational Sciences the end of this year. I am funded under a governmental fellowship, which requires me to work at a governmental national lab (security clearance not required and I don't think they even ran background checks on me either) during the summer yearly for the duration of the fellowship. \n\nI am also a father of an 7 year old, whom I've had sole legal custody (issued through the district court in my home town) of since my child was 3. At the start of graduate school, my child's mother was arrested for 4 accounts of felony child abuse. The things she had done to our child is indescribable and I do not wish to repeat it, but it has left our child traumatized and scarred for life. She was prosecuted and sentenced to life in prison without parole. However, here is where I made my mistake. I was called in to testify against her during the jury trial. I was 23 at the time, and absolutely lost it. I tried to go after her despite being repeatedly told by the judge not to move any further from my testimony stand, which was very stupid in retrospect, and I would like to say it wouldn't happen again if that situation were to happen again, but I honestly wouldn't know. \n\nI was arrested and charged with domestic violence menacing, a misdemeanor, 2 accounts of contempt of court (1 for my menacing conduct, and one for calling the family court judge who gave her full custody a \"piece of shit\" during my cross-examination by her defense attorney). All my charges were dismissed, even though I was pretty guilty obviously.... I was let off pretty easily in that regard.\n\nI am now very worried about finding a job with these criminal charges that are fairly recent (within the past 5 years).

So I met this girl last week on a friends birthday party. I said one thing to her and her friend when they arrived and then ignored her for the rest of the night, until she came over to me and a friend and started talking with us. You guys have to know that i am by no means pretty or anything, im rather ugly and autistic ( was on a party a month ago and a girl told me she liked tall guys and seemed into me so I was like lets go dance because we were kinda standing awkwardly and I dont know how to hold a proper conversation with an attractive girl. House music was playing and I dont know how to dance to that shit because I listen to hip hop mainly. So I grab her hand awkwardly and started to dance waltz with her. It was so fucking weird and bad and i don't know why I did that. I got her nuber when I asked for it but she didn't want to meet (who would have thought?). And this was only mildly autistic for my standards). So back to the story, the girl kissed me when we went(first kiss) to the club and later we held hands too. I got her number from a mutual friend because i forgot to ask her and we decided to watch the last episode of Game of Thrones at my place. Now the sex...first of all she was so tight it did hurt at the beginning(2 fingers did not fit easily in her). My problem is i did not feel it. I dont know what it is, my dick was not really hard and it really did not feel that good. I mean it did feel good but i thought it would feel much much better( I could not imagine fucking another dude so i don't think I'm gay) When I think back now 2 weeks prior to this I watched porn like 3 times a day and jacked off just because I could and was bored. After a week I then suddenly stopped watching porn and my libido is really low now. I get hard daily but i just dont feel the need to jack off, even after a week. And when i finally did jack off out of boredom it took me like 20 minutes( did it without porn just watching at my muscles in the mirror nohomo). So yea now im fucking scared that this might be permanent. 2 more things that bother me are that she didn't compliment at all. I wrote her good morning beautfifull girl, all she does write is good morning and goodnight but altleast everyday. I also complimented on her calves and said she has a broad back(holy fuck I actually might be gay and autistic). All she told me was you have weird knees (I mean they are weird but wtf?). The second thing is that I had no endurence, like I would thrust her for 30 seconds and then I needed a break. Do you guys have any advice to build up ''sex endurance''? She stayed until the next day and I have to say the best part for me was to have someone to cuddle with and to hold her. I don't know why im writing all this but I guess i just have to tell someone about this and I love you guys. Thanks for reading this bros and does anyone of you advice for me.

I am at peace finally with where I am in life and where I plan to go :) . This is mostly a personal post about my own short comings, however I think some of you guys might be able to relate in your own ways and take from this..\n\nSo the major problem I have had with women is that I look super young for my age. I look about 17 when I am 23. I am not ugly, but I do not have a built figure either. Skinny, not very muscular, super white with absolutely no tan or anything indicating I go outside. I spent so long wondering why I can't get girls so I spoke to a professional. A really great YouTube Dating Coach. We spoke back and forth with email and this is what he told me.\n\nHe told me that I have been dealt a group of cards in life and there is nothing I can do to change that hand of cards. No matter how hard I try I am stuck with them. So first thing first is to accept my set of cards. Just like someone who is in a bad accident and must use a wheelchair has to come to the conclusion that they will never walk like a normal person ever again no matter how bad they want to. So to accept my situation. \n\nSecond, I was told to do the best with what I have. He was very upfront telling me that being young looking as a guy my age is definitely going to be a deal breaker for a lot of women, also it will be hard for them to find me attractive.. But I must own it and make the best of it. It will be really really hard for me to get a girl right now, but that doesn't mean it is impossible, it just will take a lot of work and meeting a lot of different people. So even if worst case scenario I cannot get a girl to like me, what I can do is get my life straightened out during these years, and then when my time to shine comes (probably late 20's early 30's) I am going to have a kick ass stable life and age will finally start working for me not against me! \n\nMy problem is I wasn't accepting of reality. I was wanting things that just were not or maybe are not possible still at this time. But there is still so much for me to do! Now is the time to get my career locked down even better than it already is, get into great shape, keep learning and making my life even better and better. Also my problem was trying to get a 'girlfriend', when all this time I should have just been looking to make friends. Friends are something we all need for a healthy life. You don't even need many, but having friends will give you a reason to get out and keep bettering yourself and have positive encouragement and support when you are down. You don't need a girlfriend for that. \n\nLastly what did going to the mall teach me? Seeing all these guys with pretty girls should have got me depressed right? Wrong. I studied what made these men attractive to these girls. \"Why is that guy so different than me?\" Most of these guys were most importantly displaying a great level of confidence. They knew who they were and what they wanted. Two they were dressed well and groomed. Their hair wasn't all ridiculous like they went months without a haircut, and for the most part they were all physically fit looking. Were they 10/10's? I mean I am not gay to judge but they did not have perfect bodies. Some were slightly overweight. Some had some disproportionate parts of their body (we all do).. BUT their positive traits outweighed any negative significantly. \n\nSo instead of whining like a little bitch and being all depressed going to the mall alone seeing all these beautiful couples flaunting around, I actually learned from it and went away feeling better than when I got there! These are things I can improve! Sure I am still young looking and like I said above that is not an overnight fix, nor one that will happen in a year or two.. But every year it is going to get better and better. I am not going to give up on getting women now either believing one cannot like me, but I am shifting my goal into a mindset of meeting as many people as possible in general, not just meet a girl hoping she likes me. \n\nSide note: DAY 4! I haven't made it past day four in 3 years!

Think I have enough cash to last a while if I quit.  Undecided and a bit afraid of the what-ifs and unknowns.  You only live once.  What do?\n\nFirst line engineering manager at very large company.  We are in major cost cutting mode, IMO we aren't innovative anymore, we are handcuffed by bureaucracy and politics, we are bloated, and I hate it.  Despite this, they've been very good to me over the years.  They paid for my MBA and they paid for a bachelors in Computer Science that I'll finish in June (I did it for kicks/as a hobby in my spare time and I'm finishing with a 4.0).  I also have another Engineering degree which is directly related to what my company does (not software).  I left this company once before and was hired back when I asked to come back.  I understand \"grass is greener syndrome\" as I've been there and done that.   We are downsizing quite a bit this year and I'm being offered the \"opportunity\" to take a voluntary layoff.  To be clear, damn near everyone is being offered this opportunity so it's not a reflection of my performance.  I'm trying to decide whether or not to take it and this decision is about more than money.\n\nCurrent base is in the low $140k range.  Bonus is nominally 10% (based on company performance) with slight upper/lower based on personal performance.  No equity compensation.  401k match is very good, plus they put in a fixed percentage whether I contribute or not.  Near zero insurance premiums for a high deductible policy.  I have 17 days of vacation, 10 days of sick leave, and many paid holidays.\n\nI have probably $2500 in an HSA, $10k in a ROTH IRA, and about $177k in my 401(k).  One car paid off.  Another car with a payment.  I owe about $355k on a house I could sell for about $570k based on recent comps.  I have $35k in cash.  Zero credit card debt.  My monthly expenses are in the $4500 range.  I've verified that I'll be coded as \"layoff\" for unemployment reasons and I can collect the max of $2500 per month unemployment in my state for up to 6 months.  \n\nI have a wife (she doesn't work but she could if she needed to) and a family.  I'm 40 years old.\n\nThe severance isn't great.  1 week of salary for every year of service.  Add in the payoff of unused vacation and I'll gross about $35k (I realize it will be subject to 25% lump sump withholding).  My last day on the job would be the end of June.  By then I'll be finished with my Computer Science degree.  My company will pay for my COBRA through the end of September.\n\nI live in an expensive city with a red hot real estate market and red hot tech industry.  My county is one of the fastest growing in the nation.\n\nBy my math I could probably last about a year before I really started hurting for money.  More if my wife took a job.  I feel like in my city with 2 technical degrees (engineering and computer science) plus my MBA I should be able to find work pretty quickly.  Could probably get a software engineer job pretty quick especially if I had full time at home to prepare for interviews.  I'd be willing to take a project manager type job.  But I don't really want to be in management anymore.\n\nNot that I want to go back to work quickly.  I'd love to have July and August off with my kids and go back to work when they go back to school (after Labor Day).  Of course I realize I'll go back whenever I find something.  I'm not concerned with making the same amount of money.  I'm more concerned with being happy.  I'm getting older and if I don't jump now I'm a bit worried about age discrimination 10 years from now.\n\nI realize I've been rambling a bit but I'm looking for the \"what am I not considering\" type items.  Thanks for reading.\n\n\n\n","distinguished":null,"archived":false,"is_self":true,"retrieved_on":1492477468,"contest_mode":false,"gilded":0,"author":"[deleted]","id":"62plvy","hide_score":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"hidden":false,"score":22}

I am very active and overall healthy despite being overweight: Low blood pressure, not diabetic, never smoked, normally no issues until recently.\n\n**Here's my situation:**\n\nSaturday morning I woke feeling mildly nauseated and suffering from constant sulphur burps. By early evening it had escalated to full-blown diarrhea with mild vomiting (mostly just from gagging due to the sulphur burps) and painful stomach bloating. Despite drinking as much water as possible (which went right through me) I became so dehydrated I ended up being kept overnight at the ER on a saline IV. They ran tests ranging from blood work (which all came back clear) to x-rays and a CT scan. All they could determine was that the lymph nodes in my gastrointestinal region were swollen (which was causing the diarrhea) and that my stomach itself was enormous (despite a day of diarrhea and vomiting) but they had no explanation of what was causing it. No fever. All tests for various viruses were negative. No sign of any infection. No sign of a blockage. Nothing. Two days later and I was fine again. \n\n**The kicker? This had happened three weeks earlier too!**\n\nAnd it was the exact same symptoms in the exact same pattern hitting me in the exact same order. The first time they assumed it was a virus and sent me home after basic blood work and a CT scan. The second time I had the exact same doctor (luck of the draw!) and he was convinced it wasn't virus related. Especially after the new tests had identical results: Nothing. I was refered to a gastroenterologist who thoroughly questioned all of my recent activities, diet, family history and reviewed the test results from both ER visits. She also agreed it didn't sound like a virus but had no idea what it could be and scheduled me for some very uncomfortable tests (one where I eat a specific diet for 24 hours before breathing into little glass vials every 20 minutes for several hours and another where I go to the hospital, eat irradiated food and spend 4 hours being tested to see how my body processes it).  \n\n**Here's my question though: Is there any chance this could be a cashew nut allergy?**\n\nThe only thing that changed in my routine prior to both \"episodes\" was that I had a milkshake the night before that had cashew nuts in it. Both times! I hadn't had cashews in YEARS prior to that but had never had any issue with them wayback when so I had no reason to suspect them. And I've had shakes at the same local business numerous times without cashews and never had an issue. But I have a hard time imagining it was a coincidence. Both doctors said a nut allergy would involve a rash though. I don't have a rash... or a general \"nut allergy\"! I have four kids so I eat peanut butter every other day without issue. So I guess they're right... but I thought I might ask a larger audience in case anyone else has heard otherwise. I return to the gastroenterologist in mid may to learn the results of the new tests but I can't put the cashew concern out of my mind. Thoughts? I'm almost tempted to buy a handful and be my own guinea pig... but anyone who has ever had a gastrointestinal attack understands why I can't convince myself to do it. Lol!","permalink":"/r/AskDocs/comments/62ppge/can_a_cashew_nut_allergy_cause_gastrointestinal/"}

Not looking for advice per say, but words of encouragement would do. I\nI am 17 years old and a junior in high school. And I'm \"gasp\" gay. I grew up in a religious household, so I didn't have the word for what I was feeling until I was 13. Of why I found my friend attractive and felt funny only around them. Well I realized well when it came down to well u know preference in mind. When I realized, For two years after I tried being straight, dating women the whole thing. Never felt anything with women no matter how hard I tried. I knew when I fell head over heels for this sexy beautiful dreamboat guy (doesn't know to this day) and I knew it was real. I've been through much bullshit in my life. I'm also barely six months removed from a suicide attempt that still haunts me. It happened on September 25th 2016 and was a big wake up call. I lied my ass off in the hospital saying I only took Tylenol and had a bad reaction to it when in reality I overdosed and the amount I took it is a miracle I am typing this. I was so ashamed. I felt like I had failed everyone. I never told anyone other than my closest friends bc I felt so ashamed. My parents also are very homophobic. My dad and mom equally but mom is ten times more extreme. Like threatening to send me to a \"Christian\" counselor who specializes in \"homosexual inclinations\" and amend me as a man homophobic. I've never come out to them, sure I had the temptation to play I'm coming out followed by it's raining men followed by chains of love to get the message across, oh man I can imagine but well that wouldn't work out \ud83d\ude02 but back in January my dad borrowed my laptop for a second and signed into his chrome on my laptop, and by tech magic my bookmarks and passwords backed up to his account. My mom went ballistic when she found out, didn't confront me until she walked in to thinking I was well doing what every teenage boy does gay or straight when in fact I wasn't She told me to come to room. she said for me to give her my laptop and phone so she can look through the history. she then went on saying i have to keep closing that box and seeking women with the whole heart and that my destiny is to get married to a woman and have little boys and girls and that i need to stop looking at homosexual propaganda and that she looked through my history and saying i have to stop seeking that and once i open the boxx ill never be able to get ti out. Then ended with we are going to keep talking about this. I found out how with my laptop. Since I'm smart with technology, I deleted all my bookmarks and passwords on my dads account. I also felt since they are snooping on me I'll snoop on them. Well, that's where I was heartbroken. She wants me to stay home. Not live on my own. Not have me move out at eighteen. Thinks I'm going through a rebellion. Wants me to stay home and only go to community college. Says it breaks her heart I'm like this. Have a intervention on my homosexuality. Get my grandparents and priest possibly in it too. Not just that, there's money stuff I won't go into detail in public, but that money I'll have when I'm 18 and I'm going to use that money to get the fuck out of my hellhole and live freely. I'm trying so hard to hang in there, everyday I've felt like it would be ok if I just died because my moms image would be boosted. Ever since January, I've been on high alert. Been encrypting everything, long passwords on everything. I've had much anger hurt and resentment towards my mother ever since September when she started the homophobic speeches, which pushed me over the edge. My mom and mes relationship I think is irrepairable. She's hurt me and cut me so much inside. She's why I have thoughts of maybe I'm a abomination. I'm trying though. Music is life, so is poetry, and everyday I try to find something to live for. I've been fighting like hell to stay alive and as one of my friends has said to me \"you are a light don't let your light burn out\". I have a support network, and I have been basically rebuilding my life ever since my attempt. \nI know I'm young, but even tho I have shit myself, apparently ppl think I am a good advice giver how ironic.

But I feel it was one of my best posts, so I want to repost it on here and maybe even see if I get any new insite. So sorry if you've already seen this. And thank you to anyone who chooses to read the whole thing. ]\n\n\nI mean, this was hell. He stole from me, lied ab just ab everything, hid his H from me, until I found out (which didn't take long at all...) &amp; then that's when it just imploded. He was completely dependent to the point the withdrawals led to drinking which led to detox which led to suboxone therapy which things actually for a slight small moment started to get better, and then I found out he lost his job..... An amazing one I might add. He's so smart, has a Masters degree!! He's not some lowlife guy who never graduated HS (and I'm not bashing the people who haven't btw, so please no focusing on that.) - (And I know he's already going to use \"for fun at times\" again, but has told me it'll be under control this time........and because I'd be the one administering / control it..) -_- Anyway.  (Oh and he's also a recovering alcoholic, which is what tipped the edge over (this time) into detox). \n\nNot many know how it feels to literally watch your significant other, who you love more than ANYTHING, have done just about everything you could possibly do for them, deteriorate in front of your eyes and there's nothing you can do about it. Absolutely nothing. They chose this drug over you MULTIPLE times. It feels like all the time - because it basically is. I just can't even begin to describe how that makes someone feel. \n\nNow - I'll let you in on something. I'm a drug user myself - in fact, I love them! The only difference between me and my SO is I have the ability to stop or only use as needed / wanted and be fine &amp; he doesn't. So the fucked up thing, is he does all these horrible things to me and puts me through hell for months, steals from me, lies to me - oh mannnn did he lie to me - I stick around because I love him and know who he's who I'm supposed to be with (I'm 28 and he's 35), so we're not some young kids. And I'm devastated watching this. But on the other end of me wanting him to be clean, I want to keep recreationally using. But that's not fair, is it?\n\nI shouldn't have any right to get mad when he talks about using or want to use when I'm supposed to be his support system of staying clean.....when I want to use. BUT I DO! And the fucked up this is, right now, when times have been tougher than EVER before - and I need to be there for him and supportive and obviously sober - I want to just get constantly 'gone'.  I don't wanna deal with anything. I want to escape. (Quick side note - I can't take opioids because I'm allergic and get violently ill that I never could even get close to getting any type of \"high\"'off of them - so more my style of using is weed, Benzo's, mdma, 5-APB, etc. but on the other end, MDMA or any drug relating any of those effects won't work on him bc he's on SSRI's - so we're on complete opposite ends of what we can take - which is why him using is a big deal to me bc it's only stuffy that will get him hooked again, he can't take the 'fun drugs' - but I can......) but back to the story. \n\nBut how can I talk about wanting to escape and take all these drugs and still get mad at my bf when he says the same thing? I know it's fucked up. Idk.

So fucked ...Anyways I just had to type that out. So if you read this, you're awesome. And any thoughts or comments are welcomed.\n\nPS: I wish no one could get addicted to drugs and we could all just get fucked up randomly together and never have to worry about getting hooked. That would be awesome. Ok I'm done. \n\n\n\nEdit: the good job he lost was over 100k, so when I say he had it good / good things going for him...I wasn't kidding..\n\n2nd Edit: I caught him about to shoot up, when he told me he'd never even think about doing that (only sticking to snorting) and then come to find out it's been multiple times before that. Oh. And still no job. I love this man but FUCK am I wearing thin...I'm almost getting to the point where I don't care...I'm not there yet, but I can tell I'm getting close. I'm tired of crying. I'm tired of wondering if he's lying. I'm tried of wondering why I let this keep going on. I'm just tired. Rant over.....maybe.

I will never forget the memories that we have made on the field training exercises, he has been the only person I've trusted beside my family. He has always been sort of effeminate so most of school he was bullied, that stopped as soon as I seen it happen. The beginning of my grade 10 year probably shaped me for the rest of my life,so I met this girl, we exchanged numbers and began the relationshit. After 7 months of dating I had the opportunity to help my dad out of town for a couple of weeks, which is when the dirty deed occurred. I found out by him drunk apologizing to me, so the next day I confronted her, she laughed about it to my face. I've told this story to maybe 4 people, I'm not in the habit of opening myself so describing this situation lacks some of the more depressing features I would rather not discuss.

Here is my basic info, budget, and what I'm looking for\n\nIncome= 70-80k (depends on overtime)\n \n401k= 10k (I contribute 5% and get 5% match)\n\nRoth IRA= 7k\n\nSavings account= 10k\n\nFully funded Emergency fund (8k) I realize this is a little low, reason is because if I did lose my job I can switch from being a part time online student to full time almost immediately and would have a 2k a month housing stipend available from the GI bill available monthly within 30 days. \n\nStocks in individual brokerage (9K) \n\nFICO score= 723\n\nDTI=3% (currently live at home reason its almost zero)\n\nCar is paid off and worth 6k on KBB\n\nMonthly debts are Phone=100 Car insurance=75 Gas=135 Groceries=150 \n\nAfter 401k, health, disability, taxes my net pay check is between 1750 and 2230 based on overtime which is regularly available and I get paid Bi-weekly.\n\nHome location will be sw suburbs of Chicago. Looking for a home that doesn't need any major work (carpet and painting walls, etc is fine)   170-210k gets a pretty nice starter home. 3bd, 1-1.5bthr, 1000-1500sqft \n\nI have been pre-approved for a Va home loan at 215k although I wanna try and buy under 200k I will be putting zero down. My realtor has experience with the VA loan and says I can more than likely get a seller to cover most, if not all closing cost.\n\nNo debt at all. Pay off credit cards in full every month and no car payment. \n\nMy main question is, has anyone used a VA home loan before and are there any tips or advice to know before making an offer and going through the process? Did the seller agree to cover closing cost? How long did it take to close (i hear a va can take 15-25 days longer than conventional)?\n\nI know this sub is pretty conservative, does anyone think I should wait and build up more of a savings, or do I have the blessing of the ultra fiscally conservative redditers?","permalink":"/r/personalfinance/comments/62q06y/ready_for_first_house_va_loan/","distinguished":null,"spoiler":false,"media_embed":{},"edited":1491013883,"author_flair_css_class":null,"hide_score":false,"author":"mar3ware","id":"62q06y","media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","secure_media_embed":{},"score":1,"hidden":false,"archived":false,"retrieved_on":1492477722,"is_self":true,"contest_mode":false,"gilded":0}

Currently at 173 with a goal of 165. I'm 5.7\" and just hit 40 (you can tell by my greys:))  So after a few years of being well and truly obese something had to give and luckily i found keto through the Joe Rogan podcast. I thought hey it cant hurt to try and the foods sound like this is something i could do and stick to.. I don't think i'll ever go back to eating the way i was before.\n\nA couple of side by sides. The fat guy shots were taken when i visited beautiful America 2 years ago (i'm from Australia, the shot with the .50 is from my Vegas leg of the trip). The afters were taken about 20 minutes ago after buying some new size 32 jeans... like WTF size 32.... I have hardly any photos when i was a fat guy, i just avoided the camera so much but it was hard to avoid when i was on a trip of a life time to the USA. These were really the only shots i could find.\n\nPics: http://imgur.com/a/o48Ow \n\nThanks for all the info on here guys and the pics which really keep you motivated :)\n\nEdit: I gotta say too, keto has genuinely changed my life. You'll notice in the leaner shots i look more tanned (while we did just go through summer here.. a bloody hot one too), this is because when i was obese i didn't want to leave the house. I was fat and depressed, i had horrible clothes that didn't fit and i just felt terrible about myself. I basically became a hermit. I also had terrible sleeping habits where i'd sleep for 4-5 hours a night, never at the same time, i'd get to sleep at dawn and wake up at all hours of the day and just felt generally terrible all the time. I was grumpy, sleepless, fat and depressed. I now get bang on 8 hours sleep a night and dont even need and alarm, i'm up before the sun comes up and i'm just so much more happier and way more motivated. \n\nMy partner did this with me and she looks amazing now and i know she feels so much better too.\n\nKeto changed my life.","thumbnail":"self"}

They're the mtnglo variant in both cases.\n\n\nMeasurements are in inches, from the inside of the staked tents without the fly.\n\n\nUL1: L 86, W (head) 39.5, W (shoulder) 35, W (mid) 32.5, W (foot) 30, HT (shoulder) 34.5 HT (mid) 37.5\n\nHV:  L 84, W (head) 36.5, W (shoulder) 32, W (mid) 28, W (foot) 26, HT (shoulder) 37 HT (mid) 40.5\n\n\nThe HV feels airier when you're sitting up, and there's definitely more headroom. The head wall and footbox area are more vertical, and even with the shorter length there's a little more room for your toes.\n\n\nHowever... there's significantly more elbow room in the original. It feels much roomier when you're laying down because of the extra width.  I'm 5'10\", and the extra headroom is less important to me, so I'm returning the HV UL1. Had they not made the tent narrower, I would've gone with the HV. \n\n\nOther observations: I also prefer the taffeta arrangement on the sidewalls of the original... on the HV it stops before it gets to the footbox. I'd rather just have it continue, as on the original. The mesh on the original is dark gray... much better than the white mesh of the HV. The HV does have the D-door, a plus, but not sure how I feel about the 2 zippers required to open the door. The HV also has velcro loops to attach the fly to the poles where the head-end guyouts are. This is something I prefer. \n\n\nHope this helps anyone who is looking at these.\n","permalink":"/r/CampingGear/comments/62q862/a_comparison_of_the_ba_copper_spur_ul1_and_hv_ul1/","thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null}

{"distinguished":null,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/62qa3z/i_23m_want_to_ask_my_coworker_21f_out_but_i_dont/","selftext":"I have lately been having feelings for my one coworker. Her and I have been friends since I started working there about 2 years ago, and now I think I want to be more than just friends. However, I just don't really know how to do it, or if I should risk the friendship over it.\n\nI want to add a little bit about myself first. I am 23 and never really had a relationship before.  I have a problem with social anxiety and depression, which heavily contributed to my lack of relationships in the past, but they are more controlled now, thanks to counselling and medication. I'm not completely free of my issues, but I have much better control of them now. Still, though, they have kind of shaped me into a more introverted and reserved person than I would have liked to be. Not sure if this info will help at all, but just thought I'd add a little insight.\n\nWhen I started working at this job, this coworker I am interested in immediately caught my eye as the most attractive one there. Originally, I had this mindset that dating coworkers was playing with fire, so I tried to steer clear of her in all honesty. As the months went on, though, I had worked with her quite a bit and we had gotten along well. We started to spend our breaks together when our schedules allowed, and at that point I was starting to like her more, but as a friend. We even go out of our ways to say hi to each other from time to time. However, it wasn't until a few weeks ago that I started having feelings for her. It was a bit of a timing thing, I guess. She was always the type that couldn't go without a boyfriend, and she has been single for a few months now, so I started to think that maybe this would be a good time to approach her, too. \n\nHere's where the uncertainty lies:\n\n- I am not at all sure if she is interested in me or not. I am awful at picking up cues, so if she is giving any, I'm not seeing them. I have also thought that she is \"out of my league,\" and that I already have no chance whatsoever. \n\n- Since we are friends, I don't know how to ask her in a way that isn't going to catch her off guard. I have been trying to drop some hints by, unsuccessfully, asking her to hang out twice in the past few weeks , but in a friendly \"hey you want to do something\" kind of manner. Even though she turned down my offers (was busy, was going out of town), I haven't noticed her trying to kind of back away from me. If anything, she seems to be friendlier, unless that is just my mind playing tricks on me. \n\n- We don't really have any interactions outside of work. Occasionally I will message her on Facebook or comment on a tweet and the like, but we don't text or anything.\n\n- I am not sure if I should risk the friendship over it. I like having her around. Seeing her brightens up my day. I don't want to turn that into a negative if I don't have to. I feel like this could be a trigger for my depression that I alluded to earlier. \n\n- Do I really want to mess around with workplace relationships? This is something I really just have no clue about, so I'm wondering if anybody has any experience with that. I like my job, or should I say, I don't hate it enough that I am willing to look for something else, so I don't really know if I want to screw anything up with that.\n\n- She has kind of a flirty personality. I don't really know how to interpret her friendliness or anything, really.\n\n- I don't take rejection very well. It is a trigger for my depression.\n\n\nDespite my uncertainty, I am tired of being single. It's been a trigger for my depression as of late, and to be honest, I get a bit depressed thinking about having another failed attempt at a relationship. I worry that I would regret not asking her out in the first place, or regret screwing up our friendship. I have been thinking about her ALOT lately, which is making me think I should just go for it.  I really just don't have a clue what to do from here. \n\nSorry if this is a little jumbled or just seems lame. I really don't know what to do.\n\nTL;DR: I have feelings for a friend/coworker. I do not know how to approach her, if at all, in a way that won't ruining our friendship, job, or affect my depression.","thumbnail":"self","media_embed":{},"edited":1491017310,"spoiler":false,"score":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"hidden":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","media":null,"author":"coworker4018","id":"62qa3z","hide_score":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"contest_mode":false,"is_self":true,"retrieved_on":1492477891,"archived":false,"title":"I [23/M] want to ask my coworker [21/F] out, but I don't know how to do it or if I even should","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":1491016964,"over_18":false,"num_comments":1,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationships","domain":"self.relationships","link_flair_text":"Dating","quarantine":false,"suggested_sort":"confidence","secure_media":null,"brand_safe":true,"link_flair_css_class":"m-yw dating","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/62qa3z/i_23m_want_to_ask_my_coworker_21f_out_but_i_dont/"}

I want to get a job (hopefully I can get work study next year with the 2017/2018 FAFSA) but I don't know where to begin. My school is very competitive, their med school even more so, so I need to get into a professor's biology lab or any kind of research lab to even think about competing with other students. I want to get a research position, but I also need to make money (so I can pay for my own things and help pay for college a bit). I don't have a car as of now, but I can get free transportation from my school.\nLuckily, my school has their own website where you can post your resume and apply for jobs there, but it's hard for me to get motivated as I am very depressed.\nI don't know where to begin to even start looking for a job (the type of job I should get, if I should do it over the summer, ect).\nAlso, I am also unsure of if a credit or a debit card is better, as I've never had one. \n\nTLDR; I want to get a job (but also need a research position at my school) but my depression is getting in the way and I don't know where to start.
