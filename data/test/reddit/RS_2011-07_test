I usually add 500-1000 meters every week.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yoga is often limited to 20-40 minutes each morning due to needing to be on time for work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kung Fu is attended 2-4 times per week depending on mental stamina.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the future weights may need to be split into three days (Back/Chest/Legs) as opposed to (Upper Body/Lower Body) as I able to handle more.

Also how is an elliptical machine for cardio?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any help is greatly appreciated.  I know right now I&amp;#39;m all talk.  I hope to be back on Halloween with results though.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re curious as to how big I am here&amp;#39;s a picture of me at 350, I am 6&amp;#39;4&amp;quot;: &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/OCjFc.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/OCjFc.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  one interesting thing to note about this picture is about a month prior I had a horrible back injury.

I still eat mainly ham sandwiches, fiber bars, and slim fast... except now that I've moved back home there is a proper dinner mixed in with that.\n\nFor almost a year now I've been able to maintain my weight loss.

I could be doing the HIIT right now but I want to try weightlifting this time... don't get me wrong I have every intention on doing cardio... just weights first.\n\nMy personal goal is to be under 250 by Halloween... even if its 249.99~.

Not just any bad luck, but the kind of bad luck that comes from a) either trying to be a good person and help people out or b) the kind of stupidity that can only result from people taking advantage of you. \n\nAbout three months ago, we opened our house to a 19-year-old girl who, along with her mother, made a verbal agreement to pay 1/3rd of the bills in exchange for living in the smaller bedroom. She was very excited and \"needed\" to move out of her mother's house. \n\nUnfortunately, this girl and her mother conned us for all we had. Being unemployed undergraduate students, we didn't have any money put aside for \"extras\" in the first place, and this girl failed to pay half of her rent for April, all of her rent for June, and all of her rent (plus a late fee!) for July, even after setting up a \"payment plan\" with apartment management with the expectation of paying it. She has since moved out, but not after stealing all of our food, some of our possessions, and most of our dignity. \n\nApartment management refuses to accept that this girl still has a legal obligation for her portion of the rent as she has NOT been signed off the lease, and consequently, I have been forced to pay her rent for the last three months. She owes me nearly 700 dollars, and though I have taken her to the DA for the bad check she's written me, there is a high possibility that I will not be able to afford fees for small claims court to claim anything other than the 250 dollar check she wrote me, with intentional fraud. \n\nShe still has two keys to our apartment, so we barricade the door every night because we're afraid she will come back and steal more of our food or belongings. \n\nEvery word this girl has told us is a lie and she has robbed our home of happiness, trust, and most of all, security. We were very nearly evicted last month because of her lies (she waited until the 22nd to \"pay\" her rent and when I'd gone in the next morning to make sure she had, she had not. I was stuck paying it or being evicted.) And now, because of having to pay her rent for the last three months, I may end up evicted within the next few weeks because I do not have enough money to make it. \n\nMy parents have offered to help as much as they can, but frankly, I'm 22 years old and I feel like a loser for living off of my parents when I've been somewhat independent for the last year.\n\nMy history is about as bleak: I was homeless over Christmas the last few years, I lived with my sister after that while taking out nearly 10,000 dollars in student loans just for living expenses. The idea that I will be paying off these last three years of my life for the next 50 is sickening to me. I have not been able to go grocery shopping in the last three months; our food reserves are down to nothing because of our roommate's dishonesty and stealing, and we really have no food left. Recently, I was in a vehicle accident that left me with a large gash in my hand and a damaged tendon, and over 1,000 dollars in ER bills which I am unable to pay.\n\nI have applied for assistance and food stamps, but have been denied because I am a student, and my current job which I just picked up at Hometown Buffet (seriously probably the worst job I've ever had) will not consistently give me 20 hours a week, despite having promised me 40 hour weeks when they hired me. This week, I have been awarded six hours of undeniable hell, and yet I have tried to be the best employee I can be because, well, I consider myself lucky I even have a job. \n\nIn August, I may be able to receive food stamps due to being a federal work-study recipient, but that is only if I can find a work-study job, which is very limited. I do not know that my income will continue to support my rent or bills, let alone my boyfriend (who is STILL unemployed, I've come to learn that our town/state both have DOUBLE the unemployment rates of most other towns/states.) and because I am not yet 24, my parents are expected to contribute 10,000 dollars yearly to my education and I may not even be able to attend college because they simply cannot give me that kind of money. As it is, the help they are offering me at the moment is limited and I feel guilty that they even think they can manage to support themselves and me. \n\nThe financial aid and government assistance system simply does not take people like me into account. I try hard, I love fiercely, and I am responsible. I am not getting married to cheat the financial aid system. I am not getting pregnant in order to receive welfare or food stamps or WIC. I am two years away from a Bachelor's degree in a field where I will probably have to relocate thousands of miles away from my hometown simply to find work. I get great grades, I never miss work or a class, and yet... I can't do it on my own. \n\nJust recently, I've learned that I have diabetes because I have not been able to afford nutritious food or been able to eat more than once a day, causing my insulin production to skyrocket. I spend a large portion of my days, when not working, asleep because high blood sugar levels and hunger cause me to feel incredibly weak. I don't have medical insurance to help me through this at the moment, because the Medi-cal budget is being cut and my paperwork is still in the processing stage following my accident last month. \n\nIt is the first of July, and I know someone who is diabetic should not be asking for pizza, but dammit, I'm hungry and my boyfriend's birthday was two days ago, and I haven't been able to give him anything. I don't know what I can offer in prove aside from pictures of my puppy-dog stare, empty pantry, and medical bills, but really, I just want a freakin' pizza and the inevitable food-coma that will come afterwards. \n\nWith vegetables on it. I've learned, as a child you never want to eat your vegetables, as an adult who cant afford food, you miss them more than anything. \n\nBy the way: this website gives me so much hope, I could burst. I spent hours yesterday and today reading posts before I even signed up for a name and got the balls to make one myself. &lt;3 \n\nEDIT: I am going to school for graphic design, I don't know much about reddit yet but if you want a graphic made for you to display, I'd be happy to do it in a repayment of faith and support for RAOP members. :) ","domain":"self.Random_Acts_Of_Pizza","num_comments":17,"likes":null,"clicked":false,"thumbnail":"self","saved":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s7wq","ups":3,"approved_by":null,"score":1,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have bad luck.

A couple weeks ago, i met this girl while out at the bars with some friends (she works with one of my friends).  We hit it off really well, and I decided to ask her on a date.  Now, my last serious relationship was in high school, and though I've \"dated\" a few girls since in college, I will admit I had never really asked a girl on a date.  \n\nAnyway, she accepts.  Because we both work a lot and live half an hour apart, we agreed on a lunch date one day.  I think it went well.  We went out for lunch, but hung out even more after.  We talked about ex's and what we would ideally want in a relationship.  This seemed a bit weird at first, but it was good and we seemed to agree on some major things, like how important it is not to have jealousy.  At the end she said she had a lot of fun, and we agreed to hang out some more.  A few days later, I happened to be in her area (she's in the city, I'm in the suburbs), and we decided to hang out.  She had to work, so it ended up just being like an hour as we went out for coffee.  Nonetheless, it was great.  She had been stressed out from work and summer classes and said she was glad I came to take her mind off of things.  She said she really liked hanging out with me, and we talked about, with our busy schedules, planning a day to do something, like going hiking or to an amusement park.  \n\nThis all sounds great, but like most 21 year old guys I overthink things, and also am vastly inexperienced when it comes to this stuff.  That last date (if it even is that) was more than a week ago.  We've pretty much done all our communicating through texting, and sometimes it's hours or a day between texts, I assume just because she works so much.  She does seem like she still does wants to hang out.  For example, the last two thursday nights, she has gone out with friends and invited me to come along, but both times I was working that night and/or had a test in my summer class the next morning.  Finally this week I was open Thursday, but she had other plans.  Basically, it seems like whenever she is open to hang out, I'm busy, and vice versa.  \n\nHere's **my question** (sorry it's taken so long to get to it):  should I be trying harder to set something up?  I guess I'm afraid of seeming too desperate, and flooding her with a bunch of texts, although I have a feeling she is waiting for me to try harder to figure out something.  I should probably call her instead of texting, but for some reason I felt like because she is so busy, texting is better.  I will also mention that it looks like I might be transferring somewhere else in the fall about 3 hours away, so I'm a bit hesitant to get too serious and she may feel the same way.  I really like this girl though.  Any advice would be wonderful!

It lasted a couple years. I didn't know what was going on. My mom would cry every morning. I remember being in awe of how gorgeous she was. Trust me, she was pin-up beautiful. She still is.

We both had a mutual friend that introduced us.  After a few weeks of hanging out, we began dating.  I should have seen the red flags, but of course, love blinds you sometimes.  He was 23 with no car, and no DL.  He was very secretive about his family and why he was living in a different state than he was born and raised in.  He has always been kind of a sexual deviant.  He would holler and whoop at any woman that walked by(before he was in a relationship with me. He stopped doing that once we began dating).  His friends would tell me of his stories and some of them were pretty extreme in my eyes.(Like making a porn and putting it online; \"accidentally\" hurting his last girlfriend so bad she had to go to the hospital(anal sex without her being ready for it, or so I'm told).\n\nWell, when we first began dating, I asked him why he didn't have a DL.  He told me it was because when he was younger and first got his license that he just couldn't control himself and he sped and drove dangerously.  He explained that he felt that by not having a DL or a car, that he could just keep himself out of trouble.  A part of me thought that it was a strange reason, but another part of me thought \"well, at least he is being responsible\".  \n\nSo here is where the problem comes in.  We have lived together for about 4 months now, and we are still unpacking some box of his that weren't of the most importance.  He was having me go through his boxes and he had one full of binders and paperwork.  I started to take the lid off the box and he full out flipped out on me.  He wrenched it from my hands and put it back on the box and yelled at me for opening that one.  I asked him what all the paperwork was, and he just kept telling me that it was very personal and that I didn't need to know.  I dropped it then, but the next day at work(yesterday) my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to Google his name.  What I found was very disturbing.  The very first thing was his name on the state wanted sex offender registry. \n\nI read through his profile and found that he had been found guilty on a charge of aggravated sexual abuse and incest. He was 11 or so when it happened. Not only was he a registered sex offender, but he was on the wanted list for failing to register.  When I got home yesterday, I confronted him about it. He broke down and told me everything.  The real reason he didn't have DL was because he fled his homestate(where the offences took place) and moved to our state and if he tried to apply for a new DL, they would find him.  He also explained what the charges were about, and it made me sick to my stomach.  He ended up in a treatment center until he was 18.  That is why there was no real story about his teenage years that I knew of.  \n\nSupposedly, he was going to tell me eventually, but when?  We have already been together for so long, but I feel completely cheated.  Now I am emotionally invested in this man, but I don't know if I can cope with his past choices.  What if we have children? I don't think I could ever fully trust him with my children.  If something happened to them, I would never forgive myself for allowing it to happen.  He claims he never told me earlier because he know I would leave. Well duh!\n\nI don't know what to do.  Should I leave him? Should I stay? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nEDIT:  I searched online for his criminal record and found 3 DUI charges from when he was 18-20. There were no other charges for any kind of sexual crimes.  \n\nUPDATE: I moved all of my stuff out on Friday while he was at work and stayed with his family all weekend. He blew up my phone for three days and ended up showing up at his family's place to confront me.  Since he showed up, I felt no remorse in letting them all know exactly why I left.

I'm a bit stoked to have this done.  I'm in New Paltz NY, any recommended artists I should look out for?  Or signs I should keep a look out for which would indicate I should maybe skip over a shop?  I really want a super clean look, nice clean lines, probably any shading might be unnecessary, just something straight forward and awesome.

I'm 28 years old and have been married to my wife for 3 years and together for 8. We are expecting our first child any day now and we are both super excited. However, in addition to my extreme anticipation of becoming a dad...I'm also starting to freak out. Not so much about being a father but rather all of the new financial responsibility. I know this is something that every man thinks of, or any parent for that matter but I feel like someone here may have some ideas to help alleviate at least some of the stress.\n\nLet me give a little insight into my situation. I currently work as an IT manager at a manufacturing and fabrication facility.

If so how much weight do you need?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1309527575,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

My brain is going haywire. I know I need help, but I'm honestly not sure if I'm ready to go through that again. I'll elaborate more later, but I just can't bring myself to care enough yet. I hope this is enough of a step for me to start walking.\n\nThanks for the concern you've shown by even bothering to open this.\n\nEdit for some detail: I'm 19 now. 4 or 5 years ago I was diagnosed with Clinical Depression after a long string of SI and an attempt. I was put on Lexapro (an SSRI), which stayed consistent for the next 3-4 years, despite me never really knowing if it made a difference. After a while, my psychiatrist brought my parents in for a talk-about-me session and told /them/ that I had a lot of symptoms of bipolar (no mania, so I assume type II, but can't truly be certain). \n\nI was put on a mood stabilizer then, Abilify, I believe. I continued therapy and medication, not really noticing any difference, except for a few side effects from the Abilify, however I had never been informed what to expect or if I was supposed to be able to tell if something was working (I to this day do not know, so... It's left a bad taste in my mouth). \n\nAfter a year or two, I started sinking back down again, so my psych prescribed another stabilizer, Wellbutrin. I was on Wellbutrin for 3 days, during which I had a continuous, massive panic attack. I felt that if I stopped moving, I would die. My mother described those three days to me as being more frightening than when I was laying in the hospital with my eyes so dilated my iris wasn't visible after attempting to OD. Switched that out for Lamictil, which I also couldn't really tell if it did anything. All this was happening during high school. Towards winter of my senior year, I crashed. Hard. I fairly often have a downswinging mood, but, as with most people, I get triggered and it makes it significantly worse. I ran into some problems and figured I'd just end it. Ended up taking too many pills and threw up, mom checked on me, ambulance, yaddayadda. I was decently good to myself through the end of Senior year. I got a new therapist who was much more on my level and I was doing okay, even after I stopped taking meds (with the doctor's permission).\n\nI was all set up to go to college, had gone to orientation and picked out my classes and just couldn't do it. So I backed out. My parents were furious so I ended up moving out. They moved completely just a few months after that (we'd gotten things straightened out). I had a great year away from everything, just working, hanging out with my best friends in the world, generally being in love. I struggled every now and then, but I hadn't (and haven't) SIed in... Almost a year now. Which is huge for me.\n\nSo now I'm back at my parent's, in a city I haven't lived in or near for 10 years, knowing basically no one and getting ready for school. I feel like I'm losing myself. I feel like everyone from my life is disappearing and, no matter what I do to try to hang on, they'll all slip away. No matter what they say to reassure me, I just feel alone and unloved. I've been bursting at the seams with tears, but they only fall 1 or 2, so I don't even get the relief of crying. I know I should find a therapist and a psych but... I don't know if I'm ready for help. I don't know if I'm strong enough to do all this again. I know it's bad, but I never fully opened up to my medical help, because I've always been secretly ashamed of having a mental disorder. I don't hide it. I don't tell everyone, but I don't hide it. I just wish I was normal. I wish I could have an even mood. I wish I didn't have someone else in my head occasionally (that's something I have yet to share with a professional). I wish I could trust people and not see them walking out on me, because I don't understand why they care. \n\nWhat I think is worst is that, rationally, I know I'm wrong. I know that I'm a relatively bright, young male about to go to a great school and hopefully do something positive with his life. I know that my fiancee loves me with her entire being and, despite the problems we've had, has been there for me through thick and thin. I know I have two of the best friends in the world. I have a good life. But I still feel horrid. I hate myself. I look in the mirror and wish I could stop seeing what I see. I used to be a really nice guy.

I&amp;#39;ve also got .5mg of lorazepam (Ativan) for anxiety attacks, and oxycodone (Percocet) for pain from a car accident a few months back... before the Percocet, I was on a butt ton of hydrocodone (Vicodin).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since they prescribed me speed, I&amp;#39;m awake and fairly talkative, so please let me regale you with tales of how absurd the prescription drug situation is in this country...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;#39;m pretty hip to the druggie swagger, so to speak, and this ain&amp;#39;t my first rodeo, so it&amp;#39;s really interesting to contrast the differing attitudes between legal and illicit drugs, especially how they differ between the medical and countercultural community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If need be, I can provide proof that this is my situation to a mod, but I&amp;#39;m not gonna post my picture next to my id and all of these prescription bottles and their dates on the free-range Internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL:DR; The medical establishment has heavily medicated me -- a quasi-hippie who enjoys him some drugs -- as part of my treatment, and I can&amp;#39;t sleep because of it, so let&amp;#39;s talk about health issues and drugs!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1309510309,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

He really loves kids, though, so I can see him wanting to procreate sometime in his life.\n\nThese are really shitty considerations and if I had heard myself say anything like this 5 years ago, I would have slapped myself and denounced myself as a calculating cynic.

(using the English Standard Version.) This is more of a personal project as I would like to learn more about one of the largest faiths of the world and try to understand how and what people believe. It may get gratuitously long, bear with me if you care. Or don’t, whatever floats your boat. If you have any ideas to share, please write a comment, this should make for some good discussion I hope.\n\nA little background before I begin. I was raised until I was around 10 as a Christian and then stopped going to church altogether. I went a couple times with my mother for Christmas, but beyond that I did not attend. There never really was a day that I became an atheist, I just am, and cannot pinpoint a time. Becoming an atheist was underwhelming and I can't say I ever wasn't. I am 16 years old currently, so don’t bash me too hard if I make a mistake, haha.\n\nOn to the Bible.\n\n**The Creation of the world.**\n\n*Summary*\n\n* So, starting off, god created the earth and everything on it. \n\n*Reflections*\n\n* Reading through the beginning of genesis I have noticed an incredible resemblance to word-of-mouth stories from long ago that I have learned about in my English classes. The repetition of lines such as 'it was good' and 'there was evening and there was morning' remind me strongly of tricks used to remember stories and keep people interested by repeating phrases. Also, people are made out of sand, not the weirdest thing in all of theism though.\n\n* I'll skip the Garden of Eden because most people know that one, and I'd be bored reading it again.\n\n**Cain and Abel**\n\n*Summary*\n\n* Cain was a farmer, Abel a shepherd. Abel brought God an offering of his finest sheep, while Cain brought an offering of fruit.\nGod 'had regard for Abel and his offering, but for Cain and his offering he had no regard.' God then questions why Cain is angry, and tells him essentially to do better. Cain kills his brother, and is sentenced to have the ground bear no fruit, and he will forever be a fugitive and wanderer of the earth. \n\n*Reflections*\n\n* God denies Cain even though the fruit offered has no stated defects. Is this a commentary on the hunting/agriculture change of early civilization? If so, this would show that God finds that it is holier work for a man to hunt (or raise) animals than it is to cultivate. If this were true, the human race as we know it and modern institutions of religion and society as a whole could never have come to pass as agriculture, now and then, is the foundation of modern society; it allows a relatively small portion of society to supply food for the masses and have society specialize. Without agriculture, the human race would be little more than the apes we are so closely related to this day. It does occur to me that sheep herding isn't strictly hunting, and is part of agriculture, however it still leads me to the idea that meat was superior to grown food. While it may be simple to read this story as merely ‘don’t kill your brother, duh’ the ideas behind it bring light to much deeper issues.\n\n**Adam’s descendants to Noah, and the flood**\n\n*Summary*\n\n* Adam has a son at age 130 named Seth, Adam lives to be 930.\n\n* Seth has a son at age 105 named Enosh, Seth lives to be 912.\n\n* Enosh has a son at age 90 named Kenan, Enosh lives to be 905.\n\n* (from here on abbreviated, this is long stuff. Father, age he has child, child’s name, father’s lifespan)\n\n* Kenan, 70, Mahalalel, 910.\n\n* Mahalalel, 65, Jared, 830.\n\n* Jared, 162, Enoch, 962.\n\n* Enoch, 65, Methuselah, 365.\n\n* Methuselah, 187, Lamech, 969.\n\n* Lamech, 182, Noah, 777.\n\n* Noah, 500, Shem Ham and Japheth. 950.\n\n* God declares that man may only live to be 120.\n\n* Noah’s story is well-known, so I will include merely the dimensions of the ark. The ark was to be 300 cubits long 50 cubits in breadth and 30 cubits in height.\n\n*Reflections*\n\n* Again the wording is repetitive, using phrases that are exactly the same save for the changing of names and ages. This would have made it incredibly easy to tell as a story through word of mouth because of only having to remember the names, as the years were inconsequential. Looking swiftly over the numbers also shows a trend of most of the ages being multiples of five, with 13/20 of the ages of birth/death being a multiple of five. With only 2 multiples of five per 10, 0 and 5, truly random ages should have been closer to one fifth of the total, with only 3 to 4 being a multiple of ten. The ages that are not a multiple of 5 all either end in 2 or 7, with the exception of Methuselah’s age of death at 969. This suggest to me that the ages were made up for the purpose of story-telling, on the spot and with little care to be accurate or random as they should be had they been real ages.\n\n* Of course this is all ignoring the fact that these humans were having kids at ages well over 100, with Noah being claimed to have fathered 3 sons at age 500. To live to nearly a millennia is truly impossible, and shows the fallacy in this book. While the religious would say that this is not supposed to be a factual representation, and should not be taken at its word, then why is everything else in the bible not subject to this same scrutiny?\n\n* With the flood based around the year 2348B.C.E. by the Ussher Chronology, published in 1650, the Young Earth Creationists idea of the age of the Earth can be calculated. The flood occurred when Noah was 600 at the time of the flood, so adding the ages of birth gives 1656 years before the flood, and then 4348 after, or around 6004 years old. While I’m sure there are other ways to guesstimate the age of the Earth according to bible scripture, using this technique requires the belief that these men lived almost entire millennia, and were not sterile well in to their 100’s. These are, again, simply not possible assumptions.\n\n* While it is true that before the time of Noah, human life-span was effectively limitless and only after was a 120 year limit put in to place, the purely *physical* aspects of these life-spans are impossible. Likewise, since then people have lived over 120 years. While it could be claimed this was merely an estimate, advances in medicine will continue to push the limit and before the century is out I would expect recorded life-spans of over 150.\n\t\n* Noah’s ark was measured in cubits, which are an antiquated system of measurement based on the forearm length. A close approximation of the length of a cubit is 50cm or about 1.5 feet. Looking to other stories from the time such as those of the king Gilgamesh could place a cubit at incredible lengths, as Gilgamesh was claimed to be many men tall, and the cubit was generally based around the king’s forearm. (Note also that the Epic of Gilgamesh references the flood around 2500B.C.E. as well, and that Gilgamesh reigned for 126 years [of course all based on the best translation possible currently]).\n\n* The general measurement of 50cm would make the ark 150 meters long, 25 meters in breadth, and 15 meters high. Assuming the ark was only about 20% filled by volume with wood (roof, 3 decks, hull, etc.) this would make the ark around 11250 cubic meters in volume of wood needed, or many hundreds of trees, depending on the size. Again, impossible to be taken literally, and the measurements and dates are closely linked with those in the Epic of Gilgamesh, suggesting that it was merely a tale passed on through word of mouth. Maybe there was a flood, it would make sense with the consistency, but somehow an ark of this size cannot be a historical event.\n\ntl;dr: Nope, much too long to summarize, read if you care.\n\nI think I’m done for now, I may continue this at a later date but it’s late and this could go on for hundreds of pages… so for now I’m going to stop.\n\nPlease comment on what you think of my reading so far, this took about 2 hours to make, and all research about historical and religious events and data come from memory or a cursory google search so some things may be wrong. Please feel free to add your own thoughts about these sections of the bible.

We talked about moving away somewhere, marriage, all that cute stuff and it honestly is something I look forward to when the time comes. \n\nBut then I just had another thought about my parents... they do not know i am an atheist, my mom just thinks I am a Catholic boy who tries to be rebellious about certain matters (like i'm cool with gay marriage, she isn't, etc). \n\nI've always struggled with religion, when I was little I always found prayer to be impossible because I never knew the difference between praying and thinking to yourself, I figured there had to be some extra technique nobody was telling me. Then around 7th grade I made friends with kids who were not religious and that made me realize that there were other options other than religion. I struggled with Catholicism all of high school, becoming more and more apathetic about it until my freshman year of college when i was talking to a friend and he pointed out that i did not seem to even believe in religion. i thought about it, did some reading, and have been an atheist ever since. i've felt really free now.\n\nbut anyway about my parents... if i moved in with a partner before marriage that would be a HUGE no-no in the Catholic faith (i guess because that would imply that i'm having sex or doing a married person thing?), if I didn't get married in a Catholic church that would also be a huge problem, as well as not baptizing children, not sending them to religious ed classes, etc.\n\nMy dad isn't crazy about it but my mom is absolutely irrational when it comes to matters of religion. There is no discussion with her. If I do any of those things I listed, I will kill her. Honestly she will be crushed so profoundly that I can't even fathom it. She truly believes her religion and for her own flesh and blood to do something so blatantly against it would ruin her. It would also wreck the relationship i have with my parents, who have been the best parents anyone could ask for.\n\nits just that im getting to a point where i can't hide my religious feelings like i've been doing for my childhood. now i just go to church every sunday and daydream and think about what im going to have for breakfast when i get home, but if i move out and try and start a new life, or a family, or whatever, i'll have to make some big decisions.\n\nso redditors with religious parents, what happened when you moved out? did you say \"fuck it\" and just do what you want and kind of lose your parents in the process? i still have a while to think about this but it doesnt hurt to be prepared. sorry for the long ass post.","domain":"self.atheism","num_comments":8,"likes":null,"clicked":false,"thumbnail":"default","saved":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","ups":10,"approved_by":null,"score":8,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey &lt;a href=\"/r/atheism\"&gt;/r/atheism&lt;/a&gt;, I normally don&amp;#39;t go on this subreddit but I really need to ask for some advice from redditors that have grown up with religious parents.

On Saturday, a girl that I've been hanging out with for a while as a friend will be coming over, and I'm starting to think she is going to want to have sex with me. I'm really tempted here, because this never happens to me. I'm 29 and I've only had sex with one girl before--the one who I'm in a relationship with right now. So there's the novelty factor and the fact that I am almost certainly not getting any until September.\n\nWhat are my obligations here?
