I live in the city with my parent. I'm still at high school and I'm 17 years old. If I can go through another year I don't care whether its A or D. I'm a smoker and I'm going to pub with my friends when I have enough money (It is legal to drink at age 18 in my country, so no one really cares). I recently met one girl and I find her kinda cute but I don't have enough confidence to ask her out or something (I don't even know why I am telling you this). I live with my mother and my stepdad (since age of 3). My grandpa is 68 and he has some liver issues along with some problem with legs and back, he also has water in his belly. He is in the hospital right now (I'd say it is somehow important for this dream). Ok, here is the dream:\nIt was getting dark and I had some kind of problem with demons or so, I don't know exactly why, but what I know is, that if even one demon saw the whole pack was coming after me - not right away, but they would know where I am and begin to go after me (it was kinda like Frodo when he put the ring on his finger and Sauron knew where he is. I was waiting in the car supposed to meet someone. When he finally arrived we talk for like 5 minutes in the car, we talk about the demons and how to get rid of them. Then, out of nowhere one demon grabbed him through a window and he ate him (or maybe just killed him, I can't really remember) and I knew he saw me, so I was trying to hide in the car. In the dream it felt like 20mins or so, when the demon would circle around the car, looking inside as I was hiding in there. I don't know what happened next, but I was out of the car - no sings of demons or dead body of that man anywhere, only my familky was there (my stepdad, mother, 12y/o brother and 6y/o brother). The car I was hiding in was a black bmw (I guess it isn't important) parked alongside the road. I can remember, that on the right side of the rode was a path which led to some forrest and on the left side there was just some fields. Also, near the car there was an electric pole (is this the right word? http://www.pise.cz/blog/img/fyzmatik/160433.jpg). The Sun was about to go down and I remember talking with my stepdad but I don't know about what. Anyway we decided to run into the forrest to get into safety house or so before more demons show up.\n&lt;Complete darkness at this moment&gt;\nThe next thing I remember is, that we are at our apartment and my mom and stepdad is packing some of the most important stuff. As far as I can remember I packed my keys, cigarettes, ligher, wallet and cellphone - I also carried a hamster in my hand (don't know exactly why - in real life we don't even have any pets. I had a hamster when I was about 5y/o but no pet ever since). My family was panicking about something, I don't knew exactly why but I felt it has something to do with those demons in my 'previous' dream. When we finally leaved our apartment we decided to head to our uncles place. I put the hamster on the ground and he knew exactly where we were going (he kinda led the way) but at 3/4 of the way I picked him up and then we continued in our path to get to uncles place. He did bite me 3 times until we finally get there.--One thing you have to know about my uncles place - it is like a garden, where we are going to drink and eat barbecue / steaks in the summer, etc. He also has a forrest like 3 meters away from his 'garden' - in this dream we were heading into this forrest in order to save ourselfs(?). There is also a rocky road for cars (like 15m) to get there--. As we were on this rocky road I noticed like twenty people standing there minding their own business and so we didn't care either. There was also a motorcycle helmet lying on the ground, covered with blood. We were almost at the 'entrance' to that forrest and my stepdad said this: \"We have to go through -Dark Forrest-\". (Yes, he really said Dark Forrest). I can remember, that I said something like \"whatever I ain't even scared\", but on the inside I was scared shitless.

I always found him attractive but never acted on it until his friend--also a good friend of mine--let me know he'd be interested in hooking up with me (which is all I was interested in as well). So I took advantage and we hung out in a group and later that night we ended up sleeping together. It all began as a late night hook up but as it went on we began talking more and more and hooking up every 2-3 days. I'm confused because I'm developing feelings for him because we are so insanely compatible and we both act like we adore each other however there are a few problems. \n1)He has a girlfriend of two years 2)I'm 18...he's 25\n\nBackground story on the girlfriend: Everyone who has ever met this girl cannot refrain from utilizing phrases all along the lines of \"she's a crazy bitch\". She literally hit him in the face for losing her at a concert weeks after he had jaw surgery and proceeded to tell him his (sick) mother would be disappointed in him. He keeps telling her he doesn't want to be with her and she simply shrugs it off and says \"we can work it out!\". He claims he's scared of her so he's breaking it off slowly but it's been two months. He makes it evident he's seeing someone else and she convinced herself she gave him a hickey that I did even knowing they hadn't hooked up. She even searched his car and told him she found \"blonde hair\" in his back seat (mine) and then let it go immediately.\n\nmy questions are: \n1) What do I do in this situation? Do you think he really cares about me and wants to be with me eventually?\n2) Is that age difference a big deal? It's 6 years and to him it seems weird he always says he wishes I were 20 so we could date.\n\nHe's always calling me beautiful and not in that \"I want to take your pants off way\", more like the \"I could lay here all night holding you\" way. I am extremely good at indicating sincerity and he feels so genuine when he reaches to hold my hand or tells me he could literally lay next to me al night and be happy. We talk on the phone, we text almost every day, it feels like we're dating but I can't help but get sad when I realize he's not really mine.","domain":"self.dating_advice","num_comments":3,"likes":null,"clicked":false,"thumbnail":"self","saved":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s4kl","ups":3,"approved_by":null,"score":2,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been working with this guy for two years, he&amp;#39;s a manager where I work.

It all began as a late night hook up but as it went on we began talking more and more and hooking up every 2-3 days. I&amp;#39;m confused because I&amp;#39;m developing feelings for him because we are so insanely compatible and we both act like we adore each other however there are a few problems. \n1)He has a girlfriend of two years 2)I&amp;#39;m 18...he&amp;#39;s 25&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Background story on the girlfriend: Everyone who has ever met this girl cannot refrain from utilizing phrases all along the lines of &amp;quot;she&amp;#39;s a crazy bitch&amp;quot;. She literally hit him in the face for losing her at a concert weeks after he had jaw surgery and proceeded to tell him his (sick) mother would be disappointed in him. He keeps telling her he doesn&amp;#39;t want to be with her and she simply shrugs it off and says &amp;quot;we can work it out!&amp;quot;. He claims he&amp;#39;s scared of her so he&amp;#39;s breaking it off slowly but it&amp;#39;s been two months. He makes it evident he&amp;#39;s seeing someone else and she convinced herself she gave him a hickey that I did even knowing they hadn&amp;#39;t hooked up. She even searched his car and told him she found &amp;quot;blonde hair&amp;quot; in his back seat (mine) and then let it go immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;my questions are: \n1) What do I do in this situation? Do you think he really cares about me and wants to be with me eventually?\n2) Is that age difference a big deal? It&amp;#39;s 6 years and to him it seems weird he always says he wishes I were 20 so we could date.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s always calling me beautiful and not in that &amp;quot;I want to take your pants off way&amp;quot;, more like the &amp;quot;I could lay here all night holding you&amp;quot; way. I am extremely good at indicating sincerity and he feels so genuine when he reaches to hold my hand or tells me he could literally lay next to me al night and be happy. We talk on the phone, we text almost every day, it feels like we&amp;#39;re dating but I can&amp;#39;t help but get sad when I realize he&amp;#39;s not really mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1338582328,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

We have always been cool with each other, but we were never like good friends or anything. This past weekend, I convinced my cousin and his girlfriend to come camping with me and some of my friends. This girl that I'm interested in came with them also. Through out the night, I feel like we really bonded. We went on a late night hike together, and we did pretty much everything together. When everyone started going to their tents, me and this girl went to chill in some other friends tents for a little bit and we ended up sleeping right next to each other, using each other for body heat (I didn't actually hold her because we ended up falling asleep in that tent with a few other people.) I feel like there was some IOI going on between us. She is throwing a party this weekend up in the mountains, which means camping again. She really wants me to go, and if everything works out I will totally be there.\n\n\nWell my real question for you all is how can I maybe get something going this weekend? As you can tell, I'm not exactly a player haha. I'm not even necessarily looking to have sex with her, but it would be freakin awesome since it's been so long since the last time I had sex. I need help with things such as how to make a move and let her see that I am interested early on in the night, any tips on having sex after 2 years like how to not completely suck at it, maybe some foreplay tips, or pretty much any tips you could throw my way would be awesome.\n\nThank you ahead of time.

When everyone started going to their tents, me and this girl went to chill in some other friends tents for a little bit and we ended up sleeping right next to each other, using each other for body heat (I didn&amp;#39;t actually hold her because we ended up falling asleep in that tent with a few other people.) I feel like there was some IOI going on between us. She is throwing a party this weekend up in the mountains, which means camping again. She really wants me to go, and if everything works out I will totally be there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well my real question for you all is how can I maybe get something going this weekend? As you can tell, I&amp;#39;m not exactly a player haha. I&amp;#39;m not even necessarily looking to have sex with her, but it would be freakin awesome since it&amp;#39;s been so long since the last time I had sex. I need help with things such as how to make a move and let her see that I am interested early on in the night, any tips on having sex after 2 years like how to not completely suck at it, maybe some foreplay tips, or pretty much any tips you could throw my way would be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you ahead of time. If I don&amp;#39;t reply to your comments right away its because I am at work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1338577519,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

We've been dating for almost 17 months. This is probably going to be a lengthy post, I apologize. Throwaway because he's a redditor. Also I'm well aware that a lot of my problems stem from my own wrongdoings and how young and naive I am, just be aware of that.\n\nI've had these problems with my boyfriend for a long time and I guess I just denied that it would turn into a bigger issue. I guess I'll start at the beginning.\n\nWe were set up as blind dates after I broke off a relationship I had with a guy I dated in high school to the very beginning of college for ~2 years. I was deciding between a few different guys to pursue at the time, and I don't want to say I settled, but I sort of \"settled\" for this guy, I'll call him A. He was very sweet, my ideal man in terms of appearance, and was very interested in me. We saw each other a few times after the initial set up, and we didn't see each other for about a month, but we texted frequently and he became more interested in me, and eventually he decided to make it FBO (facebook official). Things were pretty fun initially, we went out together a lot, but the first weekend we were officially together he drank too much (a reoccurring theme) and became very upset with me because I wouldn't have sex with him. I explained to him that we had just started dating, I didn't want to rush into stuff, he was seemingly okay with it. I ended up having sex with him a few weeks later and he was happy. He later disclosed to me that during the initial courting part of our relationship he was only interested in sex, wasn't interested at all in pursuing a relationship, but I was interested and charming and someone he wanted to be with, so he ended up making it official.\n\nTo make a 17 month story short, A kept drinking a lot and it's just something I chalked up to his personality. He never physically hit me, but sometimes when we fought after he drank a lot he would say the most cruel things to me, calling me a c word, telling me to date other guys or go back to a guy I had been talking to before I even knew him. Recently I got around to asking him why he did these things and hurt my feelings so bad, and he said he wants to \"win\". Win? I'm pretty sure relationships require teamwork and there is no \"winner\".... It makes me sick just thinking about it.\n\nAfter our last big fight, he said something along the lines of \"I want to break up with you just to see you suffer.\" A has said things along the line of this for a while but I blew it off as not serious. He even goes so far as to demand that I break up with him and egg me on, and when I actually did it once, he blamed all of it on me and said \"I guess you don't want me anymore.\" I was horribly upset for a week and came crawling back, giving him power just like he wanted...\n\nSomething awful I did was pressuring him into taking the relationship further. I pressured him from almost the beginning to give me a promise ring, because it's something that was so important to me at the time. He eventually did give it to me and I was incredibly happy, but it felt almost hollow and empty. Like I finally got what I wanted, but did I really want it anymore?\n\nI'm sure by this point a lot of people are thinking I'm an idiot for not breaking up with him a long, long time ago, but there's so much good in the relationship. A understands my sense of humor, comes from a similar family and religious background as me, gets along with my family and friends great, and is a very reliable, genuine, responsible, smart guy. We have so much fun together, I love spending time with him, and he's someone I would love to share a future with. He always knows how to make me laugh.\n\nBut when I try bringing up anything with A, he becomes INCREDIBLY defensive, angry, hurt, and upset, and he will not calm down for anything. He says things to hurt my feelings, calls me worthless, says \"f*** you, go date someone else\", calls me a b****, and will try to alienate me from his life by saying things like \"I don't want to see you or talk to you or even think about you for the next 2 weeks. Stay away from me.\" It really really hurts my feelings that someone that says he wants to spend the rest of his life with me and loves me with all his heart will so easily be incredibly cruel to me to \"win\" the argument. I grew up with my mother being the same way, so in these situations I immediately start crying and close off, so it's just as much my fault that these arguments are never productive.\n\nLike clockwork, after every fight or argument or disagreement where I just \"let him win\", A apologizes, says he's sorry, and goes back to being the perfect loving, understanding boyfriend that comforts me when I need him and can't imagine his life without me. Sometimes he even goes so far as to bawl his eyes out, apologizing and saying he's worthless and that I should break up with him and that I deserve better.

Also I&amp;#39;m well aware that a lot of my problems stem from my own wrongdoings and how young and naive I am, just be aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had these problems with my boyfriend for a long time and I guess I just denied that it would turn into a bigger issue. I guess I&amp;#39;ll start at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were set up as blind dates after I broke off a relationship I had with a guy I dated in high school to the very beginning of college for ~2 years. I was deciding between a few different guys to pursue at the time, and I don&amp;#39;t want to say I settled, but I sort of &amp;quot;settled&amp;quot; for this guy, I&amp;#39;ll call him A. He was very sweet, my ideal man in terms of appearance, and was very interested in me. We saw each other a few times after the initial set up, and we didn&amp;#39;t see each other for about a month, but we texted frequently and he became more interested in me, and eventually he decided to make it FBO (facebook official). Things were pretty fun initially, we went out together a lot, but the first weekend we were officially together he drank too much (a reoccurring theme) and became very upset with me because I wouldn&amp;#39;t have sex with him. I explained to him that we had just started dating, I didn&amp;#39;t want to rush into stuff, he was seemingly okay with it. I ended up having sex with him a few weeks later and he was happy. He later disclosed to me that during the initial courting part of our relationship he was only interested in sex, wasn&amp;#39;t interested at all in pursuing a relationship, but I was interested and charming and someone he wanted to be with, so he ended up making it official.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make a 17 month story short, A kept drinking a lot and it&amp;#39;s just something I chalked up to his personality. He never physically hit me, but sometimes when we fought after he drank a lot he would say the most cruel things to me, calling me a c word, telling me to date other guys or go back to a guy I had been talking to before I even knew him. Recently I got around to asking him why he did these things and hurt my feelings so bad, and he said he wants to &amp;quot;win&amp;quot;. Win? I&amp;#39;m pretty sure relationships require teamwork and there is no &amp;quot;winner&amp;quot;.... It makes me sick just thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After our last big fight, he said something along the lines of &amp;quot;I want to break up with you just to see you suffer.&amp;quot; A has said things along the line of this for a while but I blew it off as not serious. He even goes so far as to demand that I break up with him and egg me on, and when I actually did it once, he blamed all of it on me and said &amp;quot;I guess you don&amp;#39;t want me anymore.&amp;quot; I was horribly upset for a week and came crawling back, giving him power just like he wanted...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something awful I did was pressuring him into taking the relationship further. I pressured him from almost the beginning to give me a promise ring, because it&amp;#39;s something that was so important to me at the time. He eventually did give it to me and I was incredibly happy, but it felt almost hollow and empty. Like I finally got what I wanted, but did I really want it anymore?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure by this point a lot of people are thinking I&amp;#39;m an idiot for not breaking up with him a long, long time ago, but there&amp;#39;s so much good in the relationship. A understands my sense of humor, comes from a similar family and religious background as me, gets along with my family and friends great, and is a very reliable, genuine, responsible, smart guy. We have so much fun together, I love spending time with him, and he&amp;#39;s someone I would love to share a future with. He always knows how to make me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when I try bringing up anything with A, he becomes INCREDIBLY defensive, angry, hurt, and upset, and he will not calm down for anything. He says things to hurt my feelings, calls me worthless, says &amp;quot;f*** you, go date someone else&amp;quot;, calls me a b****, and will try to alienate me from his life by saying things like &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want to see you or talk to you or even think about you for the next 2 weeks. Stay away from me.&amp;quot; It really really hurts my feelings that someone that says he wants to spend the rest of his life with me and loves me with all his heart will so easily be incredibly cruel to me to &amp;quot;win&amp;quot; the argument. I grew up with my mother being the same way, so in these situations I immediately start crying and close off, so it&amp;#39;s just as much my fault that these arguments are never productive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like clockwork, after every fight or argument or disagreement where I just &amp;quot;let him win&amp;quot;, A apologizes, says he&amp;#39;s sorry, and goes back to being the perfect loving, understanding boyfriend that comforts me when I need him and can&amp;#39;t imagine his life without me. Sometimes he even goes so far as to bawl his eyes out, apologizing and saying he&amp;#39;s worthless and that I should break up with him and that I deserve better. Every time I would say &amp;quot;No, I love YOU, YOU are the man I love.&amp;quot; Am I stupid?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr Can I salvage a relationship I&amp;#39;ve invested so much in with a sometimes immature, disrespectful, mean boyfriend?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anybody been in a similar situation and can help me?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1338575944,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}
