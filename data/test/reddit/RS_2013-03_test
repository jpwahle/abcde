After my father passed away, she tried starting her own business.  She made a fuck-ton of profit, but spent every penny she made on vacations, concerts, and parties.  In about a year, around tax time, she declared bankruptcy.  A few years later, she started another business, same results.  Then for the next few years, she worked 3 different jobs just to keep food on the table for my sisters and I.  Just 2 years ago she took over my grandfather's (her father's) business that he owned for many years.  Around tax time, she was in serious trouble.  This new business was different from the others because it dealt directly with the state, so now she owed the state money.  When she took the business over, there was $30k in the business account.  The account was overdrawn by the time she was audited.  She needed $2000 to pay off all of her debts and stay out of jail.  I gave it to her and she promised to pay it back.  I never expected it back, and I never got it back.  I was 20 when I payed her, living with my GF and our 2 kids.  Neither of us made a lot of money and $2000 was all I had, I was saving up to fix my porch and garage which was collapsing badly.  Now it's a year later, I'm 21 and I have about $4000 saved up.  I was planning on repairing the porch and getting a more fuel efficient car with the money, due to my truck getting about 8mpg.  My mom called me today and said she needs money to make a payment tonight if she wants to stay out of jail.  The minimum payment due is $3000.  She has multiple payments that need to be made.  My sisters still live with my mom and I worry about my 7year old sister because she is partially adopted.  She is technically owned by the state.  So if my mom goes to jail, I lose my sister, and I really don't want that.  My other sister is 18 and has a place to go.  My mom is suicidal and she threatens to kill her self from time to time.  I'm afraid the idea of her going to jail will push her to do it.  So basically, If I don't pay my mom, she's going to die, and I'll never see my sister again.  But if I keep paying her, she will never change her ways.  She can't get a loan, she is making payments on quite a few loans and credit cards right now.  She rents a small house and has a $5000 lien on a $500 car.  She stole money from her own father and has no one left but me.  She has nothing. I have a few hours left to send her the first payment.   I paid off over half of my house so I can sell it if necessary.  But I'll never get that money back.  I've been working overtime 2 out of 4 weeks for the past 6 months to save up this money, I'm exhausted, and I'll have nothing to show for it if I keep paying my mom.  What would you do in this situation? \n\nSorry if I sound whiny, I know there are kids in Africa with nothing and homeless people that barely survive every day.  I know I have it good.  I have it great.  My porch is caving into my basement and the roof is collapsing with it, so it's kind of a messy situation and that's why it's an important issue.  I'm not trying to put the porch issue above my mom, I'm just worried about my life in the future if this money problem keeps happening.\n\nedit: She just called me.  She has $23,000 due to the state in 30 days.  She said she killing herself tonight and I need to go get my sister.  Fuck!...\n\n\nedit again:  I went over to her house to calm her down and protect her from herself.  Turns out my mom is also a hoarder.  I talked to her and let her know I wasn't going to give her any money, but I'll help her make some.  We're going to try and sell everything in the house, most of it isn't valuable but every penny will help.  Thanks for the advice!  I'm glad I didn't give in and give her the money.  It wouldn't help anyway.  Actually even if we sell everything she owns, it won't be enough.  She's going to jail at some point, but I think everything will be alright in the end.\n\n\nFinal edit:  It's all under control now.  I called the police because of her suicide threats and they hauled her to the hospital.  She is self conscious of her problems and goes to start seeing a therapist this week.  She spent all day listing stuff on eBay.  She knows she will never own or run a business again, all she wants is a paycheck at the end of the workday.  She needs to work on her spending addiction but I'm going to help her now.  I can finally sit and have a conversation with her without being shown what she got on sale.  I'm proud of her and she's handling everything well.  This never would have happened if I gave her the money.  Thanks for the help!  Her debt to the state is paid thanks to my grandfather.  He took out a second mortgage on his house and my mom feels horrible knowing that he did that.  But she set up a bank account and everything she makes from selling will go directly back to my grandfather.","link_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjdm","permalink":"/r/Advice/comments/19honw/should_i_keep_paying_my_mom_to_keep_her_out_of/","over_18":false,"author":"[deleted]","num_comments":5,"gilded":0,"media_embed":{},"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/19honw/should_i_keep_paying_my_mom_to_keep_her_out_of/","created_utc":1362178457,"banned_by":null,"edited":1362361043,"retrieved_on":1413022487,"author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.Advice","user_reports":[],"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":null,"report_reasons":null,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long story, I&amp;#39;ll try keep it short.

He is in the Coast Guard and I am finishing up grad school in another state. We are head over heels in love and decided that we will get married around or slightly before the time I graduate, maybe mid-July. The distance is killing us and we cannot wait to finally be able to start our lives together.  \n\n   I have no idea where to start. We were thinking about eloping for money-saving purposes but I know a part of me will be upset if we don't have a ceremony.We aren't in the spot to pay for a wedding right now and don't feel comfortable asking for parent contributions. Him and I could probably scrounge up $3000/$4000 to have *something* but everything I have looked into is ridiculously expensive. We were looking at airbnb.com to rent a nice house somewhere for a few days and doing a small ceremony there, but even that seems like it will end up being pricey. \n\n   I would say we just do a courthouse wedding and do a small get together at a rental house afterwards but I really want my dad to walk me down the aisle, want to do the father-daughter dance, etc. We would wait to get married until we could afford a ceremony but we need to do it around the time of graduation for moving purposes. \n\n   Is $4000 too little to even bother trying to do a ceremony? What was your budget, if it was similar to mine, what did you do? My friend and I started discussing wedding planning last night and my head almost exploded. I always thought bride-to-be's were exaggerating about the stress of planning a wedding, but holy crap it's overwhelming. \n\nAny ideas would be super helpful.

The distance is killing us and we cannot wait to finally be able to start our lives together.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea where to start. We were thinking about eloping for money-saving purposes but I know a part of me will be upset if we don&amp;#39;t have a ceremony.We aren&amp;#39;t in the spot to pay for a wedding right now and don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable asking for parent contributions. Him and I could probably scrounge up $3000/$4000 to have &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; but everything I have looked into is ridiculously expensive. We were looking at airbnb.com to rent a nice house somewhere for a few days and doing a small ceremony there, but even that seems like it will end up being pricey. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would say we just do a courthouse wedding and do a small get together at a rental house afterwards but I really want my dad to walk me down the aisle, want to do the father-daughter dance, etc. We would wait to get married until we could afford a ceremony but we need to do it around the time of graduation for moving purposes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is $4000 too little to even bother trying to do a ceremony? What was your budget, if it was similar to mine, what did you do? My friend and I started discussing wedding planning last night and my head almost exploded.

Some days I&amp;#39;m able to think rational thoughts. But I read somewhere that a disproportionate amount of pedophiles are left handed and that freaked me out because I&amp;#39;m left handed.

I&amp;#39;m normally a person with a lot of conscience and I really try to do the right thing all the time, so why don&amp;#39;t I feel disgust when I hear about child sex abuse?

But I just feel like an empty pit of nothing when it comes to that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, sometimes I test myself by thinking about whether I&amp;#39;m sexually attracted to kids, and occasionally I&amp;#39;ll imagine something sexual involving a child and I actually have gotten KIND of aroused a few times.

I don&amp;#39;t know if our minds our meant to respond to anyhting sexual, but I think about sex with adults and it doesn&amp;#39;t do as much as it used to with me anymore.

Courtesy of /u/jAmazing and /u/PeanutButterJellyYou **\n\nWhen you're looking for a bike you're likely to find bikes with 26 inch or 29 inch wheels (there is also a 650b size which is like 27.5 inches that sits between, but those are relatively less popular). There are advantages to both sizes: \n\nBikes built around a 29inch wheel set are more forgiving, often easier to climb with and typically feel more stable, making them easy (not necessarily better) learning bikes. They're nice and fast on relatively open terrain, so if (1) your local trails aren't overly tight and/or (2) you're a taller or heavier rider a 29er may be for you. As a side note - you can learn to ride a 29er in tight conditions as well, it just won't feel as snappy.\n\nA 26 inch is the other end of the spectrum. This more \"traditional\" wheel size has been tested for years and years and years. They can be zippy bikes that take nimble turns and accelerate quickly. They are much much better suited than their big-wheeled brethren to handle tight, twisty single track. Another note here - I was told time and time again that a 26 inch hard tail mountain bike is less forgiving than most bikes. By learning on one you develop skills early on that will make you a stronger rider in the end.\n\nA 29er climbs better, rolls faster, and handles obstacles with more ease...among other things. When you ride a 26, all of those things are more difficult. So, you'll work harder on climbs, roll slower (albeit a 26 can be just as fast...just not as mathematically efficient), and when you encounter obstacles you'll need to be more technically savvy. You can't \"cheat\" as much on a 26; you need to really focus on the trail. I'd say that last point is the kicker. With less clearance underneath you, you'll need to be able to handle rock juts, tall roots, and whatever else the devil has in-store for your bottom bracket and crank arm ends. \n\nIt's kind of like being able to walk before you run. Your bunny hopping skills and maneuverability amongst obstacles will be honed on a 26 because if you hit said obstacles wrong you'll either fall or come to a stop or veer off course into worse obstacles. Those same obstacles are typically more manageable on a 29er simply due to the wheel size and momentum those wheels carry. \n\nMy first bike was a 26in Kona hardtail and I certainly bashed my pedals on rocks, slammed my big chainwheel on protrusions, and scraped my crank arms along obstacles I hadn't approached/managed correctly. Flash-forward to now and I've got a 29er that can breeze over those same obstacles...sometimes a slight raise of the front end is necessary but I can pretty much roll or bump over most stuff. \n\nThat's a pretty nitty gritty explanation but basically you work harder on a 26 than a 29 to gain the same amount of distance on a given trail. That \"hard work\" translates into adapting to situations as they fly at you on the trail i.e. gaining some skill/balance/know how. When you work harder you're better able to appreciate and understand why different(better) technology works and why you may need it.\n\n**What to keep in mind when trying out bikes. Courtesy of /u/PeanutButterJellyYou /u/jAmazing /u/DaFrog418 and /u/Mt_Hood **\n\nDon't go in with an amount to spend in mind, go into it with the mindset that you want to get the right bike...or nearly the right back ...the first time. Once you find a bike you like and you understand (to a degree) it's mechanical set-up you can start deducting certain features to get to a price-point you like. If you start out unwilling to surpass a certain price range you won't get the exposure you need to understand what's out there. A question that may get some eye-rolls from salespeople is \"why is this bike costlier/better than this bike?\" Disregard the eye-roll, it's their job to explain it to you in language you can understand. If you can test ride something you like, do it.\n\nHave an idea of where you're going to ride it. Maybe find forums about local trails. Is it hilly, technical, rooty, rocky? I live in the Mid-West, Missouri to be exact and a 29er hardtail handles everything pretty well. I don't need a lot of suspension and there aren't a lot of super technical downhills but occasionally I find myself in a rocky/rooty sections where I appreciate the front suspension. If you know where you're going to ride than you'll be able to better pin-point a bike with all the features you need and none of the bells and whistles you don't.\n\nYou know you'll need a helmet, pump, riding type clothes, repair tools for tires/wheels/minor adjustments (seat height, grip position, saddle position), and some safety glasses. The rest of the stuff you'll realize you want/need once you get more into the sport. Oh, and once you feel comfortable (sooner than later though) get clipless pedals and some cycling shoes. In my opinion, you should buy the shoes and pedals when you buy the bike. If you must ride platforms because you're hesitant to attach yourself to the bike get through that phase quick because (unless it's down hill) you will perform better and be safer riding clipped in.\n\nSo 1) try helmets, 2) get one that fits 3) get glasses 4) get gloves 5) if spending less than $2k, go with a hardtail 6) go to a few bike shops and try bikes as discussed above 7) put helmet on 8) make sure you have water, a spare tube (or extra Stan's ) and a smile 9) check that helmet is on 10) ride\n\nIf you've got back issues maybe you should opt for a smaller frame so you don't get stretched. I'm 5'11ish and ride a 19in frame which is often called a large. It's a bit big but I like to be stretched out when I'm doing XC riding and I've got kinda long arms. Sometimes my lower back aches and I think it's due to being stretched out...then again you can always mess with stem length, crank length, saddle position, bar width, and a host of other things to dial in a fit. Good luck and have fun. When you fall, get back up.\n\nAlso, if you plan on keeping your first bike for a while, decide carefully. If you know you'll be selling it in a year or so to upgrade, go ahead and do a 26 and you'll be more well rounded as a rider. If you want to keep your bike for a while, don't be hasty deciding between the two sizes as they will produce a vastly different feeling.\n","link_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo3d","permalink":"/r/MTB/comments/19hmcn/new_to_mountain_biking/","subreddit":"MTB","secure_media_embed":{},"score":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"secure_media":null,"downs":0,"ups":7,"title":"New to mountain biking","id":"19hmcn","distinguished":null,"media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"report_reasons":null,"mod_reports":[],"is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I checked out the side bar looking for an overview of how to get into mountain biking and what equipment would be good for a beginner to purchase, etc. I was a bit surprised to see that there was nothing there as of yet.

Anyone going through this knows there's a tonne of tests and other generally irksome crap that one has to go through. My neurologist requested that I get bloodwork done to rule out diabetes or thyroid issues that may have something to do with my neuropathic pain. I got an EMG and my ulnar nerve's myelination is intact (my nerve impulses were \"gorgeous\", in fact, according to the technician) I haven't communicated to either my GP or neurologist about doing keto because *shrugs* it's none of their business what I eat. However, I am worried that the bloodwork will look suspicious somehow - will it make it seem like I have diabetes? Or should I go back to a SAD diet for a few days before the test? I am supposed to fast for 12 hours before the test in any event so I'm not sure it will have an affect at all!

My neurologist requested that I get bloodwork done to rule out diabetes or thyroid issues that may have something to do with my neuropathic pain.

I am very grateful.","banned_by":null,"created_utc":1362160978,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/19h2ss/need_help/","gilded":0,"num_comments":4,"media_embed":{},"over_18":false,"author":"quantumfoam435"}
{"selftext":"Last month, one of my highschool friends currently announced via Facebook that him and his girlfriend of 11 months are expecting.
