I haven't posted here before, but I've been wanting to. I've just been waiting for a time where I actually had peace so I could focus and do this. I apologize in advance for the length and disorderliness of this--it'll be the first time I've tried to collect *all* my thoughts about my mother into one place. I hope that this actually fits here.\n\nI'm 25, going to be 26 in November, just so you have a little bit of context for the following since events are a little spread out.\n \nMy mother used to work a lot when I was a kid. Like, so much I hardly saw her, and really only spent time with my dad and siblings [older brother, who is a whole fucking mess all his own, and my older sister]. She's a caregiver--she cares for elderly people in their homes. She's very well-loved by all those she takes care of, and has no trouble finding work in that area because of it. \n\nIt was around middle school that she had a bit more time to spend at home. I think because my dad had gotten a better job, so she didn't have to work as many hours. We started butting heads, of course. She didn't know who I was, and disliked everything I did. She wanted me to change my personality to suit something *she* would like. But this isn't really where the trouble started, either.\n\nNo, the trouble started in high school. I've always been overweight, and she and my brother were the only ones who ever made me feel bad about it. She'd always look at whatever I was eating with disdain, always making comments about how bad x food was for me, talking about how I'd be prettier if I was skinny, how she wished she didn't have to feed me anything because *food is poison.* Really, that's a legitimate quote. \"Food is poison.\" My mom is one of those people who's obsessed with eating healthy and exercising, and to a fault, obviously.\n\nI think I developed some sort of eating disorder. I don't know for sure, because I never saw anyone about it. But I started being *afraid* of eating if she was home. If she walked in the front door while I was making myself something as simple as a fucking *sandwich*, I would fly into a panic and try to find a place to hide what I was doing. If she was home the whole day, I would skip eating, period. I couldn't do it. Not while she kept making such hateful, stupid comments, that basically just let me know how much she hates that I'm fat. One time a friend of mine who lives *ten hours away* was so upset for me that she actually found a local pizza place and ordered me food herself, because of how miserable I seemed. It's been probably about eight years since then, and I've never forgotten that she did that for me.\n\nShaming me for my weight is one thing. The other is the fact that my brother was physically and emotionally abusing me when my parents weren't around, which in high school was pretty much the entire day, until about 8PM. I'd get home from school and lock myself in my room, hiding from him, scared. And when I finally worked up the courage to tell my mother what was happening, she didn't want to hear about it--\"He's young, he doesn't know what he's doing.\" \n\nI was 15. My brother was 30. \"Too young to understand\" is an excuse you use for a toddler, not a fully-grown man with his own child. \n\nMy father, hating confrontation, just stayed out of it. But he's also a shitheel in his own way. I don't think he's an N, though, so he doesn't exactly belong here.\n\nI have a PTSD diagnosis that revolves *explicitly* around my brother. I cannot be around him. Hearing his voice makes me so angry. I remember asking the social worker I've been speaking to while trying to find a therapist if PTSD can manifest as anger, because it's not the first thing I think of when I think PTSD. I mean, you usually think of fucking war veterans and flashbacks, not a reclusive 20-something wanting to scream and rip out her brother's eyes, right? I'm anxious and furious, and somewhere under that, I'm scared. He's bigger than me and he can hurt me and if we talk, we'll just argue and then he might hurt me and nobody will do anything. I have literal *nightmares* about him, dreams where he's doing awful things and I'm trying to warn people, to tell them, and nobody will listen to me or help me. I wake up crying and Boyfriend has to calm me down.\n\nAnd yet, my brother still comes to visit. He's still allowed in the house. My mother knows this, she was *present for said diagnosis and the explanation involving my brother,* and she still lets him come by.\n\nBut I don't know if the aforementioned things are enough to earn my mom a place here--so let me keep going.\n\nWhere she *really* shines is when receiving any sort of criticism of herself. I once gently tried to talk to her about how I was nervous about eating around her, while I was in college. She *lost it.* she started shrieking at me about how it was all my fault, she didn't do *anything, I'm* the one who's causing the problem, oh but if she's so *awful* then maybe she should just *leave and go somewhere where I'll never see her again.* And then she slammed my door and stomped away downstairs.\n\nAnother, recent instance, after I talked to a social worker who suggested family therapy with my mother: I suggest it while we're walking my dog together one night, saying \"I would like nothing more than to get along, and I think this could help us.\"\n\nNope. \"No, I don't need to *go* to any *therapy*, because I'm just the *worst*, I'm just the *worst*, aren't I?!\" And she stormed away into the house, leaving me on the lawn with my confused dog.\n\n\nThat's the gist of it, really--any sort of criticism is met with explosive, bitter anger and tantrums. \n\nAnother argument we had, I angrily brought up how when my brother was abusing me, she didn't listen. She said \"Well whatever he did to you must have been just *horrible* if you're so upset about!\" FUCKING--YEAH?? IT WAS AWFUL. HE BERATED ME AND HIT ME ON A DAILY BASIS. *YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT ME BUT YOU DEFENDED HIM INSTEAD.* And I'll never fucking forgive you. I'll carry it with me like sludge in my veins until I can escape.\n\nShe's also really paranoid. When my siblings were younger [back before I was born], my sister had a friend who lives two houses over. My mom *never* let her go visit her friend. One day the girl's dad came over to ask if my sister could stay over for her friend's birthday because she was having a slumber party, and he thought that maybe it would put my mother at ease to meet the girl's parents. My mom agreed to let my sister go, but after the guy left, she told my sister it was only this once, and only because she couldn't tell her no with the guy right there.\n\nShe was more lenient with me, but there was still so much of this paranoia that everyone I met was out to rape/murder/kidnap me. A couple of years ago, my boyfriend [who lives here with my family] and I were taking the Greyhound bus down to LA from San Francisco, so we could visit his parents. My mom wouldn't leave me alone about how I needed to be in *constant* contact with her, how I had to be careful. \"You never know, somebody might invite you over for coffee, and you'll think that sounds like a fine idea, and then they'll take you!\"\n\nRemember that I'm 25 years old? I was 23 at the time. And I didn't even drink coffee.\n\nRecently, as in within the last few weeks, Boyfriend I flew up to Oregon for a friend's wedding. We were going to spend a week up there, because my friend asked if we would so we could hang out. I was happy to oblige, and she was even so incredibly gracious as to cover our airfare and hotel costs because of how badly she wanted us to be there, and she didn't want me worrying about saving up when she already had the money on hand. Everything was booked and paid for back in January. But around April, my mom starts hemming and hawing, suddenly unsure if she's going to \"let\" us go. \n\nNo. No, no, no. I'm a fucking *adult.* There is no \"let.\" There's only \"Everything is paid for and the plane tickets are non-refundable, so we're going.\" I let her know exactly that. She didn't like it, but non-refundable is non-refundable. She demanded my friend's full name, address, a picture of her, her phone number, the hotel's name, address, and phone number. I gave her all the information just to shut her up, and I apologized to my friend for the interrogation. she was fine with it, as long as it meant I was coming to visit.\n\nBut mom wouldn't fucking leave me alone during the trip. She called and texted me *constantly.* It was fucking embarrassing, we'd have to stop what we were doing [video games, board games, etc.] so that I could deal with my mom and let know that no, I haven't been fucking murdered, I'm fine. I made the mistake of going to the movies one night without letting her know, and when we came back out I had three missed calls from her and a voicemail freaking out about whether or not I was okay. I just texted her I'd been in a movie, and she seemed calmed by that, but just--it's too goddamn much. \n\nShe keeps telling me about how much she wants me to gain my independence, but then she treats me like a fucking baby. And then she keeps telling me I'm the only reason she's still here in the US, and how bad she wants to move back to El Salvador--making me feel guilty about keeping her here.\n\nAnother fun aside, something from college. One time she asked if I was sure I don't want to have kids. I don't. She asked what I was going to do if Boyfriend wanted kids. I told her he'd have to deal, because he can't make me have any. We've already discussed it before anyways, he knows I don't want kids, he's fine with that. If I ever change my mind, we both agree that we could adopt, because the idea of pregnancy is *extremely* unappealing to me. But he's not holding his breath for kids.\n\nMom said, \"No, he'll just leave you and find someone else who will give him children.\" \n\nMind at that point, Boyfriend and I had been together for seven years. I just stood up, said \"There is a line, and you have crossed it,\" and went up to my room without another word. My sister [the only good person in my family] later came up to try and soothe me, and explain that mom was just joking, but it was such an ugly joke. At least my sister understood that I was upset and didn't try to say that what mom did was okay.\n\nWhat else...ah yeah, my dog, Oreo. Mom *adores* him. I mean, everyone does, he's a big sweetheart [[I'd better pay the pet tax](http://imgur.com/9o09D2L)]. But my mom is *insane* about him. I take care of him. He eats and he plays and he goes for his walks and he gets kisses and cuddles and toys and treats and vet visits when he needs them. Four nights out of the week, when Boyfriend isn't working closing shifts, instead of a regular walk, we take him to the nearby lagoon. There's a big, beautiful grassy area there, and we let him off-leash to play fetch until he can't fetch no mo'. His vet says he's very healthy and happy. If our bed and room weren't so small and our dog so huge, I'd let Oreo sleep in here with us. Our previous dog slept on my parents' bed [he was a Yorkie], we're very lax about dogs-on-the-furniture rules here. \n\nMy mom likes to scream at me and call me an animal abuser if Oreo doesn't go out to pee every hour, on the hour. She also insists I take him for a full walk *every* time he needs to pee. Which, yeah, it'd be fun for him, but that's a bit absurd. He gets two good walks a day, the rest of the time I take him near the lagoon [it's less than a minute's walk from my house] and let him do his business. But I'm not taking him for a half hour walk every time he needs to pee a little bit. Especially not if it's late at night. Boyfriend and I stay up late a lot, so Oreo is up late too and sometimes needs to go out as late as 2AM--*definitely* not time for walkies.\n\nBut because she's back to working like four days/nights out of the week, she thinks we just keep him shut up in the house all the time and ignore him and make him hold everything in. Which is absolutely untrue. But she doesn't believe we take care of him. I'll usually wake up around 7AM and feed him, sleep a little more, and take him out around 9-10AM. She came pounding on our door a couple of days ago at 8AM, screaming that \"THE DOG NEEDS TO GO OUTSIDE *RIGHT NOW*, YOU NEED TO GET UP! IF YOU DON'T TAKE HIM OUTSIDE THEN THIS IS ANIMAL ABUSE, YOU'RE ABUSING THIS ANIMAL, AND YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT!\" Oreo was whining, but he always does that when someone knocks on my door. It gets him all excited. He also whines and goes nuts around my mom because he fucking *loves* her [dogs really like her, strangely]. She mistakes his excitement for needing to pee, when 90% of the time it's not that at all. He just wants her attention, or wants to play.\n\nTurns out he just wanted to get into our room, because as soon as I opened the door he came in and curled up on the bed. Animal abuse. Right. \n\nShe's always talking about how she's going to take him to El Salvador, like she can just up and drag him across the border without a fight from me. Sometimes she's obviously joking, but it still makes me sick to think she feels like she can just take him away from me. Some people have kids. I have Oreo. She wouldn't threaten to take any of my sibling's kids away from them [even though my brother shouldn't be allowed anywhere near children], so I don't see how this is any better. He's mine. I'll fight her tooth and nail if she thinks she's taking my dog away from me. Oreo has helped me out with my depression so much that taking him away would be a crippling emotional blow to me. He's helped me live again. He gets me out of the house, even if it's just for a little bit. Seeing him happy makes me so happy that I feel my heart could explode; she can't fucking have him.\n\nAnd just--there's just, a million other, little things she does that drive me up the wall. Boyfriend hates living here with my family as much as I do--\"When I moved here, I didn't know it would be like *this.*\" But he loves me, so he's toughing it out because he doesn't want to leave me here with them.\n\nWe have a plan, newly-hatched. My friend from Oregon who just got married? We had a serious talk with them. They're planning on getting a house, and when they do, they said they're more than willing to rent us a room at what will be a very reasonable price, because OR is *way* cheaper than LA. So I've been applying for jobs so that I can help Boyfriend save up so we can get our shit and go. I've told no one in my family, and don't intend to until it's too late for them to do or say anything.\n\nAnd then, I'm changing my phone number and never speaking to my mother again, or at least for as long as suits me.\n\nThere are parts of my mom that I think are good. She has always made sure I have good clothes and shoes, that I have warm blankets for winter. If we're short on grocery money, she's always willing to help us out. Oreo recently had a recurring limp and my mom insisted that the vet x-ray his leg to make sure nothing was broken, and then paid for it herself. When she does these things, I feel like her heart is in the right place.\n\nBut then she opens her mouth, and it's like acid comes pouring out. She is a good provider, but emotionally, she fails as a mother, and I need to get away from her if I ever want to make a real recovery of any sort from the depression I've been struggling with for years. I've taken one step so far--the job applications--and I hope that soon that step will turn into a second, a third--and then I'll be running, far and free from this poison.\n\nGod, this got long. I've been writing for over and hour now, I think. I don't know how many of you even made it this far, but thank you if you did.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I want to talk about my mother a bit.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6ej4a2/i_want_to_talk_about_my_mother_a_bit/","view_count":null}

I am Jack and I am 5'11, slim and In decent shape too I guess. My hair is a dark blonde and my eyes are blue. My cock grows to around 6.5 inches when fully erect.\n\nI started fantasising about older women nearly two years ago but recently the urges have become stronger and the fantasies have been wild. I'm a virgin and would just love to have some fun with a naughty, dirty older woman on here who knows exactly how to please a guy and his cock.... I would learn so much and be blown away by your skill...\n\nI will admit it, i simply love older women who are hungry for young cock, from the women I have spoke to in the past, its definitely the ones who simply love having a young body to play with that are the most fun so if you simply adore young guys, love the fact that you're a kinky cougar and arent ashamed to admit it then bonus points for you! One of the things i love about older women is their experience, they've mostly seen it all and done it all before and know just how to drive a young guy insane, if I was to be lucky enough to be with one then they'd give me standards that no one could live up to around my age.\n\nSome of my kinks include: Blowjobs, older women, being seduced, ass, anal, face sitting, spanking, lots of cum, dirty talk and women with experience. However, I would love to explore more and learn more about the things that get my teen dick so hard....\n\nI am open to most things and am happy to either chat or roleplay! A few ideas for roles if you wanted to roleplay are\nYou are my mother's best friend\n\nWe are neighbours.\n\nYou are my mom ;)\n\nWe meet at a hotel bar and we hit it off.\n\nYou don't have to pick any of those, I am open to other ideas! If we are to roleplay then I would find it hot if you knew that I was a virgin and really loved younger guys and felt like having some fun with me.\n\nI hope to hear from someone soon!

Summary is two young sisters traveling alone are taken advantage of by two pervy security guards! If that seems like your thing, read on...\n\nKinks include oral, anal, cum, toys, group, public, petplay, watersports, etc.\n*****\n\"Hi there girls,\" the airport security officer, John, greeted the two smiling sisters as they approached him. He was middle-aged and a little seedy, the kind of guy who just loved having a job where he could feel other people up, especially young girls. He looked around, \"Where are your parents?\"\n\n\"Oh, we're traveling by ourselves!\" the younger girl announced excitedly, \"I'm Sarah and I'm 10! This is my sister Jane and she's 12.\"\n\nJohn smiled and took a moment to look over the pretty girls. They were clearly sisters, sharing the same blond hair and blue eyes, not to mention their tight little bodies. Both wore nice tight jeans and t-shirts and Sarah wore her hair in two cute braids while Jane wore hers in a sporty ponytail.\n\nJane's skin was a bit more tan than her pale younger sister as she seemed rather athletic. Jane was also taller and very clearly on the verge of puberty, she already sported little breasts poking out of her t-shirt but clearly didn't wear a bra.\n\n\"I see,\" John grinned, \"Well, I'll just need you to step through the metal detector.\"\n\nHe could tell little Sarah was just excited to be there while Jane seemed a little anxious, no doubt having to be responsible for the two of them. Sarah pranced through the metal detector without a problem but her old sister set off a loud alarm and flashing red light. \n\n\"Well that's no good,\" John grinned as he stepped over to give Jane a pat down. The tween shivered a little as the big man ran his hands over her clothed body. John took special delight in groping her budding titties through her shirt, even pinching at her puffy nipples.\n\n\"I-is something wrong?\" Jane asked, startled and uncomfortable.\n\n\"Yeah, you two are going to have to come with me,\" John said, he took Jane's hand and led the two girls far away from the rest of the people at the terminal, deep into the inaccessible part of the airport. Of course, he sent a text to his boss alerting him of the situation.\n\nIn a few moments, the girls found themselves alone with two older men in a big concrete room. There were a few chairs about the room, a large table in the center and a video camera aimed at the table.\n\n\"This is my supervisor, Frank,\" John introduced the other man, much like himself, who smiled greedily at the girls.\n\n\"Girls,\" Frank closed the door, \"Do you know what a strip search is?\"\n\nSarah looked to her older sister.\n\n\"Uhm... not exactly,\" Jane answered anxiously.\n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AgeplayPenPals","subreddit_id":"t5_3656x","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"22F4M - The Strip Search","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6ej52p/22f4m_the_strip_search/","view_count":null}

In terms of ratings, I\u2019m just going to rate on overall construction, quality of the pieces and overall price  with accuracy weighing less heavily since I\u2019m not the best LC\u2019er and I don\u2019t really want to compare my 15+ items to retail pics. For reference I'm 5'11\" and 140. On to the review! \n\n\n\n**FoG Striped S/S** | [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/ahZaZ) | [W2C]( https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=548841889378&amp;spm=1101.1101.N.N.9143b5c) | **8/10** Really nice quality tee that has that classic boxy oversized FoG look. The stiching and tags are on point and I can't really see any instant call outs. The material is some sort of cotton polyester blend and the retails are cotton and silk, but for $14 dollars definitely cop (or buy from me)\n\n**Attachment Quarter Sleeve Linen Tee** | [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/CugX9) | [W2C]( https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=531922060637&amp;spm=1101.1101.N.N.b3883ce) | **8/10** This tee is insanely nice, the stitching is perfect and the the drapes extremely nicely. Comparing it to retail it nails all the details down include the slits on the sides and on the back of the sleeves. For the price, I would definitely recommend buying. I ordered a medium, but don't buy this if you're under my height as this piece is 33\" and goes down my lower thighs.\n\n**SLP D02** | [PICS]( http://imgur.com/a/kwJYj) | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=524081606323&amp;spm=1101.1101.N.N.efca42b) | **8/10** Probably one of my favorite items of this haul despite it's shoddy construction. Pants have a slight new pants sheen to them and are a really nice fit. The tags are on point and the printed part on the inside looks quality. The button on the front is pretty faded and looks cheap and I found a couple of loose threads on the right thigh but nothing that detracts from the overall pants. Would definitely buy at this price. I wear a size 30-31 and these fit perfectly on me, skinny on the thigh and tapered with a bit of give at the calfs. These are a cotton spandex blend so they're pretty comfy and lightweight.\n\n**SLP Ripped D02** | [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/tRLhq) | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=528519877395&amp;spm=1101.1101.N.N.cf441dc) | **8/10** Rate these pants pretty similarly to the other pair as the quality and stitching is slightly better but the white tag on the inside is complete ass. Overall the pants feel like the same weight and material, but the construction is slightly better on the ripped pair than the other pants in terms of stitching. I would definitely cop these for the look but not if anyones gonna try to LC your butthole cuz the tag is a instant callout. The pants fit almost like jeggings so size one up from your TTS if you want looser fitting pants. Overall very satisfied with these pants. \n\n**Y3 Belt** | [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/gpHGa) | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=43822168202&amp;spm=1101.1101.N.N.449161d) | **10/10** Briefly LC'ed this piece for my buddy before buying and it looks pretty solid. Really impressed with this piece, for $20 dollars you get a really thick nicely embroidered belt with heavy duty metal clasps as the end. Definitely cop this if you need a belt. I'm sure you can find this for cheaper but this vendor had solid reviews and options so I just went off this guy.\n\n**Raf Simons Bunny Slides** | [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/fdxkV) | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=549117717193&amp;spm=1101.1101.N.N.5e045a8) | **8/10** Picked these up for $31 dollars and the quality on the Bunny slides is pretty decent compared to the retail ones i have pictured (black). Some differences I've noticed are that the reps have a smoother surface than the retails and that strap is a bit more plasticky and doesn't have the cotton fuzzy lining.

But basically I'm 27 and I JUST this week found out that my abusive father and step mother (hence collectively referred to as \" The Scum\") spent YEARS using my sister and I as a bludgeon against our real mother in court.  I currently live in Maine but while this was all happening we lived in Virginia.  Before then we lived further south but our father kept moving further north and away from our mother and her entire side of the family.  I also lived in Ohio with my grandparents between then and now when it became apparent that was too damaged to stay with The Scum.  Their excuse to me at the time was that they thought it was best for me, but I later found out that they were actually telling our entire neighborhood they were afraid of me and had to lock their door at night.  At that point I was basically living and being treated as a felon in my own home, and was so enraged by all the abuse that either reason would have been good justification for sending me away.\n_______________\nThe reason I only just now found out is because this is the first time I've spoken to my real mother in more than a decade.\n\nAnd the reason for THAT is that The Scum intentionally lied to us, our real mother, and the courts over the course of multiple years - They intentionally isolated us from everything else and did everything in their power to prevent her from reaching us during the entire prolonged court battle.  While simultaneously denying it in court and informing us constantly how stupid and terrible our mother was - how she didn't care about us and was trying to bankrupt them and...  and more lies than I can count.  Being foolish children we were easily brainwashed and ended up believing those lies. We came to revile our real mother.\n\nWe were never brought to any of the court cases and The Scum were careful to make sure they were our only source of information. They also intentionally withheld information requested by our mother in court such as psychiatric and academic records - stating we were perfectly healthy and fine.\n\nThe abuse didn't end there, of course.  In fact it got worse once she was out of the picture.  But my sister and I just finally spoke to our mother again after all these years, believing that we should at least give her the chance to apologize to us and... oh man.  WE need to apologize to HER instead for allowing ourselves to be some completely brainwashed.\n__________________\nI don't know if it's even possible to do anything because of the amount of time that's passed.  Even though this information is entirely new to me.  But I sincerely believe that what The Scum has done has left me emotionally crippled and had a continually destructive effect on my life.  I'm not sure if having evidence of ongoing anguish would help to counter that length of time which as passed, to name a few of the things which might help to extenuate my circumstance in light of the amount of time which has passed?\n\n* Even before finding out all of this I have had severe depression and ptsd for my entire teenage/adult life.  I take medication for this and have voluntarily sought out counseling.\n* I could get medical records from the hospital to prove that I have been suicidal.  And probably statements from my counselor/doctor that I still periodically struggle with this.\n* My long term memory is basically shot, but I could ask my sister and others to help describe the extent of the isolation, mental, and emotional abuse we suffered as children.\n* Our real mother has apparently kept nearly all of the previous court documents and photocopies of the dozens and dozens of gifts, calls, and other attempts at contact which were stonewalled.  \n* I wanted to forget about my entire life and childhood so badly that I moved multiple states away and changed my entire name first and last to try and move past it all.\n\n*I've asked her to mail these to me so that I can read through them and make sure that I'm completely certain that this revelation is, in fact, truthful before I proceed.* If so I'd be happy to swear on every Bible ever printed that I had no knowledge of any of this whatsoever until now. There's apparently so many of them it cost her nearly $150 to ship it all.\n\n.\n\nI... I don't know what else to put I'm so furious and exhausted and sick of this wretched world right now.  I thought I had made my peace with my treatment at the hands of The Scum and have even come to be on polite terms with The Scum somewhat recently and now this...","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"legaladvice","subreddit_id":"t5_2rawz","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Is it possible for a child to sue an abusive parent if they find out 5-10 years later that said parent intentionally destroyed their life in order to \"win\" a divorce?

I post here all the time, but just wanted to make a throwaway for this as it's a little personal. I am 24 and almost five months on T. I don't pass ever and am stuck in this cycle of picking every single thing about myself apart. I understand that passing takes time, but it hurts me so much that I have done everything possible and it doesn't work. I feel like giving up and say that to myself all the time, but I don't know what giving up would even mean. Sometimes I think it's just going back to living as a woman and being incredibly depressed and dysphoric/dissociate-y all the time, and other times I'm scared to think about what I really mean. \n\nI grew up with a lot of weight and food issues. I would constantly gain and lose weight with haste and never really learned how to take care of myself in that way. I went through phases of very disordered eating and exercise obsession and would starve myself to lose weight, then, when I couldn't get through the day anymore, I would start eating and gain it all back. I would lose like 50-80 pounds in two or three months and put it all and more back on. It was awful. Last Christmas, just when I was starting to realize I was interested in transitioning, I weighed 333 lbs. I am 5'11, but that's still awful. I have been losing weight (in a healthy way) over the past year and a half and now weigh around 270. I'm proud of this, but I still have huge legs and hips and wish so badly that I was thinner so that I might pass. I find myself starting to think in dangerous patterns about food and have to actively break myself from it. I don't want to put myself through that again, but it's hard when it's your default. I have such a hatred towards my body sometimes that it scares me and I wish I could wake up tomorrow thinner and without hips. \n\nI am at a standstill with everything right now. My name change is in a month, so I'm excited about that, but I worry about going into the world legally male and with a male name when I don't pass. I know that doesn't invalidate my gender, but I feel like it does sometimes. I hope it'll be easier to get hired somewhere once the name change is through, because I have had a great deal of trouble getting a job because of my transition. I have a degree, a great resume, references, the works, but it all seems to be pointless.\n\nI'm sorry to vent a bit. I'm having a really hard time. I would love to talk to other guys in their 20s or other people dealing with food issues or just anyone. I really need some friends right now. \n\nThanks for all that you do. I appreciate all of you and this community so much.\n\nTL;DR: I feel like I should be in a better place, both because of my age and the amount of time I've been on T, but am not there and it's hard.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ftm","subreddit_id":"t5_2t9mw","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Really need to talk to someone going through a similar situation (tw dysphoria/food/depression)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/6ej8rg/really_need_to_talk_to_someone_going_through_a/","view_count":null}

My bad for splitting into two posts, I thought the 40,000 character limit was 4,000! I'm 5'11\" and 145 lbs for reference. For shoe sizing I wear US8.5 or US9 in NMD PK's, US10 in UB's, EU42 in CP's, EU42 in SLP's. My waist is a US30-31, I usually for a 30 for a tighter fit.\n\n**JW Anderson Knot Tee** | [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/MqAmU) | [W2C](http://reondistrict.com/product/RD-F.-JW.sleeve-T-shirt-3color-/540/cid/54) | **7/10** Picked this up because I've always thought this piece was cool but could never justify the price. Overall pretty happy with the shirt for it's price point, as per Reon the stitching is on point and fabric is decent (100% cotton). The shirt itself is pretty basic though and I realized after having in hand how simple it is to make this out of a tailored L/S tee hence the low rating. Cop if you're into it. I went a small and this fits perfect for a tight fit to wear with skinny jeans.\n\n**Gucci Jordaan Loafers** | [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/YAHvq) | [W2C](http://reondistrict.com/product/RD-Jordaan-Loafers/702/cid/67) | **8/10** for the price I was expecting a pretty premium product but in terms of quality it was pretty lackluster. It uses real calfskin leather but it's bit slimmer than retail which causes it crease easily, the creases you see on my shoes are after 2-3 wears. On foot, everything is extremely accurate but the sole is not even close to retail so don't try to pass this off as real. I'd say this is worth ~$120-140. I'm still pretty happy with the shoe in terms of looks and material as it does use real leather but only buy this if you can't find a alternative. I recommend going a full size down instead of the half if you want to rock no shows, otherwise follow their sizing guide.\n\n**SLP Chelseas** | [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/TErqv) | [W2C](http://reondistrict.com/product/RD-S.Classic-Chelsea-boots-Black-suede-/616/cid/67) | **9/10** so these are expensive as fuck and come in around $260. The suede is extremely nice and much nicer than any low tier/middle tier shoe I owned. Compared to my retail SLP suede shoes the suede on the rep is a bit coarser/rough and doesn't have that buttery feeling to it. In terms of accuracy the shape is pretty nice with the exception of the arches caving in when worn and the back part of the heel sticking out slightly. Similarly to the Gucci loafs, I would buy these if you want the highest quality suede SLP rep and can't find any alternatives. Personally I would put these at around $180-$200. Followed their sizing guide and fits perfectly.\n\n**FoG 4th Inside Out Tees** | [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/Ojxsm) | [W2C](http://imgur.com/a/Ojxsm) | **8/10** The fit and accuracy of the tags on the top are pretty accurate and the quality is pretty decent. The cotton is pretty thin though which is why I gave it a low rating, but in terms of personal opinion these are a 10/10 for me. Extremely versatile tee that drapes insanely well and can be paired with streetwear or high fashion fits. Went a small and fits like a boxy medium. \n\n**Balenciaga Logo Windbreaker** | [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/usjBN) | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=545973328877&amp;spm=1101.1101.N.N.d494ea7) | **9.5/10** This is my hands down favorite piece of this haul. The logo sizing and placement is accurate and they use real tags on the inside. The zipper they use is some cheap chinese zipper but the rest of the jacket is on point. 100% recommend buying. Overall quality is decent but you can't really make a nylon windbreaker that quality. Went medium and fits like a boxy medium.\n\n**Burberry Dress Shirt** | [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/scrGJ) | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=43736372076&amp;spm=1101.1101.N.N.16d8787) | **4/10** This piece is pretty bad in terms of construction. The material they use is extremely thin and the stitching on the sleeves is terrible. In terms of overall looks though I'd say it's a 7/10 but man is the overall construction shit. I would definitely not recommend unless you need a burberry shirt. \n\n**FoG 3rd Inside Out** | [Pics](http://imgur.com/a/piUYH) | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=534907086096&amp;spm=1101.1101.N.N.9a54184) | **10/10** Really nice tee, the mix of colors looks really premium and the accuracy is 1:1 I believe. stitching and construction is on point and the material they used is the thickest of all the tees I bought in my haul, definite cop. \n\n**Part 1**\n\n**FoG Striped S/S** | [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/ahZaZ) | [W2C]( https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=548841889378&amp;spm=1101.1101.N.N.9143b5c) | **8/10** Really nice quality tee that has that classic boxy oversized FoG look. The stiching and tags are on point and I can't really see any instant call outs. The material is some sort of cotton polyester blend and the retails are cotton and silk, but for $14 dollars definitely cop (or buy from me)\n\n**Attachment Quarter Sleeve Linen Tee** | [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/CugX9) | [W2C]( https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=531922060637&amp;spm=1101.1101.N.N.b3883ce) | **8/10** This tee is insanely nice, the stitching is perfect and the the drapes extremely nicely. Comparing it to retail it nails all the details down include the slits on the sides and on the back of the sleeves. For the price, I would definitely recommend buying. I ordered a medium, but don't buy this if you're under my height as this piece is 33\" and goes down my lower thighs.\n\n**SLP D02** | [PICS]( http://imgur.com/a/kwJYj) | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=524081606323&amp;spm=1101.1101.N.N.efca42b) | **8/10** Probably one of my favorite items of this haul despite it's shoddy construction. Pants have a slight new pants sheen to them and are a really nice fit. The tags are on point and the printed part on the inside looks quality. The button on the front is pretty faded and looks cheap and I found a couple of loose threads on the right thigh but nothing that detracts from the overall pants. Would definitely buy at this price. I wear a size 30-31 and these fit perfectly on me, skinny on the thigh and tapered with a bit of give at the calfs. These are a cotton spandex blend so they're pretty comfy and lightweight.\n\n**SLP Ripped D02** | [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/tRLhq) | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=528519877395&amp;spm=1101.1101.N.N.cf441dc) | **8/10** Rate these pants pretty similarly to the other pair as the quality and stitching is slightly better but the white tag on the inside is complete ass. Overall the pants feel like the same weight and material, but the construction is slightly better on the ripped pair than the other pants in terms of stitching. I would definitely cop these for the look but not if anyones gonna try to LC your butthole cuz the tag is a instant callout. The pants fit almost like jeggings so size one up from your TTS if you want looser fitting pants. Overall very satisfied with these pants. \n\n**Y3 Belt** | [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/gpHGa) | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=43822168202&amp;spm=1101.1101.N.N.449161d) | **10/10** Briefly LC'ed this piece for my buddy before buying and it looks pretty solid. Really impressed with this piece, for $20 dollars you get a really thick nicely embroidered belt with heavy duty metal clasps as the end. Definitely cop this if you need a belt. I'm sure you can find this for cheaper but this vendor had solid reviews and options so I just went off this guy.\n\n**Raf Simons Bunny Slides** | [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/fdxkV) | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=549117717193&amp;spm=1101.1101.N.N.5e045a8) | **8/10** Picked these up for $31 dollars and the quality on the Bunny slides is pretty decent compared to the retail ones i have pictured (black). Some differences I've noticed are that the reps have a smoother surface than the retails and that strap is a bit more plasticky and doesn't have the cotton fuzzy lining. Overall though very satisfied with this purchase and I don't think anyone could call you out these. The retail adidas came in a near identical box with the chinese factory smell so I'd probably buy the reps over retails. Bought these in a EU42 and they fit perfectly.\n\nWaiting to be shipped to warehouse: SLP chain ring, SLP Hawaiin, Dior Homme pants, Oliver People Glasses, 11 by BBS hoodie/tees, 17ss Valentino Sneakers, Givenchy Leather knots.\n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DesignerReps","subreddit_id":"t5_3g0q1","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[REVIEW] wellf's haul part 2 - Reondistrict JW Anderson, Gucci loafers, SLP chelseas and FoG Inside Out, Balenciaga Windbreaker, Burberry Dress Shirt","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignerReps/comments/6ejf1r/review_wellfs_haul_part_2_reondistrict_jw/","view_count":null}

My shopping experience surfaced a lot of feelings I didn't expect. An older gentleman working in the archery section - who had fixed my compound a few times in the past - walked with me through a few aisles as we discussed whether it was worth waiting for better discounts on some non scent detergent and a few other items. We hit a bunch of subjects (ozone, 2 or 3 blade broadheads, how expensive the vaginal secretion ingredient is for the high end evercalm stick), and shared a few hunting stories. I bet that guy has enjoyed his time with a lot of the customers. Maybe the hometown bow shop isn't as common as it used to be, but every now and then you get a competent enthusiast, even at a big box store, and that's nice. I bought a pair of guide series stretch early season archery camo gloves 40% off. You know, I wore a guide series pant + jacket combo that lasted for at least ten years, warm and waterproof the entire time, and probably cost me $150 total brand new. I don't care what anybody says guide series has delivered millions of comfortable hunts to people at a great value. I'm 38 now, and I wonder how many times I popped into Gander Mountain in the past 15 or 20 years to stock up on something. I wonder how much money I've spent on gear and consumables. And yes there's a changing business model, and I'm on amazon as much as the next guy, but I'm sure a lot of hard working people dumped their lives into making Gander Mountain what it is. More and more, our purchases are not going to be made with a human interaction, other than reading some reviews or back n forth with strangers on a forum. At the same time, I've never had so much access to quality hunting information as I do now, via Reddit, Facebook, hunting beast, etc. and I've gone off the deep end with habitat management in the past few years. This hunting thing is evolving so much over time, and it's interesting to look back and think about all the slow and steady changes. AND ITS MORE A CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE THAN ITS EVER BEEN. Want to close in on a buck in its bed? Somebody can tell you how. Want to grow soybeans? Somebody can help. Elk in CO? There's 100 websites on that. It is crazy, and particularly since the late 90s, technology seems to be changing the way we experience hunting  exponentially. And yet nature feels almost exactly the same. I hope a lot of younger folks on here stay with it; it will teach you patience and give you lots of opportunities - if you look for them - to interact with a lot of interesting people, some where you least expect it. I've met a few really awesome people right in this sub. Also... be ready to suck at whatever type of hunting you do, for a long time, unless your cousin has a perfect duck blind that you can sit in. But that will be, in some way, less rewarding than the skill you work to learn. It's a marathon not a sprint; but at the same time, be curious and as clever as you can, and learn as fast as you can. As you get better - which will take time - it will get more and more rewarding and you will have more friends to share it with. Particularly if you haven't started a family yet, man get after it, this is the time to pack in the memories, shared with as many people as you can include. Ultimately it's the people, whether they're sitting in an archery / bait shop in 1993 tweaking your bow string, or they're filming you in HD from a tree stand next to you in 2017, that you will remember the most. Get weird with it everybody, and thanks Gander Mountain for outfitting a lot of my hunting for 20 years.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Hunting","subreddit_id":"t5_2qlkx","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Sentimental Gander Mountain Rambling","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hunting/comments/6ejhdi/sentimental_gander_mountain_rambling/","view_count":null}

I only paid $10 for the ID so I just walked away.\n\nWell little did I know that the bar where my id was confiscated turns over all of the fakes they take to the local police. 2 months after my id was taken, I receive a letter from an officer at the Champagne Police Department saying he has my id and that I have been fined $340.00 and my driver's license will be suspended for a year. \n\nHe added that if I pay the fine and talk with him about where I got the id (I got it online), then my charge will only go down as a city fine and will not appear on my criminal record.  but he's suspending my license reguardless.\n\nI can't talk with the guy until Thursday because he's not in the office until then, so my question for you all is: by \"not on my criminal record\", does he mean that if a future employer does a background check on me, this charge will in no way come up?\n\nI ask because when I told my parents, they said it was bullshit and that they should hire a lawyer for me to fight it.

It took them months to even send me a letter. They are not slamming all of us kids with felonies. Half of the students at U of I would be felons otherwise.

The incident that nearly had me screaming to get the fuck out of my house was when I tried to replace sheets on a bed and she kept asking me if I needed assistance and whining about it.  \n\nToday, (right now!) my brother J is graduating from high school and getting to the ceremony was very difficult as there was like no place to park and stuff. We're sitting in the nosebleeds right now and she's refusing to sit next to us. So passive-aggressive.

I decided to take a test because my boobs had been hurting and I was spotting a lot longer and sooner than I usually do before a period. I was spotting and I never really stopped. I went into the ER and my OB a few times, my HCG kept going up but I kept bleeding. A few ultrasounds later my OB confirmed it was not a viable pregnancy. He prescribed Cytotec to get things started. April 10th my HCG finally naturally hit zero, I spotted on and off for two weeks.  About a month later my period started just about right on time, a couple days after my Ovia app sad it would start. \n\nI have questions:\n\n1. When do you count the first day of your miscarriage? The day your pregnancy was deemed non-viable? When your HCG started going down? Or when it hit 0? Or when your bleeding I stopped?\n\n2.

It just recently clicked in the past few weeks that my struggles might be related to ADHD.\n\nEver since I was young I've always had a hard time staying on task, concentrating on school work etc.  Often times when I'm talking to someone (even though they're right in front of me without any other people or distractions present), my mind wanders involuntarily and I totally miss what the person was saying.  My parents took me to ENT specialists and had me do several hearing tests when I was younger because I would constantly repeat questions after being told the answer several times BC my mind jumped to something else while they were answering me.  Every time my hearing was perfectly fine.\n\n\nI also have other symptoms, like struggling to pay attention during classes, during work, struggling to complete tasks that should be relatively easy and straight forward.  I'm easily distracted by little things all around me.  I find it difficult to find initiative to start a task or stark working towards a goal, if it seems like it will be a lot of trouble, my mind will shut off and focus on something else.  I'm constantly fidgeting, tapping, making noise, \"beat boxing\" etc.\n \n\nI know that the answer is to go see a doctor.  I just don't know how to go about that.  I'm 30, about to be 31, do I just go tell my primary care doctor hey I think I have ADHD can you refer me to someone?  Is that kind of silly to say at 30?  Do I need to see a psychiatrist or a psychologist?\n\nMy entire life I've been labeled as lazy, lacking initiative etc from family, how do I avoid/deal with the inevitable \"you're just trying to find excuses for your laziness\" etc?\n\nAny help/advice greatly appreciated.\n\n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ADHD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnwb","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I think I've had ADHD my entire life, trying to get some feedback and guidance.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/6ejlv2/i_think_ive_had_adhd_my_entire_life_trying_to_get/","view_count":null}

I'm 27 and I've been in denial about my sexuality my entire life. So it ended up me never dating anyone ever. Hoping the feelings would go away. Obviously they didn't and I've come to accept that recently. My family without a doubt will disown me when I tell them. They've told me that on many occasions and tried to force me to get therapy because they were worried if I don't date that any gay friends will try and convert me. They think very backwards and caused a big distance between my family.\n\nOnto things going on now. Recently I downloaded a dating app and have been seeing this guy for almost 2 months now. I'm trying to take things very slow with him and he's been fine with it so far. I didn't kiss him until our third date. We've had some fun together even if my nerves got to me occasionally. We go on dates whenever we can (at least once a week), meet up for lunches, I've spent the night at his place, go on double dates with his friends and all that good stuff. Truthfully I've never been happier. So this is where my first question comes into play. I'm not ready to say it to him but I'm falling for him hard and I think I might be in love. Now, I'm trying to get this all straight in my head. How can I be sure what I feel is real and not just because this the first guy I've been with. Before I met him I did go on one date but we didn't connect and talked to so many guys online that also had no connection. \n\nNow for the second part of my problem. I live with my parents currently until I decide on my schooling future. So at max I'll live with them for a year. He's out to his family and I've met them and they are really nice to me. The only thing I  asked him was to not tag me in any photos on Facebook. I have no problem with being out with him and showing affection. We hold hands in public so I'm not hiding him fully because I don't worry who would see.  The only time it was an issue was I invited him to a concert and got him tickets. The day of my brothers decided to go with me. I told him they would be there and said that I wouldn't be able to be affectionate with him but I still wanted him to go. He declined to go after that. The next day we met and he said he felt bad for not going. I told him not to worry about it. I don't blame him and im not mad at him. I'm upset with myself. I can see myself ruining something amazing. I hate myself for this and the only way to fix it is to come out. I will come out but I'm hoping when I do it won't be too late. He says he understands but he shouldn't have to understand. I'm more upset about this than I think he is. \n\nMy depression throughout my life led to me never having friends or dates. So the moment I started dating him my family became suspicious. They try to be super controlling to me still at 27. When they ask where I go I say I'm hanging with friends. Then they found my bf on Facebook and seen he was gay. They gave me a long lecture on how if I hang with him he will turn me gay. That gay people go to hell. Stuff like that. Everytime I go out I get my mom crying at me asking me not to go hang out with my gay friend. When I spent the night they wanted to know where he lived in case of an emergency. I declined and later I found out they stalked him online and found where he lived. Everytime I come home I get lectures from my parents asking if I'm gay and if I am they will pay for counseling and that I will be disowned or give them a heart attack. I've pulled so far away from my family I hardly even talk to them and they try to push closer to me. So everytime I go out with my bf I am making a huge sacrifice. For him I'm willing to suffer. I hope he understands I'm only doing this because I care for him that much. \n\nSo yes I will have to come out to my family. But it can only happen when I move back out. Once I do I know that they won't talk to me and I've accepted that. \n\nSo what can I do in the meantime to show him how much I care and how much I struggle.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"askgaybros","subreddit_id":"t5_2vgfw","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Need some honest opinions about a new boyfriend and coming out.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/6ejlxl/need_some_honest_opinions_about_a_new_boyfriend/","view_count":null}

In Dec 2016, I graduated with a master's degree in public administration and policy. In June 2009, I earned a bachelor's in poli sci. Right now, I am completing a temporary internship with local government (under city administrator) and hoping to transition into a full-time public job within the next 1-2 mos. I am super confused about loan repayment and hoping someone here can possibly help!  \n\nHere is info on my loan situation.

Hopefully, my next job will be about 50-60k. I most likely will be in the public sector and work toward PSLF (if available...), but I'm not 100% positive on public vs private so don't want to fully bank on PSLF.    \n\n* Also to note - I am 30 yrs old, live in MN, married. We file separately due to her being a teacher (60k salary) and in year 3 of PAYE repayment, working toward PSLF.     \n    \n\n\nAny ideas how to move forward? Do I need to consolidate to a certain loan provider or do anything special if I want to possibly do IBR and/or PSLF? Are either of these providers decent or better than the other? I'm feeling really overwhelmed and Navient isn't much help on the phone or on their website :(  \n\nThank you for any guidance!!

My parents were really abusive and there's alot i do not remember. But I'm starting to remember things that strongly suggest that my father sexually abused me, but no specific memories of the actual abuse occuring (if that makes any sense). Here are some of the memories I have managed to piece together. \n\n--When I was 11 I had really bad pain in my vagina. I told my mom, she said it was a yeast infection and would go away in a few days. I'm now 22 and looked online and talked to my doctor--that wasn't a yeast infection, but my doctor said the pain I described would be from sexual trauma. \n\n--11 is also the age that I became depressed and developed a severe eating disorder. It's also when my mother started becoming extremely abusive. She would tell me she hated me, hit me, etc. This is corroborated by looking back at childhood diaries. Up until age 11 I was a happy kid with minimal conflict with my parents. \n\n--I remember having nightmares about an evil doctor coming into my room and molesting me when I was younger (I do not remember the age these happened, but I know it was before age 13 for sure). \n\n--When I was older, like 17, I wanted to see the doctor but my parents would often refuse me medical treatment. I did some research online and read that women who have yeast infections usually get more than one. I lied and said I had a yeast infection, figuring since she knew I had one at 11, that she would take me to the doctor without too much trouble. Instead, she got furious, and accused me of being sexually active and insinuated I was a whore. Looking back, this is strange because according to my doctor and the internet, yeast infections are not caused by sex. So it's weird that she associated that. (As another aside, I have never experienced pain like that \"yeast infection\" ever again--which also supports my doctors claim that it was from sexual trauma)\n\n--Also, I have a distinct memory of my dad leaving porn out where I could see it (on his desk in the study, in plain view, where he KNEW I went). Looking back, this seems intentional. If not intentional, then extremely careless. \n\n--I also have instances of covert sexual abuse from both my parents--but I won't go into that now.\n\n--I also have implicit memories of sexual abuse--I have a fear (to the point of being hyper vigilant and unnecessarily untrusting) that I will be sexually assaulted. I also have frequent nightmares of being sexually assaulted, and I am very, very, weird about sex. I also get triggered from discussions about rape/sexual abuse. \n\n--I wet the bed until about age 12\n\n--When my doctor went to do my first vaginal exam, I had a panic attack. I didn't understand why I was so uncomfortable or where this was coming from. But I just lost it. \n\n--However, most damning of all, I have a diary entry from around the same time I remember having the vaginal pain that just says \"Dad can be dangerous\". This is noticeably different from my other entries, where I write loooonngggg entries and talk about friends and stuff. He is also the only person I ever refer to as dangerous. I call alot of people 'mean' in my diaries, and I refer to my mom as 'unfair' but that's all. This entry stands out to me. It is also that entry marks a distinct changing point in my emotional state. While the entries leading up to that one are happy and superficial, the ones after show a significant drop in self-esteem (I start calling myself fat) and I start talking about conflicts with my mom, feeling worthless, and how depressed I am. \n\n--I am terrified of my father and have told my therapist that I am scared he will track me down and kidnap/murder me. She thought I was being ridiculous...until she started to hear about these memories. Now she says that if it was him who sexually abused me, that explains the fear. \n\n--My mom HATED me, starting around age 11, and if my dad abused me, it might explain why...\n\n--There might be more but that's all I can remember for now. Any thoughts or advice? Am I imagining things, or do these memories indicate that my dad sexually abused me? My doctor thinks someone did, and I can't think of anyone else who had that sort of access to me. \n\n\nHas anyone else started remembering things way after the situation ended?? I'm 22 and this all would have been stuff that happened in 6th grade....is this normal?

I would like to hear about people's experiences trying relationships, dating, or even casual sexual relationships after rape/assault. What did the timeline look like for you? What was your healing process? When did you decide you were \"ready\" to put yourself back out into the world?\n\nMy story: almost a year ago I was raped by 2 acquaintances at a party, I don't remember any of it. When I put all of the pieces together later (people were not truthful with me for many months), I was still with my boyfriend who I had been seeing for about 4 years. I'm only 20 and we had been dating since high school; this event, growing apart and some other outside factors put a large strain on our relationship. I felt he was not very supportive or respectful of my healing process/boundaries. We officially ended things about 2 weeks ago. I had been feeling extremely trapped and utterly uninterested in the relationship for several months but was waiting for the \"right time\" to break it off (end of semester). I felt a confusing mix of guilty emotions during this time - guilt because I felt my experience could be ruining our relationship and causing me to feel uninterested, but also guilt because my eye was wandering a bit and I started thinking guys around me were attractive again (hadn't felt this way in many months about anyone, including my boyfriend). \n\nNow that we've ended things it's like a breath of fresh air. I'm excited for new possibilities, but i'm worried I'm not giving myself enough \"time\" and even going on a date with someone else right now might be completely overwhelming and nerve-wracking. I know for sure my mother would be furious with me if I did that, she told me straight up \"no boys for at least 6 months\". Ok, she's not crazy I promise - I'm 20, I'll do what I want, but we're very close and I take her advice seriously. I've had this crazy mix of emotions the past few days... feeling lonely, but not missing my ex; wanting to take control of my life again and enjoy sex, but not really having anyone I feel comfortable enough with to try; so much anxiety and anger about dating and this \"baggage\" and \"oh god no man will ever love me again because of this\" anxiety attacks. I guess I haven't been truly single for that long and it would be foolish to date right now... I'm really afraid of becoming a person who doesn't know how to be alone. \n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant, just kind of wanted to get my crazy feelings out there. Maybe someone can relate. I hate that this subject is so taboo and hardly spoken about, the lack of resources about the sexual healing process is astounding!

They leave, I don't really put much thought into it, I'd never seen her before, so it's whatever. This was right before eighth\u200b grade.\n\nFirst day of freshman year, I walk into homeroom, and I see her again, and she's just everything I swear. I see her and it's just one of those I'm in love feelings, I've never felt it before, but I like it, so I ride with the feeling. Over the course of a few months, I talk to her, get to know her, generally become acquainted with her. I'm getting them vibes that she's at least semi into me, I trust these vibes as I'm usually good at picking these things up, so I guess one could say I gave myself a little confidence boost. \n\nFlash forward a bit, it's almost Valentine's day, and my school had a dance. I'm thinking, this is a perfect opportunity to ask her out right? Sort of cliche I guess, but it's Valentine's, it's a dance, I think it's a good idea. We show up, we dance, so on we have a good night. I go home feeling really good, she's basically the girl of my dreams (still is). \nThe next day of school, it's like she shut me out man. I didn't get a hi, how are you, nothing. I didn't exist. That fucked me up man, I thought things were going good and shit, but nah, I get hit with this bullshit.\n\nAt first I don't think much of it, I thought, \"maybe she's playing hard to get,\" I really hoped I was right. But, I was not. This wasn't a little move on her part, I was just non existent. I think a good month or so passed, when I finally decided to tell how how I truly felt, I was more than positive that she already know I liked her, but I thought spilling my heart out to her would somehow changed something. \n\nI wrote fucking paragraphs, what I sent her was my complete and utter vulnerability and love for her, something I couldn't even say in person because I wouldn't have had the brain power to put it into words, I spent time and effort into this. I sent it to her at around midnight, I sorta hoped she was asleep, so I had time to prepare myself. Turns out she was awake, and I was left on read. I gave her a free minutes, as it was a decent bit to read. It was ten minutes later or so, when I sent her something along the lines of, \"no words?\" When I found out that she had turned her phone off, or something like that. My heart sunk to my stomach I swear, I just knew that couldn't have been good. About half an hour later, she replies with one sentence that I'll never forget, \"I only see you as a friend.\" What hurt me even more though\u200b was that I knew I wasn't even a friend to her. She didn't treat me like a friend after the dance, I'm almost positive that I could disappear at any point in time, and she probably wouldn't notice/care.\n\nAt some point towards the end of freshman year, my English teacher had us wrote poems (she was in my English class). I put my heart and soul into this, and the end result was something I'm happy with I guess. I knew she would be listening, so I created it to project how I was feeling, at this point I didn't even care if it was gonna make things worse or not. I went up to present and holy shit I was nervous, I couldn't stop glancing at her over and over. I finally start reading:\n\n\"When I first met Cupid, he wore a mask of loneliness. I\u2019d grown accustomed to his prolonged presence; I didn\u2019t think about it twice.\n\nCupid, is by no means, a bad person. He has the greatest of intents, but with such a great power, there must also be a great responsibility.\n\nIt was when I gazed upon one of such finesse, of such beauty, that Cupid tore off his mask, and reached for his quiver of sorrow, to draw upon an arrow of love.\n\nAnd well, Cupid wasn\u2019t very responsible, I wish I could\u2019ve told him that this wasn\u2019t the one, I wish I would\u2019ve known.\n\nWe don\u2019t always get what we want.\n\nAt that moment I had but one wish; that he would pierce her heart.\n\nBut he was now gone, nothing remained but the mask of loneliness, and the longing for something more.\"\n\nI'm more than positive she knew I was talking about her. The last period of that day, I'm talking to a friend about her, (this friend is also friends with my crush) and that's when I found out that she did in fact have some sort of feelings for me in the beginning. When I found out, I felt like absolute shit. I started doubting myself, thinking I'm not good enough, I fucked up, I should've acted sooner, so on, I guess I still think that now :/.\n\nBy this time, freshman year is coming to an end, and I just tell myself I'll be over her by the time sophomore year starts, I just need the summer to chill and forget about her. These two months pass, I don't really do much, just straight Dark Souls, Destiny, Netflix and sleep. Summer passes pretty quickly. \n\nFirst day of Sophomore year, and hey, would you look at that; she's in my first period class again : ). She's now the first thing I see every morning (since she never fails to capture my gaze, she just looks so damn good), to remind me of what could've been. I've been trying to forget about her, but it's like I'm not capable of doing so, I feel like my soul needs her. At this point it's kind of annoying, because I could see these girls that are hot as fuck, but they just aren't as attractive anymore, because of her. It also doesn't help that she has a boyfriend and shit, it's just straight jealousy, like seriously fuck that guy, I know damn well I'll treat her 10000000x better than this asshole (I don't even know the guy).\n\nNow we get to present time, what made me write this was the need to just get the fuck over it. I've been told this so many times, but I try and try, and yet here I am, almost two years head over heals obsessed with this girl. It just sucks that I would literally do anything for this girl, and she has no idea. It pains me when she isn't happy. I could feel her vibes, I just noticed she wasn't herself, and she was wearing sunglasses and I just knew she was crying, and that just destroyed me inside. I wish I could just hug her and just generally comfort her but damn. I'm 16, and generally horny, like any other 16 year old is, but more often than not, when I think of her, I don't think of sex, or anything of the sort. I just think of a world where she's simply happy with my presence, and this is what destroys me the most.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationship_advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0cn","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I've been trying to move on","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6ejyfu/ive_been_trying_to_move_on/","view_count":null}

This is coming from my phone-\n\n And this happened last night... sorry for wall of text you're about to see. \n\n Let me start this off by saying it is currently summer break, I'm 15 years old, just finished my sophomore year of high school and will be a junior next year. I was playing baseball and football, but dropped football to focus and put everything into baseball because that's the only thing I'm somewhat decent at. \n \n So lets see. Around February this year, I joined a teammate doing workouts in his family's indoor facility. Nothing special, got a couple kids from the team and got to work. Then we had baseball tryouts coming up for our baseball season, so we had a schedule where some days were workouts and some were baseball things such as batting, infield. Just the normal stuff to get us back into it. Well, I play 3rd, 1st and I pitch. I started on varsity as a freshman pitching and rotating in at 3rd (I'm going to put this here: I used to wear arm sleeves for the looks. Remember this). So on our baseball days we started doing infield so I would stretch, warm up, and head on over to 3rd base to start fielding ground balls (We had a senior 1st baseman who was basically a lock so I knew I wasn't going to be there). Everything is going good, I'm fielding and throwing just fine. Now these kinda days go on for a couple weeks...\n \n Eventually I starting getting a slight discomfort on the inside of my elbow. Being the high school teenager I am, \"ah lets just take some ibuprofen and I'll be good\". Now I still wear the arm sleeve for looks, had worn one since I was 12. So I just kept taking throwing and throwing with it. Yeah, stupid. I know. At this point it's starting to become a struggle to throw the ball at 75% velocity. So I finally decided to tell my dad. He tells Billy (fake name. Guy who owns the facility.) and Billy starts watching me closer. Sweet. Well tryouts come and go, not even a tryout for us returners, we went and threw the ball maybe 5 times before coach told us to go. Baseball season starts and in our coaches speech, \"I never have any arm problems on my team\"... yeah you can see how this goes. I start trying to get back into my full velocity but it isn't working. At this point it's about the beginning of march. So finally our schools trainer looks at it and accuses me of \"bad throwing motion\". Total bs. I've been taught by professionals and many others. (He later corrected his statement when my mom talked to him about it). So my mom talked to my high school baseball coach and halfway through practice my mom calls to tell me to head home we are going to a doctor. Yay. (I have a learners permit with a hardship. Allows me to drive to school and back.) \n \n So I go to the doctor, they do X-rays to make sure I haven't fractured anything or any of the like. 2 hours later I'm diagnosed with medial epicondylitis \"golfers elbow\". Remember when I said I wore arm sleeves for looks? Yeah, I was prescribed one for legit medical reasons. Interesting huh. Sit 6 weeks and should be good. Now I hadn't thrown for about 2 weeks now because my coach told me to lay off. So I sit 3 weeks. 2 plus 3 is 5. I didn't throw 5 of 6 weeks. I start lightly throwing with my coach. Everything is fine. After another probably 2 weeks, I'm at the point of lightly tossing the throws from 3rd to 1st. Everything is going great. I start the first game of the season. First pitch. Kid lays a bunt down the 3rd base line. Bare hand and sidearm throw. He's out. No pain. Sweet. Couple innings later, routine ground ball. Throw sails high and I'm on the ground holding my arm. Gnarly. Get taken out. This was the point I became DH. Then I started playing. I've just been going through the pain. It eventually died down. My high school baseball team was 2nd in conference, 2nd in district, then we lost first round of regionals 8-2. The team we lost to ended up winning state 12-0. \n \n So this brings us to summer baseball. I'm throwing yeah yeah all the stuff. (Let me point out I never pitched on the high school team). All the practices have been slight discomfort but oh well it's fine. The head coach of this team is Billy (guy who owns facility. So he knows my arm problems. And his son played on the high school team too). Well first game of the year, winning 4-1. He asks me to pitch 2 innings. Not that much. I say \"I know I can 1 but I don't know about a second.\" First inning I pitch, 3 up 3 down, a fly ball, ground ball, and strike out. 13 pitches. 2nd inning I pitch.... hit the first guy. I can feel pain. \"Alright I got this\" next guy gets a hit. Then a double. At this point I'm having to set my glove down and do stretches I was told to do by doctors. Coach still doesn't care. Walk the next guy. 4-3. Finally get taken out. Cant move my arm. Coach says \"how's your arm\"... my response was \"hurts worse then I does when I was first told what was wrong with it\". Walk off to get my 1st base mitt (I play 1st and 3rd on this team) and my dad in the dugout (with the guy who runs our whole team organization next to him) goes \"How's your arm\" and I say \"hurts pretty freaking bad considering I can barely move it\" then the guy who runs it all just goes \"shit.
