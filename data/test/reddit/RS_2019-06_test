You can scroll ahead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI like to think I'm aware of what's waiting for me ahead. I'm 22, I dropped out of school, I've never worked and I've been isolating myself for the past 5 years... there's no way I'll have a decent life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI say isolate, but that's not entirely true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live with my family and I don't have a room so I'm alone only in the bathroom. I even go outside with a friend, even if it is only 5 or 6 times a year, attend the local cosplay con once a year and go to my father's for some days twice a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe fact is, I can't even show how I feel for one moment. I can't be honest with my family so I'm faking happiness, without even doing it right, and that's kinda tiring. \n\nI could be honest with my friend, but she has a lot of problem of her own so I don't wanna burden her with mine, she can't even help me so I'd just make her worry.\n\nAt the con and with my father is even worse. I don't really know how to approach people, so I kinda have created a fake personality to exhibit in such occasions, but people try to befriend me and I'm not strong enough to stop them so I just let myself be dragged... after the con reality hits back, I lose contact with those I met and feel incredibly shitty about myself as a result, thus my self hate keeps growing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for my father, I've piled up a huge number of lies and the only way to not make everything crumble is to keep lying... I do feel bad doing it to my father but there's no way back, I even told him I graduated from high school! As things stand now, I can't go and casually say I've told him a bunch of bullshit for years and that my life is actually shit but I'm fully aware that one day everything will be destroyed...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe solution to all my problems, even partly those with my father, is far too known to me: go out and work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSadly in my country even to clean the stairs they want an high school degree, that cuts me off from about 90% of the jobs, and that's just the least of my problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm paralized by fear, so there's no way I can just go out and work. I'm scared of changing the fragile balance that's created in my house and, since what I'm afraid the most is confrontation with other people, the only thought of doing something that's different from my usual routine terrifies me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other problem I have is that I can't bear the thought of spending my life doing something I hate. I know I'll never have my dream job and that I'm far too miserable and ugly to find a lover, but if i leave those out what's left?\n\nIn the best case I'll get a job I'll hate that makes me scrape through life until retirement, when I'll be too tired and empty to do anything but wait for death quietly.\n\nIn the most realistic scenario I'm just gonna have to nurse my relatives all my life and live off their money like a parasyte.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe fear problem is gonna solve itself, for better or worse, in a few months when I'll move in another city and my family will kick my ass towards employement, and since I'm a spineless coward, I'm gonna quietly obey.\n\nThe other one still remains though, how can I accept the shitty life that awaits me? I've already crushed my dream, suffocated my hopes and negated my wishes, but it worked only partly and didn't even resolve a thing, it just hurts a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm gonna ask all those of you that have experienced life more than me, is there a way to accept life? Am I just automatically stop thinking about it while working my ass off? Should I keep destroying myself by exposing me to all that stuff I've been avoiding because it hurts until I'm an empty shell? (By the way, the last one is what I'm currently doing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore you reply therapy or something similar, that's not an option. That would man face my family and there's no way I can do it. Online therapy also isn't an option, as I said before I can't really hide stuff in my house, even for writing this I had to leave another browser page in background to switch to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you fear I might commit suicide don't worry. I am depressed and suicidal, but I'm not gonna end my suffering to make more people suffer, I'd rather keep the pain for myself.\n\nThanks for staying with me for this gigantic rant, kudos for your patience. I usually don't say how I feel online, as it makes me feel like I'm looking for somebody to pity me and that makes me hate myself even more, but since life's gonna hit me soon I thought I might've asked for once.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"whatsbotheringyou","subreddit_id":"t5_2xvyd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/whatsbotheringyou","subreddit_subscribers":8122,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"How can I accept the life that awaits me?","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/whatsbotheringyou\/comments\/bveqiv\/how_can_i_accept_the_life_that_awaits_me\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

While I have most of my money in the stock market, my goal is to have a low-maintenance investment that I can eventually manage upon graduating law school and potentially grow into a bigger project. I have accumulated a fair amount of research on the local self-storage market in my area as well as nationwide. Moreover, I have met with a land developer and he seemed to think the market was niche because developers are building apartments at a high rate in the area. \n\nThroughout my preliminary research process, I have encountered conflicting data on whether self-storage is a profitable investment. On the one hand, I come across reddit users and databases suggesting that I am 15 years late to the self-storage party and that it would be fiscally-wise to keep my money in the stock market. In part, this may be due to other variables, rather than the market itself, or an investor wanting to make more than a \"small profit,\" which is the route I am interested in pursing. On the other hand, data has shown that there is still a high and growing demand for self-storage units because of low percentage of home ownership in recent years, a growing number of individuals renting apartments, and the frequency at which individuals move. Thus, my question is: Does anyone have any insight or information on the market trend for self-storage? If so, would it be smarter for me to keep my money in the stock market or is the self-storage market more lucrative? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, If I were to choose the self-storage path, is the smarter decision starting my own company or franchising from an REIT? As for my personal notes on having my own start-up, I have a few potential business partners in mind that would be willing to manage and market the company.

I have gone to customers and handled our vending machines\/their tool cribs as needed.  I am sort of a jack of all trades for the branch.  I know how to do everything.   I am very fast on computers.  I'm fast at picking things up and currently work 45 hours a week.\n\nI am looking to just get a decent job down in Florida while I work on going to school for something.  (Not too sure what I want to go for.  I'm interested in a lot of things.  Business\/Accounting are the big ones right now.  Alternatively learning how to become an electrician is on my radar as well.)\n\nWhat do you suggest I do?  I have manager experience in restaurants other than this branch that I work for.I have trouble applying to places, because I usually don't know what to look for.

However, it doesn't last or we end up ignoring me. I would love you to make it change. As you can see I'm quite old, I'm 50, and I would love to have some dirty fun. I am also very open minded... My advantage with that age is that I am a lot experienced in many fields of these kinky things. And I would love to share this knowledge or just talk very dirty to any woman or girl looking for love, or sweet \"fun\" time. I am married, and I love cheating. Yes my wife doesn't know I'm cheating on her back.. But in the other hand, I really need another body to fill, to have fun with, to pleasure. My cock is also quite huge, and old.. So I'm looking for any roleplay or any chat. You must know that I'm very dominant, and won't hesitate to be rough and mean, to add few words that add a different turning to the chat, and make it more unique. I can also be very nice and kind. I'm just open to anything, as long as we have both fun. You love older men? Message me! You want to know how I would make you a lovely girl, like a good whore? Message me! Don't be afraid, it's not because I'm old that I'm bad. My kinks : dom, cheating, Dd\/lg(Young girls are definitly a big plus) ,girls who just want to be body degraded and ruined, girls wearing slutty clothes, rough sex. I have many more to list!

I get a lot of PMs asking if being if being inexperienced\/a virgin\/etc is going to be a problem so I'll answer in advance: if you're open-minded and wilfully and extremely submissive, I think we'll be fine.\n\nFeel free to PM even if you're over 25 but in this case attaching a picture is essential (**I'll happily extend you the curtesy of replying to** **all PMs with a picture link regardless of my intention**). Physically, my sub should be:\n\n* any of: skinny\/slim\/slender\/toned\/athletic body types. I don't typically go for larger guys on either end of the spectrum, either extra pounds or extra muscle. Neither is really my style.\n* clean shaven or close shaven face (not a beard queen, sorry!)\n* any height\n* with a general respect for their outward appearance\n\nAs for me, I'm 5'7\", brunette, petite, slim body type, and as for the dynamic I need a slave who is focused on working for their Domme's satisfaction, is hopelessly submissive, obedient, and uncomplaining (within set limits). Someone who loves to be used for pleasure. Ideally I'm looking for a long-term arrangement, one-time play is usually a no, but feel free to try your luck.\n\nKink-wise, I love task-setting and general control play to exert my control over my sub. I love all kinds of orgasm control and JOI, including edging and ruined orgasm. CEI is another favourite, as is tight underwear\/tight-fitting clothing, as well as uniforms (on my sub). I also like light CBT (hitting\/slapping, pegs). **That is an abridged list**.\n\nConsidering that I love voyeurism as well as the general control play, I need subs who are perfectly comfortable in front of the camera. Anything you send me will remain completely private (unless sharing is something you're into).\n\nI'm also into aspect and notions of total\/broader control in other aspects of your life, if you appreciate guidance or outright domination outside the strictly sexual play, we can talk about it. I especially like dressing and grooming, scheduling, exercise plans, etc. Happy to talk more.\n\nI can be flexible about my style of domination and I'm happy to talk to you about it. Naturally, I'm strict but caring, selfish and fairly uncompromising. But if you need a firmer hand, I like that just as much. Having said that, **I am NOT interested in a bratty sub**. I need obedience.\n\n**A single-line PM is a great way not to hear from me**, but as I said before if you include a picture I'll extend you the curtesy of responding regardless of my intentions.\n\nVerification will be the very first thing we do. No findom.\n\nP.S. For the Australians, I'm in Melbourne. I'm happy to talk about something IRL but only after a period of having something successful online.

We dated for 9 months and I decided to move out from my mothers house to my boyfriends apartment. I realized I had left some of my important document papers at her house and my boyfriend insisted on getting them for me, I was uneasy at first but I gave in.

He frequently (as in multiple times a week) will sit down and drink 1\/2 - 3\/4 of a fifth of alcohol or an entire 6 pack of beer in a night. It's also not unheard of for him to drink more. He also often does not realize how much he's drunk until it's the end of the night or he runs out of what he has in the house. He also tends to think he can hold his liquor better than he actually does and never realizes how drunk he actually is. (Stereotypical macho guy thing of I can drink so much and it doesn't really affect me)\n\nWe have had many conversations about this over the years. He has promised many times to quit or cut back, but eventually something happens. He'll have an exceptionally shitty day\/ week at work or something really awesome happens and he wants to celebrate. He will always talk to me about it before as usually it violates some rule we've agreed on (like no drinking on work days). He'll say it's a one time exception, but then it turns into two and then he's back to his old ways. This has happened many times.\n\nThe current problem: I am 38 weeks pregnant as of a few weeks ago my husband agreed to keep his drinking to under the legal limit (2 legal drinks in an hour). This is for two reasons 1) when I go into labor he needs to be able to drive me to the hospital, 2) When the baby gets here he needs to remain sober while taking care of her.  \n\nHe is mad now because I am leery of trusting his word on controlling his drinking. He sees me watching and gets upset. It recently turned into a big fight where he ended up asking me if I trusted him or not. I told him no, that as much as I wanted to, his past behavior has shown me that I can't.

But, I mean I can totally do this!\n\nSo, I stripped butt naked and took off into the night. I just had to do a little naked run and it would all be over. I'd finally prove that I could do this, that I wasn't just some shy girl who never had fun. I can have fun! I mean, right now I'm terrified and my heart is threatening to burst but I can have fun!

It sounds like someone running...barefoot. You decide to investigate, having nothing better to do.\n\nThen, from across the park you noticed a pale figure emerge from the bushes, running... nude.

I'm 21, and I'm actually a bit of a nudist in real life! I'm 5'11\" with long dark hair that goes down to just above my butt, and brown eyes. I have decent boobs and a thin frame, with long, soft legs. I like to talk things out a bit before we begin, so please don't just jump into it! I'm pretty vulnerable in this situation, and I need to make sure we're on the same page. Overall I'd love to focus on the being caught nude angle more than actual sex. More of a teasing me for being nude in public than having your way with me right away.\n\nKinks: Exhibitionism, with ENF and CFNF in particular, is the big kink for the night but there is also room for D\/s, spankings, handcuffs, nipple clamps, teasing, light humiliation, and maybe even romance.\n\nLimits: beast, gore, blood, scat, non-con, bathroom stuff, kids, and death, and I won't respond to anyone who asks me to use kik or discord.

He died shortly after this, then my parents, financial losses ending in ruin. I was left entirely alone. My business folded, I suffered illness. Somehow I soldiered on. I guess I clung to Faith.\nYears later I remarried. Same program. I lost two children, finally delivered a baby boy. Good times ahead we thought. No. Child diagnosed with autism at 15 months. Husband diagnosed with dementia at the same time. Husband died. Son is severely autistic and doubly incontinent, seizures, nonverbal.\nI soldiered on. I am caring for my son now myself as his anxieties prevent anyone else coming on the scene. I am 65. He is 18. The misfortune continues. I won't go into more detail as you get the picture.\nI have been to priests before. They bless me and tell me to throw myself on God:s Mercy and I have. They acknowledge it was a spell.

I'm 23 years old, a female, 5'1\", I don't really know my weight because I don't weigh myself because I have an eating disorder but I can say that I'm probably on the higher side of 180 and I am very compact and muscular vs fat. I'm Caucasian.\n\nMy complaint started kind of a while ago. Back when I was 17 I'd witnessed my father's death and punched a wall out of anger with my left hand. Years later the hand I used to punch a wall tends to get really painful and cracks and clicks, especially after a session of weight training at the gym (which I do often). Usually I have to have my wrist in some type of wrap or something. When typing the pain goes up into my hand. More on the pinky\/ring finger side. It also will hurt to bend my wrist or carry anything or anything like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has only been something that happened since I punched the wall and I never have seen a doctor about it because I thought it was no big deal at first since I only did minimal weight training but since I started doing a lot more weight training the problem comes up more and more. I'm wondering is it possible I broke or fractured a bone in my wrist years ago and never knew it? Or is there another reason why this wrist has a bunch of problems now? Like I get punching the wall probably caused some type of problem, but if it did, what could it have done and how can I fix it or at least make it bearable?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am on psychiatrist medication (Seroquel 400mg, Zoloft 150mg, Trazodone 100mg, Klonopin 1.5mg) and antibiotics for acne (minocyline 100mg twice a day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for any help.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskDocs","subreddit_id":"t5_2xtuc","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AskDocs","subreddit_subscribers":136577,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Could I have fractured my wrist years ago and not known it?","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskDocs\/comments\/bvff88\/could_i_have_fractured_my_wrist_years_ago_and_not\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

With no money i started e commerce biz selling fake Huff Socks and within a month after finding out my new reality (no money, all assets were seized) , this was my first experience hitting rock bottom.  I moved to LA with 84$ in my pocket after my ebay account was flagged by the actual company, I then purchased  my plane ticket to pursue a career in acting. Even though i never took the craft as seriously as i should i grew up studying theatre in middle\/highschool and i was set that it was my dream after my best friends moved in his early teens and started having relatively good success; i thought if he could do it so could i. I lived there for 5 years, got an agent no too long after landing due to my connections and started going out on auditions promptly.  I slept on my best friends couch for 4 years. The concept of self sufficiency was new to me and my first few years there i was struggling just to stay afloat let alone invest in myself and go to class, even though i had inexpensive rent crashing on the couch. After a few years and little success i grew tired of my situation turned a small weed habit into daily smoking to partying and experimenting with psychedelics. I got lucky enough one day and met my future boss at a party, i was promptly hired as a delivery driver for a his weed delivery service ( i drove for Uber Eats and Postmates at the time) and was finally luckily enough to be given a starting salary of 36k,(i know, its not much of a good salary for LA) a multi-million dollar home to lease on the cheap from one of the investors (i had roommates). i finally felt like i had accomplished something in my life. I was set on getting the company out of debt and making it into one of the biggest weed delivery services in LA once my boss left LA to cut costs due to his own personal debt\/company debt. He essentially handed me the keys to running the company. As a 22 year old with no experience in business i unconsciously drove the company into the ground, i partied with my rich friends at every nightclub you can imagine, went on small vacation trips, started to be late on costumer orders, financially i was living way above my means and it all came crashing down once my boss found out half our inventory was gone (due to my daily smoking habit) and the delivery car engine had blown due to no oil change. Costumer complaints were the cherry on top of my dismissal. (Yeah, i know your probably thinking I'm an idiot, I've made some stupid mistakes in my life looking back) Luckily we got to keep leasing the house but i was forced to leave the company, leaving me in financially tight spot. I got lucky booked a gig as as stand in for a few months, and made another stupid decision of financing a 19k car which i ended up crashing in the rain. Another mistake. Insurance paid out 15k and now i only owe 4k but surprise, i shot myself in the foot yet again after i was forced to move out the house we had on lease due to me violating the lease agreement. (I posted my room on airbnb to supplement my income and i slept on the couch) With no one to stay with, i was forced to move back home; where my grandparents left us their house after passing away. I never thought about what i would do if i wasn't pursuing a career being an actor, but i do i didn't put in the work needed to be successful at it like i should have. Thats the truth. My older brother who works in finance suggests i go to college, i do however have a passion for real estate. Ideally my end goal is to be real estate investor  flip houses\/ own apartments etc. and I'm inspired by the financial freedom it brings. Just wanted to get some suggestions on what are some of the best paths you guys think it would take to get there.

I was always a morning person and once I was awake, I was up and ready to go. This come on kind of quick and I assumed it was pre-menopause symptoms. Next was odd back pain, abdominal paid under my ribs, kidney area pain and horrible heartburn that no OTC would get rid of.  Fatigue like I had never felt before. I was someone who got home from work and did not sit down until 9 or 10 pm. I constantly kept busy so this was a dramatic change for me. I\u2019ve had arrhythmia since I was a teen but during this time, the palpitations grew worse and also come on fast. Several trips to the ER and I was told I needed to increase my heart medicine. Over a year went by of not being listened to by doctors I decided I must be crazy and imagining my symptoms so I tried to ignore them. A few weeks later I started running fever, chills and by the next afternoon I could not stand up straight and my joints and muscles ached so bad it felt like I had been beat up. I knew it wasn\u2019t a normal sickness and had something to do with whatever was going on so I had my husband drive me to urgent care. Again, nothing was found. No flu and normal results.  I cried on my way home because I felt like no one was believing me. \nAfter a lot of research I decided to ask my doctor to test me for Lyme disease. They actually agreed and even though several markers tested positive, it wasn\u2019t enough for a positive Lyme diagnosis. They also agreed to do an MRI and saw that my liver was enlarged. They started to listen to me at that point and did extra blood test. My blood test come back with my levels off and I was sent to a hematologist. They did more test and my liver had gone back to normal size but they found I had hemochromatosis but only the homozygous type so I shouldn\u2019t be symptomatic. They dismissed me until I basically begged them not to. I was then referred to a rheumatologist. She did more blood test and there were several markers off but nothing was extreme except for the test that shows inflammation and I tested positive for PR3 C-ANCA. My level was 4.1 and was told that I needed to be tested for GPA. In order to be diagnosed, I would have to be seen by an ENT. The ENT gave me antibiotics and Flonase because my sinuses were inflamed but nothing else that qualified a GPA diagnosis. My rheumatologist advised me that the clinic had reached their limit on what they could test for and she referred me to a University for help. She stated that I had an autoimmune disease but I would have to see a specialized group for proper diagnoses. I made an appointment and the wait list for new patients was 6 months. During that time I developed additional symptoms. \nI finally got in and they ordered a ton of blood work. Again, I tested positive for PR3 C-ANCA but it was now only 2.6 H, white blood count was still low, low vitamin D. Same as my last 4 blood test. I really thought this is it, they are going to find out what is wrong with me and fix me.\nI missed a call from my doctor today but they left a message explaining that even though my test were not normal, they did not feel they were low enough to be diagnosed with GPA or an autoimmune disease so they were not going to treat me for one. However due to the levels I would need to be monitored closely by my PCP. So basically after over 2 years and many many tests, I am back at knowing nothing and feeling like shit 24\/7. These are the doctors who are supposed to find what no other doctors can and they are dismissing me. I cried and am going between giving up and being angry.\n\nMy symptoms:\nFatigue, headaches, low grade fevers most days, chills, stomach pain, nausea, pain in left kidney area and under ribs, major brain fog, forgetfulness, forgetting basic words, dry eyes and mouth, sinus issues, weight loss, tiny red dots on my skin, ridges in nails, horrible heartburn that returns as soon as I am out of prescription Prilosec.  If I sit for longer than 10 minutes I can\u2019t stand straight up right away because I am stiff like I have cement in my body and my muscles ache. I am 40 but I move like I am 80. My hands and feet will go numb and tingle for short periods of time. The newest symptoms are the most concerning which are seeing odd flashes of light or colors for a split second, bruises all over my legs for no reason and a purple-reddish blood\/bruise type webbing or splotches all over my legs that is now moving to my arms. The doctors seen this in the office. \n\nI need someone to listen to me. I am NOT crazy and I know that it is not normal for someone with my energy levels to go from what I was to what I am in a matter of a few months for no reason. I feel like with the way that my symptoms are progressing, something major is going to happen that will be irreversible and no one is helping me.

My new ob said I could get clomid but will not prescribe it until my a1c is lower (it was 5.9).

The only other health issue I have is recurring kidney stones, I've passed a few small calcium oxalate kidney stones (confirmed by urine sample as well as CT scan, I can give more lab results of urine test if necessary) I drink an above average amount of water, I don't consume much dairy nor do I take any kind of calcium supplement, I also don't eat a lot of high oxalate foods except for maybe chocolate haha (but not excessively) Anyway my doctor just shrugs it off and tells me to drink more water. So although this info isn't related to my current issue, I just wanted to be thorough with my other \"health issues\"\n\nMy current issue I've been having is what I assume to be (but obviously could be way off base) very fast digestion\/bowel issues. For example I just ate a grapefruit less than an hour ago and tacos half an hour ago, and now I'm stuck on the toilet with diarrhea and I noticed little undigested bits of grapefruit in my stool. This happens to me on a semi regular basis (2-3\u00d7 a week, sometimes more and sometimes less) depending on what I eat, and Ive had this issue for a couple years but didn't pay much attention to it at first. It's usually causes by restaurant foods like olive garden and  buffalo wild wings, but can also happen with random \"healthy\" foods such as a homemade smoothie with fruits and veggies.\n\nTests\/family history: my brother has eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and many minor food allergies associated with the disease (gluten, kiwi, nuts, almost everything) but he does not restrict his diet at all and he eats whatever he wants. A major complication from his EoE is choking, and he tore his esophagus.\n\nIm posting the results from my CT scan from when I was seen for kidney stones about 2 months ago, this was not for my diarrhea\/digestion issues\n\nCT results- (no contrast, the CT results note that because there is no contrast organ evaluation is limited)  IMPRESSION: (these aren't the full results just the impression)\n\n1. Punctate nonobstructing right intrarenal calculus.\n\n2. Nonspecific mild central mesenteric lymphadenopathy. This is usually \nsequela from prior enteritis or adenitis.\n\nI've also done 23andme genetic testing and I have an increased risk of celiac disease due to having 2 copies of the HLA-DQ8 gene, but this obviously isn't diagnostic\n\nAnyway are my symptoms within normal limits, am I just being dramatic? I hate going to the doctor because I tend to doubt myself because I don't want to feel like a hypochondriac.\n\nIf you have any other questions regarding my health history, please ask me.

I feel like such a failure I'm 20 years old I'm supposed to be a sophomore in college getting ready to enter into my junior year but I'm pretty sure I'm still a freshman I was doing ok when I first started college but then I started doing horribly. I decided to take 2 classes to ease my stress last year but I did horrible I almost failed one of my classes that I was taking for the 3rd time and I stopped going to my second class completely so I got a W and I was taking that class for the second time because I failed the first time. So now I'm on academic probation and I am thinking about dropping out so I don't have to tell my mom that I failed out. I took a break from school this year and I was gonna go back in the fall but my mom isn't paying for school anymore and I don't blame her for not paying. She told me this when I did bad in those two classes and I don't have the money to pay for school also I am just going to do bad again even if my mom said she would pay for my classes but my mom wants me to stay in school and at least get my associate's degree but I have zero motivation and I can never get myself out of bed to go to school. I have a job and the only reason I still have it is because I work hard to keep it so I can at least buy my own things so I'm not a complete burden on my mom and because my mom told me she was disappointed in me because at the time I wasn't working and I was doing bad in school. My mom hasn't told me I had to leave but she has said that she thought I would be at some college far away and that she wants to move in with her girlfriend but she can't because then I would have no where to go. She pays alot in rent for a small apartment that we share I don't have a bed at the moment longstory and we can't afford to buy one. I just think I should leave but I have no where to go so the only other option is to kill myself that way I don't stress my mom out and I don't have to deal with being a fat, ugly, piece of shit anymore. I had gained over 40 lbs in like a year and a half ever since I graduated high school in 2017. I can't fit alot of my clothes that I used to be able to wear I hated my body before because I was fat but now I'm even fatter. I tried to starve myself but I always break and eat something. And I've always been ugly cause no guys ever talk to me I've never had a boyfriend and I have never been kissed. Also I basically have no friends.

This really only started bugging me as of this year - the idea sort of popped into my head like \"was that fucked up?\". \n\nTL;DR: Unlicensed 8th grade therapist (me) wonders if it fucked him up\n \nThe worst part is I don't really remember that period of my life well enough to give specifics. I know we would talk about her self-harming often, and she would tell me she was harming herself while we were texting or on the phone. She would tell me about wanting to kill herself and I would try to talk her down. Lately I've been thinking this was a lot to deal with as a 13 or 14 year old.\n\nPeople would also tease me about her, as you would expect from eighth-graders. They didn't know what I did, obviously, but I was the guy dating the \"emo girl,\" and I caught some grief for it. It felt embarrassing, and I felt taken of advantage of to a degree.\n\nEven talking about it feels a bit embarrassing, like I'm making a bigger deal out of it than it really is. \"It was 8th grade, how could it have been that serious?\" and the like.\n\nRecently it's been bothering me that I've never been in any real relationship since then, if you could even call a couple of 13 year olds making out \"real.\" I haven't even held hands with a girl since then. It was when that was bothering me that this whole thing bubbled up. I wonder if this incident left me with some sort of vulnerability problem that I was never aware of? The abstract idea of a relationship is something I definitely want, but when I try to picture something or someone specific it's uncomfortable and a bit frightening. I've always thought I just didn't have an interest in a relationship but I'm starting to wonder if that's not actually true and I've just been scared this whole time.\n\n\nWhile I'm at it, I've also realized I have a big crush on one of my closest female friends. The whole situation I described in the post has a nice bonus of me having no experience, which in and of itself makes me even more nervous, which makes me even more nervous about trying to do anything about the aforementioned crush. Hormones are fun\n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far - sorry the post is composed so poorly I just kinda went stream-of-consciousness on it. Feels good to have said all of that, though I don't think it helped me make any better sense of it.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"offmychest","subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/offmychest","subreddit_subscribers":1620048,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"In 8th grade, my girlfriend told me she'd kill herself if I broke up with her","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/offmychest\/comments\/bvfx2d\/in_8th_grade_my_girlfriend_told_me_shed_kill\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

We're all trying to work on it but obviously we weren't expecting this situation at all. My brother in law and I are the only two working (and he's working in Oklahoma) but together we make a fair bit of money so affording rent is not an issue at all.

But I can sleep for fairly long now as I'm going to college so no sleep problems until now.\n\n2 days ago I went to sleep at 2 am, nothing weird. Then I woke up at 4:45 to my dad coughing like hell and walking around (he became ill). I instantly had an axiety attack and I couldn't sleep anymore at all, no matter what I tried.\n\nA little back story: probably I have a slight PTSD-anxiety thingy as some months ago I woke up to my dad puking and almost literally dying (I had to call ambulance) so back then I only slept like 3 hours while worrying about him.\n\nI managed to sleep easily at the afternoon yesterday for 2 hours, no anxiety. Then now... this is ridiculous. I went to bed at 1 am and almost fell asleep, but my dad came out about 35-40 mins later and it triggered the anxiety again. Then my anxiety went away, but weird sounds from the street woke me up again before falling asleep. I started doing other things, like watching funny youtube videos which always works and then I can go to sleep usually. At about 3 am I started worrying my dad will wake up again, and wake me up at like 4 am and since then I can't sleep.\n\nNo matter how much I tell myself that won't happen or so what, I have so strong anxiety now that I'm shaking. I got up on PC because the anxiety is killing me and I feel like it's doing more damage than me not be able to sleep.\n\nMy head hurts, I feel awful but not sleepy at all, even tho yesterday I only slept 3 hours + 2 hours in the afternoon.\n\nI'm still shaking, it's 4:30 ofc my dad didn't wake up or cough so my anxiety is completely pointless but I still can't stop it which never happened before. :(\n\nPs: sorry for weird sentences etc, but I haven't slept at all and having some problems so forgive me lol","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"insomnia","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3g","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/insomnia","subreddit_subscribers":31262,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Anxiety cycle keeps me up all night, need help, worried about my health","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/insomnia\/comments\/bvg3be\/anxiety_cycle_keeps_me_up_all_night_need_help\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

Sorry!\n\nSo my mom is 51 and I'm 21. She for as long as I can remember has loved caring for animals and I love that doing that too. But my father is the only breadwinner of the family and what my mom does is she spends too much, way too much on animals. There's always some unnecessary costs which can easily be curtailed. When we try telling her that, she just goes *book* \"no one understands me\" \"I understand the pain of animals because I'm unlovable\" \"I do so much for you guys, you guys only point out the mistakes in me\". And we love her, but we only tell her to spend within limits which she doesn't do. \n\nAlso, she tries to control us. I live in uni but rn I'm at home from a break. She won't let us touch the fridge because \"we are unclean\" idk whatever she means by that. So when I'm hungry I have to ask her to get the food out of the fridge and she says \"no, you eat at specific times\" and this habit of hers has fed my eating disorder. \n\nShe also tries to make everything about her. I hate it when someone posts pictures of me. I clearly had told my mom not to post a video of me and she had posted that. Yesterday I told her I don't trust you, and she told me \"please stop finding out all the flaws in me. I know I'll never be enough for you\" and etc even when I tried explaining her I have bed and an Ed. \n\nAlso, I always have to tiptoe around her to get her feelings hurt. Whenever I say something, it's like playing a game of Russian roulette.\n\nSorry for the extra long post and also any grammatical errors, English is not my first language.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"narcissisticparents","subreddit_id":"t5_3h0qh","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/narcissisticparents","subreddit_subscribers":6213,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Mom always plays the victim","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/narcissisticparents\/comments\/bvg6ea\/mom_always_plays_the_victim\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}
