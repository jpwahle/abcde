I'm 23, and of course all celebrities will be 18+. I'm looking for a partner to do a somewhat unique roleplay between myself, an up-and-coming photographer, and you, playing as one of my favorite celebrities. The catch is, this isn't any normal photoshoot. We can do this one of two ways, both involving some kind of mind control:\n\nThe first idea would be simple. All photographers have to use some kind of flash to get the right lighting, and I just so happen to have one that makes these shoots a little more fun. Each flash makes you stray further and further from your normal behavior, until you're practically begging to be used by me. Or, as an alternative, each flash puts you deeper into a trance, allowing me to mold you into the perfect slut myself. \n\nThe second idea is a bit less straightforward. Any good, fancy photoshoot requires makeup. As a good business owner, I always ensure that my clients have everything they need right in the studio. It just so happens that all of the makeup I own changes how you behave. Each piece does something different.

I don't think I'm trans (though having a dick would be tight as hell - I don't get along well with my vagina), as male categorization also doesn't sit right either, so I am suspecting my gender identity might belong somewhere in this enby space.\n\nAll that being said, I am not sure what ~identifying as nonbinary~ would do for me and my life, or even how to go about it really. Socially speaking, asking people to call me different things sounds scary, and I really don't know if it would make me feel better or more at home with myself.\n\nAdditionally, I don't even know if I hate being a woman (referring to myself as such makes me wanna puke), or just hate all the societal constructs that being a woman entails...\n\nFinally, the main point of conflict and discomfort (maybe dysphoria?) comes about from the first two words of my title - I am well-endowed, and my tits very much happen to be my main erroneous zone. Boobs are something I am very interested in on other people - I love titties. But I have really complicated feelings about my own - I wish they were smaller and more compact and tight, and less of a dominant feature on my body. Short of losing lots of weight (I am 5'6, 150lbs, 36DD, so if I lost 30lbs I could conceivably go down a few cup sizes), I don't really know how to address this. How has losing weight to ease dysphoria (or maybe dysmorphia) worked for people? Has anyone gone through a breast reduction surgery but kept some breast tissue? Do you keep the same nipple sensitivity?\n\nThank you so much everyone for your help - I appreciate all the participants on this sub.

I have BPD, bipolar 2, PTSD, anxiety, and ADHD; I'm not an easy person to be with. When I first met her I fell head over heels in love with her, and the fact that she didn't care that I was mentally ill was honestly the best feeling ever. We dated throughout high school on and off and when I graduated I got really depressed not seeing her every day... My depression got super bad that I was short and very needy with her; I guess she couldn't handle this anymore and broke up with me by saying \"I don't love you anymore\" having a fp say this to me killed me inside and I have nightmares about those words to this day. Shortly after she broke up with me I tried to commit suicide but was saved by paramedics. We kept in contact for a while and it was super hard... She would text me \"I love you\" one day then text \"lets just be friends\" the next and this went on for a year until she got a new boyfriend.. This absolutely killed me... I started cutting again (I'm 3 months clean) and just spiraled out of control. It wasn't until she found out I was transgender that she stopped texting me and blocked me from her accounts... I tried texting her a year ago and she was super short with me and then I guess blocked me from texting her... She always said she would love me no matter what and that I can always talk to her when I was in a bad place, but how am I supposed to do that now that I'm blocked out of her life and she hates me now... Her and her boyfriend broke up (I think) \\[I know it's bad, but I used\/use other accounts\/ incognito mode to still see her posts...\\] And I see she posts things saying she loves him and misses him like she used to do me and It fucking hurts like hell... I've tried not looking at her accounts but It's too hard to just ignore... I just love her so much... idk.. maybe I'm just fucking crazy... She was my everything and I still dream about her and there isn't a day that doesn't go by without me thinking about her, her mannerisms, her smile, her laugh, everything reminds me of her...

I will be moving into university residence in September and I am obviously going to live with my parents for the remainder of the summer.\n\nI got kicked out tonight. Initially we were discussing how to go about a boating trip with a friend of mine as new lockdown restrictions have been placed on my area stopping people from meeting indoors if they are from different families. I work with the guy in question so we are in a bubble anyway and the discussion was more about them making sure we were going to be sensible whilst we we're away and not agitate the locals. I did not see an issue in this at all, in fact we would have 0 contact with anyone other then ourselves and it was just going to be a short 2 day trip. Therefore I was getting fairly agitated when they continuously went over the same point over and over again and I may have been short with them. \n\nI went about my evening as if nothing had happened until I went back down to pack for the trip. I walked over some stuff on the staircase that I had assumed had been moved up from the basement for the weekend and my mum snapped at me. Literally shouted at me saying why would I walk past something on the staircase and not take it down with me and started berating me about it. If this sounds ridiculous to you I can assure you it did to me as well and I told her not to speak to me like that, I said I just assumed it was there for the weekend and there was no need to get angry with me rather just ask me to move it. Bare in mind I am an adult now, I have no choice but to live with them at the minute and we have been existing in a mutually respectful and, to be honest, nice environment for the last 3 months.\n\nWell all shit broke loose, I won't bore you with the argument because it's the usual shouting match with 0 progress made neither of us backing down she began swearing and I called her a hypocrite because I would get slaughtered if I ever swore at her. They she told me to get out of the house, gave me no time, said to leave immediately. Bare in mind I was wearing shorts and a t shirt and it's 10pm, I can't stay anywhere because of the Coronavirus and had nothing with me. I told her not to be ridiculous and put some more clothes on before leaving. I don't know whether she expects me to sleep on a fucking park bench or what. Where can I go? This just seems like the most insane over reaction to me being a little frustrated after a hot day's work and getting lectured in the kitchen.\n\nAm I going insane or is this just fucking ridiculous? And what should I even begin to say to my parents?\n\nI should add I think this also has a lot to do with my best friends parents, who I am very friendly with. They have been pretty bad parents as she was growing up but I get along well with them as friends. My mum has made loads of comments about how I should \"just go live with them\" or \"you change when you come back from theirs do you like it better,\" the truth is. They are friends, my parents are my parents. I would not want to have them as parents. I have told my mum this so many times now it's getting out of hand. I suggested she was jealous of the fact I share more about my life with them and that was only because they made it clear that they were my parents not my friends. They can't just flip a switch at 18 and expect me to be fully transparent. It will take me years to make that transition.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjdm","subreddit_subscribers":546371,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I got kicked out tonight and I'm honestly just shocked and I don't know what to say to my parents.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/i1iwqn\/i_got_kicked_out_tonight_and_im_honestly_just\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I'm a linger-er in the group normally (though I made this throw away account for this post) but need some advice. I started my financial revolution about a year or two ago. I'm 33 and I've had zero education on personal finance. My role at work slowly started to take on departmental budget responsibilities so I started finally studying things like economics and finance. That's when I realized how much trouble I'm in.\n\nSince then, I've cleaned out my 12K in credit card debt and I've started building up my emergency savings. In the flow chart, I'm at \"Increase Emergency Funds to 3-6 month living expenses\". We just sold our house (and are actively looking for a new one) and my only other debt is my vehicle and my student loans. My wife just has her vehicle.\n\nFor investments: With my current employer I've about $9400 in my 401k. From my previous employer (a government position) I've got about $2K in a \"457 Deferred Compensation Plan\" and $750 in a \"Profit Sharing Plan\". It's been suggested to me that I roll my former companies investments either into my 401k or an IRA, but I'm not sure which plan is best? If IRA - Which one? And after that, how do I go about this? My wife's family has been going to Edward Jones for years in our small community and loves their agent and always pushes me towards him, however I read a lot of poor reviews of them on here.\n\nI'm not just looking for answers, I'm trying to understand this. I spend more time than I care to admit reading up on all of this and still don't have a grip on it. I'm assuming that's because I haven't just got my hands on it. If willing, please over explain your reasoning. I thirst for knowledge!

I am a college student from around the Raleigh area, who is looking for a relationship with a woman who likes to be lovingly dominate. I\u2019m not really looking for someone who is just into the sex, but I would be lying if I said that couldn\u2019t be a thing with me if you aren\u2019t interested that much but we get a connection. However, the quarantine and lockdown in the US and how it affected me is reaaaally weighing on me.   \n\nI\u2019m looking for a real relationship first, and the FemDom dynamic second. That doesn\u2019t mean the SFW FemDom dynamics can\u2019t bleed into our everyday activities\/life. And this isn\u2019t me looking for a sugar mommy dynamic either. I\u2019m not looking to exactly be treated like being completely owned by a Domme, but to have a mutual attraction that makes me want to be completely subservient to you because you\u2019re nice, caring, and loving.   \n\nI suck at describing myself, but I know it\u2019s important so I\u2019ll do my best. I am 23 years old and I\u2019m an engineering student at *that* college that\u2019s known for it here in Raleigh. I\u2019m white, with brown, medium-length hair, a little bit of facial hair right now, and deep blue eyes. Some friends have said my eyes remind them of looking out to the ocean. Im a fairly hairy person, but I\u2019m not near werewolf level of hairy. I\u2019m 6\u20190\u201d tall and I am overweight. I have been working on it, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s hard to really get a grip for me, however I\u2019m trying and starting to get somewhere.   \n\nI have a lot of interests so I\u2019ll try to keep this as short as I can. I enjoy the basic stuff almost any guy my age likes: video games, some anime, Netflix, books, and movies but to be more specific I love Thriller, Sci-Fi, and Fantasy stuff. I really liked the Witcher, both the series and the video game (3). I need to read the books soon. I\u2019m a big Harry Potter fan (once you know my name you\u2019ll know). I\u2019m trying to get to reading ASoIaF books, but the ending of the show messed me up on that.  \n\nSo to move on from media, I\u2019m a very big fan of cars and machinery. I love moving parts, loud engines, and burning fuel. Driving is one of the best parts of my day sometimes and I feel like I could drive for hours. I\u2019d love to go for a late night drive and listen to some relaxing tunes as we just cruise. I try and find car meets and stuff to get social about it (in normal situations).   \n\nAs for sports and physical activities, I love to swim and play ultimate with friends. I like to watch football and baseball but only really as outings and only for certain teams, I don\u2019t pay much attention to players. I enjoy a nice bike ride every once in a while.   \n\nI also love cooking. I\u2019ve been learning in lockdown and I think I got some kickers for sure, if you\u2019d like to try.   \n\nThere isn\u2019t much that I\u2019m picky of in the person I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019m not going to push any preferences or push people away by saying I\u2019m only attracted to X. I\u2019d like to find someone, who is bi (like me but I\u2019m only bi for feminine people) and into being gentle and lovingly dominate. I\u2019d hope that you\u2019d have some of the same interests or at least are interested in learning about them as I would be for you.   \n\nI really just want to take this slowly at first. I\u2019d like for us to talk and get to know each other, then see where things take us from there. I do want to refrain from anything in person for now, because of the state of the country.   \n\nSo, I guess that\u2019s all I\u2019m really asking\/looking for. If you\u2019re interested, please feel free to send me a message or chat. I also have my usernames for the popular messaging apps in my profile if you\u2019re interested. I hope we can get to talking soon.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtyr4r","subreddit_id":"t5_2vqun","subreddit_subscribers":541715,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"23 [M4F] [Raleigh, NC]: Looking for a connection with a loving Gentle Domme.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtyr4r\/comments\/i1ja8r\/23_m4f_raleigh_nc_looking_for_a_connection_with_a\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

The kids were very happy to see their grandparents because they started skipping and gave bigs hugs when they reached them.\n\nNow, my husband is kid crazy. Clucky to the max. Would have mountains of children as soon as possible if he could. He's looking at them all gooey eyed and I can just feel his man ovaries are about to explode. I stay silent as he continues to eat his food with a stupid grin on his face. \nThat's when I decide to shatter his high.\n\nMe: Would you leave me if I don't change my mind about kids?\n\nHusband: No, I'll just knock you up.\n\nMe: Umm, no you fucking won't. I'm being serious. I'm 32. If I haven't changed my mind by now, I'm not going to.\n\nH: Why? Why don't you want kids?\n\nMe: As I've told you multiple times before. Because I don't. I don't want to give birth. I don't want to be a mum. I don't want to raise children. I don't like them.\n\nH: Well, I'll knock you up. Then I'll raise the kid.\n\nMe: what part of I don't want to give birth do you not understand.\n\nH: we'll adopt.\n\nMe: Ok, it's obvious that any reason I give you or excuse, as you call them, is never going to be valid in your eyes. I am NOT having children.\n\nH: Why can't you just have them. We'd make such adorable babies.\n\nMe: Yes, as adorable as they can be when they grow into kids and teenagers that inherate ADHD and severe depression, as well as diabetes and heart disease.\n\nH: You need to stop thinking like that\n\nMe: like what? A realist? \n\nH: Well, just pop one out, I'll raise it, and you can go and do whatever it is you want.\n\nMe: Are you serious? You want kids that bad? \n\nHe didn't answer after that. Then we went and played the pokies for a while. He lost $100, I won't $50. A small karma win for me.\n\nIt's really pissed me off that my husband, the man who's supposed to support me no matter what, just dismisses me like I'm nothing when it comes to kids. He's either in extreme denial or he truly believes I will change my mind.\n\nOver the last year, I had weight-loss surgery and have lost 40kgs. I was so fucking close to having diabetes, which runs in my family, and possible heart problems. I also had severe depression which was mainly caused by my body dysmorphia. I felt like I was a fit and healthy person, but when I looked in the mirror, I saw this disgusting, morbidly obese pig. Basically, if this surgery didn't work, I would have killed myself. So it was pretty bad.\n\nNow, my outside matches who I am on the inside and I am so happy with life. \n\nExcept this.\n\nWe haven't had sex in months because he keeps saying that he'll knock me up. \nI got an Implanon put in a few months ago, but I'm still terrified. \n\nI've told him that he has 3 years to decide what he wants, because when the implant comes out, I'm getting my tubes removed. \n\nI'm sorry this is so long and all over the place. I'm just so pissed off and upset.\n\nI know I'm going to have to divorce him, it's just a really shitty and uncertain time in the world right now. Which is apparently just another stupid excuse I have for not wanting kids.\n\nEdit\/update: Thank you all for taking the time to read this, it really means a lot to have people who actually understand where I'm coming from.\n\n\nWhy did I marry him if I knew he wanted kids so bad?:\n\nWhen we started dating and then got married, I was in a really bad place mentally. I was just going through life like I was watching myself from afar, unable to do anything. I had accepted the fact that I would get married, have kids, stay fat and be miserable for the rest of my life. Now that I'm in a much better place, I've realised I don't want that. I've realised that I actually really don't like kids.\n\nI believe he is in extreme denial and is just not willing to accept that the doormat he married no longer exists.\n\nMy husband is actually a good guy for the most part. Just not when it comes to kids, which is really the only issue we have in our relationship. It just sucks there's no middle ground, it just seems to go from 0 to 100 in an instant with no discussion in between. I try to have a real conversation and tell him how I'm feeling.\n\nWhen it comes to any other issue that I have, he is the most supportive and loving man. But when it comes to babies, he turns in to a man\/mombie hybrid.\n\nSomeone mentioned if he realises how much things change after having a baby. I truly believe he doesn't.\nHe just got a new, rather expensive car. After the fortnightly payments, rent and bills, he's very short on cash. But he still manages to find the money to add new shit to the car.\n\nI've mentioned many times that if we had kids, he would have to sell the car because we couldn't afford it. He says \"Nah, we won't. The car can fit baby seats in the back! Can you imagine racing around with kids in the back! It'll be great!\" \n\nWe also like to play Xbox a lot. I mention that he won't be able to play for hours and hours, yelling and screaming at the tv until the early hours of the morning if we have kids. He just says he'll calm down a bit when they arrive.\n\nThis guy literally screams at the tv at 1am, when I'm in bed, with ear plugs in because he \"just can't control himself when he's having fun!\" with the boys online. He 'forgets', apparently. Even though I'm the one who still has to go to work and get up at 5 every morning...\n\nSorry, this turned in to another rant.\n\nThank you again everyone for your comments and support. I will be looking into divorce very soon and talking to family in the event that I need to leave in a rush.\n\nI'm really hoping we can have an adult conversation and he will actually listen to me, but going on previous attempts, it may be a waste of time.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"childfree","subreddit_id":"t5_2qtwb","subreddit_subscribers":1388859,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Pretty sure I'm going to get divorced","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.97,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/childfree\/comments\/i1je07\/pretty_sure_im_going_to_get_divorced\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

All from a false pos drug test when the baby was born a few years ago. I tested negative for drugs the entire time involved and they did not return my children but I am currently fighting it in the supreme court as pro se. I filed a 60b4 motion to vacate a void judgement in the youth court of the state I live in. (MS, which is crappy because all its proceedings are confidential. This motion is the one I am appealing.) I have created a personal statement outlining this and hopefully show casting that this is the reason I got interested in law. Had I not been involved in these type of proceedings I would have never pursued law. I would have never went this route had I not seen the system and how it destroys families. I hired two lawyers who failed me. My husband and I own a heating and air business but after two years gave my children to my mother (who did not raise me) because her husband makes 150000 and lives in Texas. It is not termination of rights and can be modified. They really do not like it confront them with their actions. For instance, no evidence was ever admitted in the case despite  stating so. Judge filed after I brought this to their attention in oral argument. Long story short, I am the rare few folks who really was innocent who got served a crappy card. I am trying to take that card and produce a winning hand. Is it even possible that I will be admitted anywhere? I was denied at the only school I applied to. MC College in MS. Can you reapply after scoring higher on LSAT (Taking it again in August)?\n\nI know it is not a criminal charge but it is enough for folks to doubt you. Thanks for the input.\n\nBackground-\n\nI took the  lsat made 138. I had a medical emergency in May the day before the flex test and rescheduled for June but I was still getting over the medical surgery I had in May. Basically I was 19 weeks pregnant (It was going great and in my favor in terms of CPS). My visit the day before the May test took a turn for the worst and by the end of that night my bp was so high it could not be regulated with medicine and I had to make a devastating decision to terminate the pregnancy because the doctor said it was either mine or the babies life.\n\nAnyways, I took the June test but as you can imagine the 4 weeks following this did not allow me to study like I should have. I was emotionally, physically, and mentally drained. All my practice scores were 158-160. Imagine my surprise when I got a 138 on the actual test!! Especially given I made a 30 on the ACT and testing is my virtue. \n\nAlso,  I'm 31 years old and I am also not a traditional student. I graduated in 2011.  I have mainly been focused on my family and my husbands ac business for the last nine years. Word to wise, never do this. I did not gain much work experience other than being the secretary and tax preparer for the business.\n\nDespite the low score I applied to MC College and was turned down. I did include my story to a very min in my personal statement. I just wonder if this is going to hurt me? I was told Texas Law Schools are still taking applications and since my Mom (finally after a year) is now working with letting me see my kids, I thought I might could get a scholarship and stay there and then come back to MS once I am done. I could have my kids back and my life resume.  I really want to pursue this. How likely is it that the score was a big big factor?  I had my personal statement checked and edited by a language teacher we do business with. She stated it was pretty good. I just dont know think my dream is gone unless I get this resolved in next 4 weeks when I take the LSAT (which it will not).","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"lawschooladmissions","subreddit_id":"t5_2y2gn","subreddit_subscribers":110715,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Civil Action On Character and Fitness Application","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lawschooladmissions\/comments\/i1jhu2\/civil_action_on_character_and_fitness_application\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I too was a nonburper for about 21 years of my life. I bookmarked this page 3 and a half years ago and only just clicked back on. I'm 24 now and I want to say that there. is. hope. \n\nBefore I started experimenting with different atrocious ways to release gasses and ease the awful gurgles and pains that came with not burping, I had not burped more than a few times since birth. It  was the worst thing and it got really bad in college, especially having undiagnosed dietary allergies (celiac), excessive gas and no way to release them, besides going to the bathroom every 30 minutes. It was shitty, to say the least..\n\nThen I found this page, after google WTF was wrong with me and why could everyone else burp without even trying. I read a bunch of posts that described what to do..... and it worked. I BURP NOW. ALL THE TIME. and it's amazing.\n\nLong story short, I basically started putting my fingers down my throat enough to forcibly release some gasses, it wasn't comfortable. I did that for quite a while, until I was able to kinda start just coughing them out if I coughed loud and hard enough. Did that for a while, and then suddenly, the burps started to happen, very randomly. It took multiple months of awful noises and embarrassment for the burps to start sounding like burps instead of demons expunging from hell. But it worked, and now I burp. Every burp is a victory, and each receives cheers from all my friends who were beside me in my struggles for so long. \n\nOverall, don't lose hope. some of us don't have the reflex. But for me, I was able to forcibly teach my body this reflex.\n\nI hope my story helps you find your burps.

Before you rush to any conclusions... no, we have not put labels on our relationships yet. I like both guys for completely different reasons and its tearing me apart inside knowing both of them really like me. I dont want to lead them both on, but I'm afraid to say anything with how dating culture goes.\n\nGuy #1 is 23... much younger than I. However, he is so cute and makes love, not sex. Its phenomenal. But I'm worried that this high passion will turn into high failure. He reminds me of my first relationship that ruined me and created a fear of commitment within myself. But if he is different than my ex (of 9 years) maybe it will turn out differently.\n\nGuy #2 is 29... solid job &amp; on track to being partner. He is a bit boring, but we do have great sex. I can see the white picket fence day dream with him. But I worry, I'm just choosing him for a future happiness when I'm on track to being a very high up at my company.\n\n My personal goals are to adopt a kid when I'm 32, so I dont need a man to complete my ultimate goals. I dont want to have to commit to someone. At the same time Guy #1 makes me believe in love again, but he is too young to know what he wants. And Guy #2 is perfect in every way except the fact that I dont feel like I can be silly around him even tho his goals are the same as mine.\n\nIdk what to do, both guys are great in different ways.

It was the mid 90's at a YMCA swimming class. I was kind of a \"husky\" boy as all the old people would make sure to tell me. Some boy started laughing at my body. Ever since then I've been very aware of my weight. I never snuck food. I probably over ate. I gained more weight. My brothers began to tease me. Class mates would tease me. My father would ask when I was going to go on a diet. In 6th grade I started weight watchers. In 8th grade I hade reached 200 lbs. (I'm 5'5\") The summer after 10th grade I starved myself and got down to 150. I gained it all back by the time I graduated. I dieted on and off for years. In by 2016, I was 285. My chest felt heavy. It was getting hard to tie my shoes. My feet hurt. I decided I really needed to do something so I did. I calorie counted religiously. I hired a personal trainer. I lost over 120 lbs. But, I still hate myself. I hate my body. I hate my loose skin and folds. I still feel too ashamed to go swimming. I like my face. I think I have a handsome face. But I hate my body. I swipe left on guys on tinder even if I find them attractive because I'm sure they will not see the same attraction. Or maybe they will see it in my face but when they see me in person, they will change their minds. It's even affected how I use the bathroom. Since I was a child I haven't been able to use a public bathroom if it's also occupied by others. This didn't go away after i lost the weight. I still go into week long depressions of self loathing and pity. It's pathetic.  Who would ever want to be with someone so mentally unstable and with such low self esteem? It's unattractive. I don't know how to change. Everyone tells me all the right things: \"No body cares!\" \"You look fine!\" \"Be proud of what you've accomplished!\" \"I would kill to look like you! You should appreciate it!\" \"If you think your fat, you must think I'm REALLY fat.\" I just don't know how to stop feeling so shitty.

But my parents and I were talking the other day about their will (they're both a little older, my mom is 67 and my dad is 70, and because of the pandemic they just wanted to get this type of stuff taken care of), and I found out that my parents are leaving a significant chunk more money to my sister. She's 25 and I'm 31, for context.\n\nThe reason they're giving her more money is that my sister has a neurological thing and is on a couple expensive medications, so they're setting up a fund for her medical expenses that will be separate from her inheritance. I'm not trying to minimize anything but don't think my sister's condition affects her life that much. She has a full time job (she's some kind of HR assistant) and goes to spin class and post pictures on instagram of her and her friends going out for drinks and seems to be pretty much fine. Apparently she might become disabled at some point, but she's definitely not now and her life is totally normal from what I can tell. \n\nHow it's going to work is that my parents are setting aside a certain amount of money for her medical bills, and then splitting the rest of the money evenly between the two of us. I don't really NEED my parents' money (I work for a large tech company and make low six figures) but it's a matter of principle for me. I might have medical bills too one day, so I don't think it's fair that she'll have money already given to her for her medical problems but if I ever get cancer or something I'll have less money than she will to pay for it. I know it's my parents' money and they can do whatever they want with it, but they've always said they love us both equally so I think things should stay equal. \n\nI haven't really talked to my parents about it yet, but I've been thinking about it a lot and I don't know whether I should say something to them.\n\nAITA for wanting things to be fair?","send_replies":false,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_subscribers":2744334,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA for being mad that my parents are leaving more money to my sister than me?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.63,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/i1k5hq\/aita_for_being_mad_that_my_parents_are_leaving\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}
