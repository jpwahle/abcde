I went for an ultrasound to be examined and I was found to have a slightly fatty liver and 2 polyps on my gallbladder. The doctor said that I had a large amount of gas and that it was probably causing me a problem. With diet regulation and a little more physical activity the pain disappeared after a week or two, in the meantime covid, quarantine followed, and I went back to eating fast food and sugar. Two months ago some discomfort in my stomach started to happen, rarely pain, I don't have cramps or pains I can't stand, mostly it's some discomfort or feeling like my stomach is working, it's hard to explain. I went to a gastroenterologist where I was told the same results as the year before (only she said that my spleen was also a bit swollen because it is on the border between normal and **enlarged** , but she is not sure because I am a big man 2 meters 118kg, while the last doctor he didn't say anything about the spleen) She recommended that I do a gastroscopy to find out what the stomach problem was and that it would be good to remove the gallbladder because that could be the cause of those stomach problems, she also told me that I had a large amount gas in the stomach. I returned my diet to normal, determined to get my liver back to normal, although it is not an excessive problem, they told me, because of our way of life, it is not considered such a big problem when the liver is so slightly fatty. However, a new year followed, Christmas where I overdid it a bit with food and often ate softly and those discomforts that disappeared reappeared, only now my left side of the abdomen is a problem, sometimes it stings under my ribs, sometimes I feel itchy, sometimes I feel as if some organ is enlarged, I feel as if my rib is slightly enlarged or it is just a feeling in my head, sometimes i have sharp pain under rib. Of course when I touch that left side it happens a lot to burp or fart, so maybe again it's just the gases in question. I read somewhere that there could be both pancreatitis and an enlarged spleen, although that was not the case on the ultrasound from two months ago. Also t I do not have nausea, ie I very rarely have them, I have never vomited, I have never been disgusted with food, I have a normal stool, I have no bleeding in it and my complete blood count is fine except for one liver enzyme that falls out of the box but I regulate with  whey. I know that my main problem is that fast food makes me gas and I try to get rid of it completely, I try to put as much walking into my life as possible and I believe that it will help me solve a lot of these abodimal problems. I also sometimes feel heartburn, not so often, but when I overdo it in food, I think I said everything, if someone has some experience it would be nice to share, also the pulmonologist I went to because of some minor breathing problems thinks that because of these gas or because of something going on in my stomach that causes me to breathe, because I often burp and fart, and when I go up the stairs I know how to burp a couple of times. I'm 23 years old and maybe this seems like a lot of what I wrote, but I actually feel good, the only thing I'm worried about now is that the left side is swollen or something ?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TooAfraidToAsk","subreddit_id":"t5_2ssp7","subreddit_subscribers":1245344,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Stomach problems ?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TooAfraidToAsk\/comments\/l9poaf\/stomach_problems\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I'm a 22 year old male studying computer science in England and tutoring to make some money. I am 6'2 and weight 232 lbs (105KG\/ 16'8). This is my issue and this is what I want to get motivated on. Over the post four years ives gained nearly 50 lbs and I'm finally taking initiative and I' going to fix myself. I'm doing this not just for my physical health but also my mental health and my own self confidence. My goal weight is between 189 and 196 lbs. Not perfect but its healthy. Honestly, I don't know the specifics of how I'm going to do this, but I do know a few of my goals. The first and most important is loosing weight. I want to lose a minimum or 2 lbs a week for the first month. At the turn of everything month I want to increase this by 2 lbs until I reach either 10lbs or my goal weight.\n\nHow do I plan on loosing this weight? The first change is cutting out Coca-cola entirely. Right ow I' drinking about 4 cans a day. For the first month I plan to switch this out with a healthier substitution such as 7-up free. The second major change I'm going to cut out is Fast Food. This week alone I had three takeouts for dinner. Fucking stupid. I can cook, and I do enjoy a lot of healthy foods such as fish and lean meats like chicken along with vegetables and fruits. It's just its easier to get take aways or frozen foods and this is what I need to change.\n\nFinally I want to start exercising. I love running, or at least used to, I haven't done it in four years. The same goes for swimming, but when I started putting weight on I lost all confidence and couldn't even take my shirt off around family. So the plan for the next month is to run. I've even got a schedule planned. Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday are running days, with the other days walking. I've got a treadmill so I can easily measure may progress. This first week I plan to walk 0.25 of a mile, run 0.25 of a mile and then walk 0.25 mile again. Then on walkings days I'm going to walk 3 miles. Even week I going to increase each running distance by 0.25 of a mile. I'm not sure what speed I should run at so any suggestions would be amazing. After this month is done I'm going to look at myself in a mirror and try and get myself into a pool.\n\nWhy am I telling everyone here? I want to start some sort of log. An interactive one. Every night I'm going to make a post. It's going to describe what I ate. The total calories. How my running went and how I'm feeling and to get advice. I honestly don't know where I can do this. If I can do it here that would be amazing but if I can't, would any of you guys be interested in me creating a sub so we can all do it together? I'm not sure. But for today, would anyone be interested in giving me somme good advice? Foods to eat, activities I can do. Anything would be great.

I did it, I created a routine and it was nice at the beginning, but after a while, it became boring. Now I can't stand the idea of having \"fixed points\" throughout the day.\n\nI also felt like I needed more control (like, painstakingly note every euro I spent) on small everyday things, so I started controlling everything: It was fun and nice at the beginning, boring now.\n\nI thought going to live far from home would have been great and at the beginning it was, it helped me, but now is... just not that wonderful.\n\nSo, the point is, Will life always be this way? Will everything I *feel* I need\/will help me eventually become irrelevant, if not boring? Will everything eventually \"became grayer\"? (in my language, this expression has a meaning I hope also in English has)\n\nI'm asking for a specific reason.

I would think about him everyday. My dog used to sleep in my room and I used to wish him goodnight. Even though he is gone, I still continue doing it just hoping to see him in my dream as my coping mechanism. It makes me feel that he's thinking about me just as I'm thinking about him. \n\nThe night before, him and I were hanging out in our front yard and I see him sitting on the floor watching me. Moments later, I had an argument with some neighborhood kid and he shoved me.(Although I'm 21yo this year, I must've been younger in my dream) My dog stood up and barked at him, protecting me.\n\nLast night, I dreamt that as I walked out to his area where he was at. I saw him below the table and I went beside him trying to pet him. He was licking my hand as I tried to pet him.\n\nI've dreamt of him once or twice before, but when I saw him 2 nights in a row I feel like he's up there watching me. I miss him so much.\n\nThanks for listening.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"confessions","subreddit_id":"t5_2qq6g","subreddit_subscribers":809515,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I dreamt of my dog 2 nights in a row","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":2,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.91,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/confessions\/comments\/l9q0ig\/i_dreamt_of_my_dog_2_nights_in_a_row\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

On the first Monday I worked, I made it into the gate before 6:45, nervous as all hell; chill in the parking lot until 7 o'clock, until I was called to report to the office trailer a half mile out from site. Thomas, my foreman, gives me the DBIDS that will let me on base, a hard hat and a pair of too big gloves, along with an oversized safety vest. \"You have to go do the safety thing with Walsh, do you have any tools?\"\n\n\"Yeah actually, I've got hand tools and some other basic electrician's tools in my car.\" I say. \n\n\"Go get those and I'll take you up to the site in my van, it's quite the walk. You'll do the safety presentation tomorrow.\"\n\nI gather my stuff and head out to my deep blue Chevy trax which I lovingly called the Tardis, grabbing my tools and kicking up dust with my boots on the way back. Thomas meets me outside, sitting in an idling Milcon van. I climb in the passenger side, my heart racing. \"So, uh, do you know what I'll be doing?\" \n\n\"Well, to be totally honest with you, our journeyman on the second floor told me he was in desperate need for a ground person, and your score on the test peaked my interest. I think you'll like Arthur, almost everyone does.\"\n\n*Arthur, huh. I wonder to myself. Wonder what he looks like.*\n\n\"What's he doing up there?\" \n\n\"Running conduit pipe, he should be able to teach you everything you need to know.\" The older man looks at me in the warm dawn light with a grin. \"You look young, do you mind if I ask how old you are?\" \n\n\"It's rude to ask a lady her age, but if you must know I'm 18. Graduated a couple months ago and didn't want to go to college; my dad suggested I do electrical and this is where I ended up.\" I explain, feeling young and inexperienced. \n\nHe nods. \"Well, I hope you learn a lot, little lady. We're all nice here.\"\n\nThe ride to site only takes a few more minutes and he parks outside an opening, the van clock reading 7:05 as I put on my hard hat to slip out of my seat. I hear various tones of male voices filtering out, seeing 10 or so men in high visibility clothing gathered around deep metal chests. Thomas and I head inside, and he takes me to a tall, chubby man chatting with another tall, slightly less chubby man. I manage to hear a snippet of their conversation about politics before Thomas gets the attention of the slightly less chubby man with a clap on his shoulder. \"Arthur, come here.\" \n\nArthur's gaze turns to us, a wide grin plastered on a bearded baby face. Deep set swampy green eyes look out from behind safety glasses beneath a dirty hard hat. \"Oh, good morning!\" I watch his eyes go down, and up my body with a certain gleam. \"Who's this?\" \n\n\"This is your new ground woman, Ms\u2026\" Thomas trails off. \"I don't remember your name, wasn't it Kayla?\" \n\n\"*I* go by Ripley; Kayla is my mom.\" I say out of habit, then my eyes check out the other man with no shame. \"You must be Arthur.\" \n\n\"That is who I am,\" the dorky looking man says, extending his hand. I give it a shake, feeling a well calloused but soft palm meet mine with a firm grip. He smiles at me, making me slightly less nervous. \"It's nice to meet you, *Ripley*.\"\n\nThomas claps a hand on my shoulder.\"She had a great score on the math part of the test, so don't be afraid to test her. Have fun.\" \n\n\"Trust me, I'll test her,\" Arthur says with a wink, and I feel my cheeks warm up a bit. \n\nThomas walks off and I turn back to my journeyman. \"So, he told me you were running conduit pipe?\" \n\n\"That is correct, do you know how to read a tape measure, and do you have one?\"\n\n\"Only since I was a kid, and indeed I do.\" \n\nHe grins once again. \"Good! You're already ahead of the last apprentice I had. Let's go up stairs. \n\nEver since I got to work at seven, he has taught me all he knows about how to to measure and bend the conduit. My eyes occasionally fall on his sizeable bulge and well toned biceps as he teaches me, me trying to make it subtle but probably failing. By the time nine fifteen rolls around, he has decided that it's time for a test. \"Just take your time and double check your measurements,\" Arthur says, \"Ready to do one all on your own?\" \n\nI nod. \"Just give me the measurement and angle.\"\n\n\"Alright, cut a piece of pipe 21 and 5\/16ths inches long, and give me a 45 bend at 12 and a half inches. Bend it upwards 90 degrees at 18 and 7\/8ths.\" He smirks at me and I roll my eyes. \n\n\"Jesus christ, couldn't have made it any harder, could you?\" I crouch down and get a scrap piece of pipe about two feet long, marking and cutting those few inches off. The two angles are bent and I hold it out to him. \"There. Satisfied?\" \n\nHe takes it and studies it with furrowed eyebrows, then gives me a look from under his hard hat. \"Nice job, you deserve your first reward.\" \n\n\"Reward?\" I ask, nervousness swirling in my stomach at his tone. But, a small part of me is turned on by him so I stand my ground. His watch goes off and he checks it. \n\n\"Break time, come with me and I'll show you a good spot to relax and be left alone.\"\n\n*Is this dude about to fuck me?* I think as I follow him through the mostly empty second floor. My panties wet and I bite my lip. *It's not like I'd stop him, he's so hot.*\n\nA minute later, he leads me into an alcove (with no one around) and I lean against the wall, pulling my phone out of my front pocket to check my notifications. Suddenly, he is standing in front of me, within 18 inches of my air space and I gasp. \"You scared me.\" I say, slipping my phone back in my pocket. \"What do you want?\" \n\n\"You.\" He mumbles, bringing a hand to my waist and pushing me back against the wall. He closes in around me, his height pretty much completely trapping me. I feel his boner rubbing against my leg and bite my lip. \"Good apprentices get rewards, don't you know that?\" \n\nI am too nervous to say anything but still nod, unsure of what to do but not wanting it to end.\n\n\"Hmm,\" He hums, his hand going between my legs, gently stroking the seam directly underneath my pussy. I whimper and then immediately blush. \"It's alright to enjoy it,\" he whispers in my ear,\" I've wanted to fuck you since I saw you this morning.\" His plush lips peck at my neck, the tip of his tongue draws slow circles, and I moan quietly. \n\n\"God, please fuck me.\" I beg, desperately palming at his denim clad crotch. With a low laugh, his hands go to my hips and I am turned around. My chest is against the drywall, my ass sticking out towards the older man. \"Oh I meant to ask,\" I say breathlessly as he unbuckles my belt,\"how old are you? Wait, fuck; I don't have a condom.\"\n\n\"Thirty,\" My pants are unbuttoned and the zipper pulled down,\" and I got a vasectomy earlier this year, so you have nothing to worry about.\" He pushes my pants down around my knees, along with my panties. \n\nI moan as his fingers massage my clit, hear the sound of a zipper, then I feel the head against the opening of my pussy. In one swift thrust, he buries his entire, large cock inside me and I gasp. \"Holy fu-\" I am cut off by his large hand over my mouth.\n\n\"Shut up,\" his other hand grips my hip as he fucks me, pleasure rolling through my body. My back arches with multiple orgasms within the first few seconds, the feeling repeating itself, my moans muffled. \"God your pussy is so fucking tight,\" he says with a moan, then I feel warmth and his dick pulsing inside me. He groans as he cums deep inside me, pulling out and immediately pulling my panties back up. My legs shake and I whimper, feeling cum leak out of me.\n\n\"Holy fuck,\" I mumble. \"I love this job.\"\n\n\"See?\" he says, buttoning his pants and buckling his belt. \"Good workers get rewards.\"","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BDSMerotica","subreddit_id":"t5_2soa5","subreddit_subscribers":59909,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Ground Woman [Mf] [Reluc]","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.96,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BDSMerotica\/comments\/l9q7e1\/ground_woman_mf_reluc\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

It didn't. The hirsutism got worse. It was horrifying and if you're on this thread, you can probably imagine the toll it took on me.\n\nFast forwarding through the years, different doctors were so adamant that it was PCOS (without even testing for it). At one point, I was so sure spearmint tea would save me. My blood tests and ultrasounds showed that I didn't have PCOS, but that didn't stop them from testing me for it for a few years. Once they realised they weren't getting anywhere with the PCOS investigation, they slapped \"idiopathic\" on to my hirsutism - and that was **devastating**. I felt like there was no hope after that.\n\nIn 2018, they found my prolactin levels were higher than normal. I did an MRI to see if I had a prolactinoma (a **non-cancerous** pituitary tumour that is totally manageable so please don't freak out). Prolactinomas can sometimes be the cause of hirsutism. My MRI didn't show any tumour.\n\nIn late 2020, my prolactin levels got even higher, so now I'm being treated for a potential tumour (which I don't fully understand). I am hoping that the medication will shrink any tumour and stop the hirsutism.\n\nObviously, not all stories are alike. But those who are struggling to get a proper diagnosis may want to **check your prolactin levels**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nManaging my hirsutism:\n\n* My hirsutism is quite severe. I've tried tweezers, wax, epilating and laser.\n* I went to a fancy clinic to get laser treatment for a year. It was painful and all it did was give me acne and drain my money.\n* Best thing I ever did was buy the Philips Lumea IPL laser. It's quite expensive (\\~\u00a3300-\u00a3400) but so worth it. It's way cheaper than the clinical lasering in the long run. I have tan skin and dark hair. It hasn't gotten rid of all the hair but I'm kind of lazy and it's a lot of hair.

We are both foreigners, and both living on a foreign land - I emphasize this because of Sagittarius placements. I am 26, and he is 55. And we have a daddy-son dynamic in the relationship, and we are kind of goofy! And I've never felt this deeply for a human being. However, we both intuitively know that this can't last for long - due to relocation issues.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1- The North node South node conjunction, does it mean that we are related from past lives, and each of us has learned the lessons that the other one is going to learn in this life time, so we can help each other master these lessons?\n\n2- Does this rectangle pattern count as a mystic rectangle, and do you think it brings conflict and tensity as described in the internet pages? \n\n3- Would I be overinterpreting the DC - Venus - Jupiter - Sun Sagittarius combination if I thought this as a karmic (I know everything is karmic but...) relationship that has to happen? \n\nthank you!

My dick is just under 8 inches, and it's pretty thick from what I've been told. I've been with numerous women throughout my life, and just about every one had told me I have a big dick. Its nice to hear, but I've always just kind of taken it with a grain of salt, because I dont know if that's something girls just say to every guy. I know I dont have a small dick, but I've never been one to brag, to others or myself, about the size of my dick. I'm comfortable with it, that's about it.

Shes perfectly thicc. We do have sex as often as we can, but the problem is that every time we do it, she is very sore for the next few days, and is generally unable to fuck. We both want to do it way more, but she just says I stretch her so much and it just wrecks her. She tells me shes never had this happen with another guy. We tried switching from generic lube to this \"gun oil\" lube that a friend of mine recommended. The lube definitely makes things easier, but we still cant have sex more than once every couple days, and even then, I can tell shes in pain when we start, she just gets over it I guess.\n\nIs there anything I can do myself to prevent this from happening? Any positions, products, anything any all?  We both really want to just fuck over and over, but shes legitimately sore after even a 15 minute fuck session.

Starting from IT basics\/fundamentals, up to different coding languages and upward. \n\nI know I've seen the question asked and answered many times, but how feasible is it really, to self-study diligently and get proficient enough in CS and multiple in-demand coding languages, acquire whichever certifications necessary, and land a good entry-level position into a company with good growth opportunities, WITHOUT a degree or much related work experience? \n\nI would like to learn the basics so I can be as knowledgeable and effective as possible in future work, and study for any beneficial certifications I should acquire (ITF+, A+, N+, etc) to be as attractive as possible to potential employers. That way I can be prepped for whichever path I take in CS (but software development is ultimately the goal). I've seen a lot of the different subjects, but with so much to learn, it's daunting trying to figure out where would be the best place to start and what would be the best order to learn things in. I just don't want to take on this goal and waste time struggling to learn something because I should have learned another subject beforehand. I know I could look at a university or college's curriculum, but I wanted to get some real world experience and input from you all. \n\nI'll buy you lunches, dinners. I know some carpentry and a dozen other trades. If you live near me, I'll barter labor if I have to, if I can be mentored or guided down the most effective and successful learning path. Any help would be greatly appreciated. \ud83d\ude4f \n\nAlso, are there any decent companies (in Austin) that would be willing to start you off with a reasonable customer service position or something comparable, and nurture a path for growth in tech?\nI live in Austin so I know I'm in a huge tech hub and I'm wondering if there are any such opportunities with companies willing to train based off performance. (I know Spectrum is one, but I've heard several stories and might try to leave that as last resort. \ud83d\ude05) \n\nI'm ready and willing to hit the books and internet hard to learn whatever I have to learn, in order to start my best path into tech. I'm 29, no family or kids, I have enough money saved up to quit my job and study full time for a little while, or work\/train for free to prove my commitment and work ethic somewhere, once I have any required certifications. I'm aware, and have no problem with continuous learning. Stagnating and not becoming more knowledgeable is what's driven me crazy. \n\n\n\nI know it's an old topic that's been beaten to a pulp, but I just wanted to ask the question my way and get some fresh responses.\nI greatly appreciate y'all. I'm new to reddit and sad to not have wandered into this community a lot earlier in life. Didn't know so many helpful and caring people existed.

drinking has been pretty consistent for about 10 years now. When I was younger, it was recreational... rarely was I really drunk, but I consumed regularly. \n\nAbout three years ago, after some hellish circumstances in my life, I started drinking heavily to cope. I had a couple poor experiences with the health care system and mental health services, so I kept my medication but kept drinking.\n\nI've had my fair share of embarrassments. Humiliating circumstances. Lost a couple jobs over the years. But while those around me expressed concern, I still felt like I had it in check. \n\nWell, this week it all came to a head. I've lost my wife. My kids. My home. I'm currently in a hotel room, waiting to talk to my daughter for the first time in almost a week.\n\nI've failed everyone. And if I'm honest, the challenges ahead feel absolutely insurmountable. I have little money, few friends, and I'm desperately searching for some light to emerge to keep me going. \n\nBut I'm 2.5 days sober. I spent the first part of the week trying to drink my way through the pain. Friday? I took a shot. I went back for another, looked at it, and made the choice. I poured it out. I poured it out. \n\nI've had nothing to drink since noon on Friday. Withdrawal anxiety, plus the crushing circumstances I've created in my life, are the closest things to unbearable I can imagine. \n\nBut I'm not drinking. I'm not drowning myself and others out. I'm NOT drinking.\n\nI'm not used to being open about my failures, but my life needs a new approach. So I'm reaching out for support. I'm going to need it, I won't be able to do this alone.\n\nIWNDWYT","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stopdrinking","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7yr","subreddit_subscribers":297073,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I've known I have problem for a while now, but always felt like I was still in control.

I'm just here, enjoying a quiet evening on what's almost certainly the eve of a snow day, and generally being very happy that the east coast finally actually got some real snow. Hopefully your days are all similar so far and your tomorrows promise to be full of weather-related excuses to have a less than stressful start to your weeks.\n\nIt's in times like these that I really realize just how lacking I am in the area of physical, mental, and just general local female companionship\/someone to come home to after busy and relaxing days alike, and to spend quiet mornings in bed with. So here I am looking for a girl\/woman\/female person, ideally local to the DC area, with whom I can make a real connection, a friend with benefits who is a real friend in addition to any fun benefits. Exactly what form that can take is pretty open-ended as far as I'm concerned, and I'm more than happy to see where any connection might take us, including an actual relationship or anything and everything that the future might hold. In short, I'm looking for someone with whom I can just as easily share a kinky night of wine-fueled fun, or give a back rub while watching Jeopardy or similar shows.\n\nAs for a little bit about me, I'm 28, from the DC area, and pretty much your standard suburban, college-educated young person (I have a B.S. in Biology and currently work in a Virology lab if that's relevant to your interests). I'm also your typical redditor in terms of being generally introverted and nerdy. I'm not completely socially inept, as one does have to have several solid groups of friends to play as much D&amp;D\/other board games, Pen and Paper RPGs, and tabletop wargames as I do. In addition to my many creative and academic hobbies (I'm one of those who researches interesting things for fun) I'm also a fan of music, and something of a musician myself. I've been playing guitar for 13 years and go to quite a few local shows (when they're happening of course), especially of the hard rock\/metal variety as those are always full of energy and fun. If you happen to sing or play an instrument that would fit well with a guitarist I'm sure we could especially have fun together with that.\n\nAs for the all-important physical information, I'm of pretty average proportions, being about 5'7\" and 150 or so, thick, wavy brown hair and brown eyes, and a proclivity for having longish hair and a moderate amount of hair on my face. I've once or twice been likened to Jon Snow or Inigo Montoya, so make of that what you will.\n\nAs far as what I'm looking for in a partner physically, I'm attracted to a wide range of body types and physical features, and someone's mind and personality are of equal importance to me as looks. I only ask that you be generally clean, interested in me, and either local, close, or otherwise able to have fun in person on a regular enough basis once we've established enough mutual comfort to do so (and once pandemic restrictions allow of course).\n\nAs for the \"benefits\" side of friends with benefits, I should probably mention that I'm decently kinky, having a good few years experience as a Dom and being generally fond of Dom\/sub play. I'd describe my overall style in that regard as being generally caring, but also controlling, and that the core of any such dynamic for me is a deep mutual connection based on the level of trust and comfort required for a sub to completely surrender herself to me, to expose herself and make herself vulnerable, knowing that by me being in control, I'll always have her pleasure in mind as well as my own and will be there to support her and help her be the best sub and best person that she can be. I'd be more than happy to discuss individual kinks if we go down that road, but up front some of my main ones these days are role-playing (go figure), costumes\/dress-up in a Dom\/sub context, collars, harems, and fun vanilla things like generally exploring a girl's body and either teasing her to either a wonderful release or denying her until she's begging.\n\nSo yeah, hopefully that wasn't too long and boring to read, but if you happened to see this, are interested, and think we might be a good fit together, don't hesitate to send me a message at any time. If I'm not asleep, I should generally be around and responsive. I'll definitely be looking forward to your little orange envelope, and to the awesome person on the other side.\n\n**tl;Dr Nerdy science-y type seeks a special someone to really connect with on a deep and meaningful level, physically, personally, romantically, or hopefully eventually all three and more.**","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtyr4r","subreddit_id":"t5_2vqun","subreddit_subscribers":545628,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"28 [M4F] (Washington DC\/Anywhere) Seeking Snowday Fun with some Real Staying Power","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtyr4r\/comments\/l9qqm8\/28_m4f_washington_dcanywhere_seeking_snowday_fun\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

If you want to talk politics eventually that is fine, but I'm not into debate or trying to change people's minds.\n\nNow that that is out of the way, i love reading. I mostly read fantasy, but some scifi and historical non-fiction are good too. I love being able to get into characters heads and exploring new worlds. I love the way that books can influence the way you think about things.\n\nI love music and listen to everything. And i do mean everything, my playlist will go from kpop to black metal to country to classical songs right after each other. I've had a friend complain that we had listed to only listened to 10 songs and he had heard 10 different genres.\n\nAs for other random stuff i love podcasts, concerts, hanging out with friends, shooting guns, playing games, working out, and watching TV.\n\nIf you are interested feel free to message me or send a chat, i do prefer to talk off of reddit though.\n\n[this is me](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/rXzVCvS)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"r4r","subreddit_id":"t5_2rn0e","subreddit_subscribers":410474,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"32 [m4f] usa - looking for a relationship.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.6,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/r4r\/comments\/l9qy8p\/32_m4f_usa_looking_for_a_relationship\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

As a kid I told my mom who didn\u2019t believe me and assumed I was plotting against my brother (i am rolling my eyes so hard while writing this but oh well..). I am 30 now and 5 years ago I confronted my whole family about this and specifically my mom. Now they believe me and are trying to repair the harm but holy fuck CPTSD is hard. I am also queer and being in a small town full of homophobes didn\u2019t help.\n\nAnyway being home is hard because my mom has this pattern of always doubting what I say. It seems casual but it\u2019s like we are so different that it seems whatever I say is unbelievable and you can imagine how triggering it is coming from her. Her not believing me ruined my life. She admits somehow her mistakes but still doesn\u2019t take full responsibility (she \u00ab\u00a0doesn\u2019t remember\u00a0\u00bb)\nFor instance i was complaining about a chair at dinner being super uncomfortable and she wouldn\u2019t believe it until she sat on it. Its\u2019 frankly exhausting to be met by doubt, dismissiveness or defensiveness everytime I share an opinion.\n\nAlso she is so invasive with my personal space. When i ask her to move she gets offended. She knows i have trauma she met my therapist in the past who explained that my symptoms were real. \n\nI dunno, i feel depressed and I was struggling already the past few weeks regarding mental health and being in this environment is so draining. I just want to give up on trying to repair I feel I have worked so much on this and give so much energy to it and she does those ridiculous baby steps.\nIf I am still able to talk to her it\u2019s not about anything she has done but because of all the work I did in therapy. I am so angry and hurt and tired of her entitlement and laziness in being a fucking decent human to her child.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"CPTSD","subreddit_id":"t5_2vvid","subreddit_subscribers":116333,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Venting - my mom drives me nuts","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CPTSD\/comments\/l9r1ea\/venting_my_mom_drives_me_nuts\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Height: 173 cm. Weight: 146 kg.\n\nHave been fighting obesity my whole life, but with no long-term success. Up to the age of 9 I was abnormally skinny, refused to eat a lot of foods, but at the age of 9 I started to love almost all the foods and gaining weight. Tried weight watcher's diet a few times with my mother, but it was unsuccessful.\n\nSo at the age of 16 my weight was 98 kg, then my parents took me to a diet specialist who had a pretty unconventional approach - a specific diet plan where you always had to eat at the same time with 5 hours between each meals and you couldn't have any snacks in between and had to eat only the specified food. It was very effective - I lost 25 kg in two months. And it required no exercise.\n\nBut after my weight loss I started eating like crazy - triple amounts of what I ate before the diet to finally feel 'full'. I also started binge eating in secret from my parents - eating in my car, saying that I have some errands to run, but actually going out to stuff myself, secretly bringing food into the house. So in less than 2 years I regained old weight if not even more.\n\nAbout 5 years ago I found out I have insulin resistance. I was 148 kg at that time. Tried same old diet.  Got to 108 kg in 4 month. My aim was 90 kg, but I was mentally exhausted and gave up. This time I really tried to control myself to not gain weight. Every week had 1 scheduled 'fasting' day where I ate only like 400 calories. Still didn't last and I regained my weight in about 1.5 years.\n\nThis Summer was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, weight at that time 155 kg. Started just eating healthy - low carbs, no sweets, bought a bicycle, started taking walks to the shop instead of car. Lost about 10 kg, but it was so slow and took so much effort. While I could easily exercise in summer when the days were longer and I could easily take walks and bicycle rides even at 20-21 o'clock it was not possible anymore during deep Autumn.  I just gave up and regained my 155 kg.\n\nThree weeks ago bought so called Stockholm diet. Got to 146 kg, but it was absolutely miserable experience. Most of the offered foods were disgusting. No salt was allowed. 100 g meat per day, mostly vegetables. I just gave up and started binge eating again.\n\nI had such a mix of emotions - angry at the world, angry at myself, angry at my body that tries to regain every hard lost kilogram, envious of slim people who never have to think about what they it and don't gain weight. Like one of my acquaintances just posted a picture where he's at the restaurant and eating french fries with some fat meat and a big serving of ice cream. He won't gain even 1 gram from it, but I would gain 2 kilograms instantly If I ate such meal. I eat junk food like burgers or pizza only few times a year, I don't eat sodas or juices, drink my cofee\/tea without sugar, eat sweets only tops 2 times a week and I still gain weight.\n\nAt this point I'm just ready to give up. I know I'll eat myself to death, but at least I'll die a happy man instead of trying to win a lost battle. I know it's quite futile to just try dieting without changing your life style completely, but I just can't imagine living without food I'm craving. I'm a big foodie and foods that I like just makes me happy - more than anything else. Plus, thinking how slow and long it takes to lose my amount of weight just kills any motivation for me.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"loseit","subreddit_id":"t5_2rz8w","subreddit_subscribers":2835713,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Losing Weight - Unwinnable Battle","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/l9r5o6\/losing_weight_unwinnable_battle\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I'm considering not following it exactly.\n\nMy wife and I budget $50 weekly per person for whatever we want. We may or may not sacrifice a bit to max our Roths, but dont make a ton, and we just get the match on 401ks.\n\nI'm not the kind of person to buy a lot of small things. I'm more of a save it for a while and then go on a big trip which involves buying gear or something. \n\nWhat do you think of investing something like $25-40 a week into a taxable account? As our income increases, I'd even to like to put more in to build toward passive income in my 40s. I'm 28.

And to say the least I am very confused. The following is something like a diary entry I wrote sometime this week. I wanted to share it to get some opinions of other people to help me find answers. Thanks a lot in advance people! (I'm 20 and amab btw)\n\nI dont understand what I am thinking or feeling. When I read about trans people i get kinda sad and terrified. I am extremely terrified I am one of them but i dont really feel like i can relate to their stories. I just don't know if what I think think I believe is actually true. I dont know what is up with me. I keep having the same train of thought every single time:\nIn my childhood I always did regular boy stuff, playing football, building legos, fighting imaginary lightsaber fights you name it. \nI always kinda had issues with my body. I always felt (and to some extent still do) as if I were to chubby around my belly and chest and my arms too thin, too short, too hairless. When I reached puberty I never felt uncomfortable with my genitalia. I wanted to grow a beard, gain muscle mass, have more hair on my body etc. I remember occasionally thinking that my life could be better if I were a girl, mostly when I was thinking about how I wasnt good enough for the girls I had crushes on. I guess I was (maybe still am) jealous of how girls have all the choices when it comes to dating compared to guys like me who basically have to be happy with who ever they could get. (Ik that's not true IRL)\nBut I never related to girls the same way I did to guys. Almost all my friends are dudes. My hobbies, my interests etc are rather stereotypically male and when I am around people I enjoy how i am. It does not feel wrong at all. The opposite in fact. Yet I am here writing basically the same text for the 1000th time and questioning my very essence. I know that I dont wanna be transgender. Everytime I think about it I feel horrible. I feel constricted in my chest right now. I dont think I feel trapped inside my body. I dont really know what that would even feel like. Neither would I know what being feminine feels like. What I know is that I have felt masculine. Rarely but I did. And when I did it really felt great. Right now i don't feel masculine. I feel like shit. I dont wanna think about this as much as I do. When I ask myself if I always felt like I was a girl or if I rn feel that way my initial answer is no. But I'm not certain eversince I started really questioning. I feel like if I were a normal cis guy I would be certain, wouldn't I?\nIf I had the chance to push a button and be a girl from one second to the other i dont know if I would push it. I probably wouldn't hate it. I think I might even like it. But I dont know if that would actually be me or if it would be the girl version of me. The girl version would definitely be someone I would like. But If i met my clone i would like him too. Yet I dont really like myself. But I am not my best self right now.\nIf did a thought experiment. I wrote down what I'd be like as a woman In a perfect life 5 years from now and i had a hard time imagining myself in that role. And while writing I didn't really feel better than before. Then I did the same thing but in a perfect scenario as a guy 5 years from now. And that was fun. It went way easier. And afterwards I felt really good. As good as I've never felt while discussing my gender identity with myself. I was really happy for a moment and that is very rare these days. I just dont know what to make of all this. I just wanna live a happy life, preferably as a guy and not worry about this stuff. But I dont know how this will stop. One more thing that is keeping me question is that I sometimes look at girls photos with envy. I think to myself that I surely wouldn't mind looking like that girl on that photo. I wanna feel as desired and as desirable as these women probably feel when they look in the mirror. The thing that's terrifying me the most is that I cant even leave a single thought unquestioned when I think about this. Am I maybe in denial about being trans? But if I were in denial would I be even able to ask myself that question? And if I'm not in denial, why the fuck am I still on about this. I'm as scared as I've ever been in my entire life. I just want answers","send_replies":false,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"asktransgender","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4b9","subreddit_subscribers":172405,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Questioning my gender identity","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/l9ratp\/questioning_my_gender_identity\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I truly cannot. I cannot actually  be expected to prick my fingers 5 times a day and inject myself twice  when this wretched thing slows my rate of healing. All my dreams are  gone, crushed.

I predict some  of you will try to give me some tough love, but I do not care. I've  always been a giver-upper, even before diagnosis. Yeah, I guess I am  weak. I give up, and I'm not even a week in. Sorry, but I can't do this.  I will do the bare minimum because I am afraid of death, but I will be  leading an empty facsimile of a life. I refuse to try and cooperate with  this disease. All or nothing, diabetes gone or bust. People telling me  to fucking treat it as a friend, fuck that shit. I don't fucking deserve  this. I know people say nobody deserves it, but I, me, moi, in  particular do not deserve this.

Toward the end of 1st year they eased off a bit.\n\nMy 2nd year started off well in that we had to do those clinical worksheets for the first week, just to make sure we knew what we were doing, and then no more worksheets the rest of the term. &gt;90% of our clinical time was spent doing patient care, and it was great. By the end of the term, I was handling 3 patients mostly on my own. \n\nNow the new term is starting, with a different clinical instructor, and it's like I'm being transported back to first year. We have several worksheets that need to be completed each week. Also, we're going back to just having 1 patient the first week and maybe by the end of the term we will have multiple patients. \n\nI'm frustrated that the expectations of the students aren't building off of last term. My hope is that the instructor just needs to see and realize that I (and hopefully my whole clinical group) know what I'm doing and will relax the reigns a bit and not hold us back. Next term is our IP experience and then we're graduated. I'm just frustrated that I'm 4 months from graduation and we're still filling out these stupid worksheets.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"StudentNurse","subreddit_id":"t5_2vqzl","subreddit_subscribers":92067,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Clinicals reintroducing busywork this term (I'm mostly venting)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.81,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StudentNurse\/comments\/l9re0d\/clinicals_reintroducing_busywork_this_term_im\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}
