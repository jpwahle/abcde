This isn't sex related in the absolute physical sense, but I'm beginning to get so crazy that I need to vent somewhere, so please bear with me.\n\nIn the last year of my life, I came to the realisation that I was suffering from depression, and probably had been for a long time. Therapy and talking to close friends has helped, but ultimately it's not all fixed yet. A very large part of what I'm worried about is directly related to this subs content: sex, and relationships in a broader sense. One of the most significant issues to me is that I have never felt attractive; I have never felt 'sexy' or desirable, or anything close to it - quite the opposite for most of life. I hate my body: I'm 5 foot 10 tall and I weigh about 55 kilos (120 pounds). This combination of never feeling desired / attractive, and disliking my image has lead to extremely low self esteem, an issue I still struggle with now. \n\nHow does this relate to /r/sex, then? I feel that one of the primary reasons I have low moods and bad self esteem is the fact that throughout my entire life I have always been spectacularly bad with women. I have some very close female friends whom I treasure dearly, but as soon as it stops being platonic I become a failure. I don't wish to make this a \"I'm 19 and haven't kissed a girl yet\" kind of post, but to be honest, I'm coming up to a three year 'anniversary' of the last time I had any kind of intimacy with another person, and every day that kills me a little more inside.  \n\nAnother side of this for me is that I am still in love with the same girl I met when I was 15. To me, she's perfect. I don't need to go into why, I'm sure many of you will understand what I mean when I say I think she's the one. She, of course, has no idea how I feel about her, and I'm not planning on telling her anytime soon how I feel. How could I? She's essentially the 'permanently in a relationship' type anyhow. \n\nThe last part of what's on my mind pertaining to all this stuff is the uglier part. I am actively starting to feel jealousy of my sexually active friends; friends who are happy in relationships; friends who are just able to 'pull' or 'score' or what have you, and this jealousy has started to manifest more properly in the form of anxiety / panic attacks. \n\nHelp me, /r/sex! I'm a goddamn cocktail of shit right now. I wanna cuddle someone, I want to love someone and to be loved, and for gods sake, I'd like to fuck something at some point as well. I am 19 years old, and I feel like I've already missed out on a crucial part of life by having not even kissed someone properly yet. \n\nIf this isn't the most appropriate subreddit for my submission, please message me and I'll remove it.

I look too young for my age, it sounds apathetic, but in reality it's ruining my youth and pretty much my life at the moment. I look like I am 16 or 17. I have no facial hair, I'm as tall as 5'7\" and skinny. Though I eat a lot, my high metabolism stops me from getting any big.\n\nIt's been complicated since childhood, I didn't grow tall until I passed out and joined college, I didn't have a normal life like my other school friends, they always looked more bigger and more mature by the time they turned 18 and me on the other hand looked short and had a kid-like face.\n\nI was always patronized and considered weak because of small stature. All this have really affected my personality, my confidence, my self esteem, I even feel socially awkward when I'm outside. To make matters worse I never had a girlfriend because I was afraid that no girl would want to date a guy who looks younger than them, pathetic huh?\n\nThough girls find me cute or what I have heard so far, I still don't have the audacity to ask a girl out because I'm afraid they would reject me for this reason. Being the only guy who never had a relationship among my friends really makes me depressed and feel lonely inside.\n\nI'm unemployed and am afraid to look for job since I developed this constant fear that no-one will take me seriously or even employ me because of my looks. When I go to a club or even as simple as buying a pack of cigarettes, I always get carded, which is quite embarrassing.\nI try to dress in a way that makes me look older; it helps a bit. Every now and then, I keep fantasizing that if I looked more like an adult my life would be different and I would be respected much more. Outside, I tend to look very cheerful and happy, but inside I feel miserable.\nMy friends say by the time I am 40, I will look younger and appreciate it but what they don't understand is I am losing my youth. I feel, maybe, getting into a relationship might help me get over the obstacles in my path, it might give me the boost in confidence but then again the irony is I don't have the confidence to ask a girl out, it's like a vicious circle.\n\nSo in short, I have no confidence, no self-esteem, depressed, stressed out, pessimistic, something I really hope no-one should go through. If there's someone out there who is in a similar situation, well my friend you're not alone.","media":null,"ups":12,"retrieved_on":1441192790,"created_utc":"1409531664","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"offmychest","domain":"self.offmychest","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"I look too young for my age and I F'in hate it!","secure_media_embed":{},"from_id":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2f4lb4/i_look_too_young_for_my_age_and_i_fin_hate_it/","from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","created":1409535264,"stickied":false,"edited":1409573897,"score":12,"quarantine":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":15,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"name":"t3_2f4lb4","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"archived":true,"id":"2f4lb4","from":null,"author":"juvenilemortal","is_self":true}

{"selftext":"A little about myself, I'm a young woman with a 2 year old and I'm separated with my husband and we live separate lives but in the same household still. Marriage has been up and down the past year but there is no shouting or physical violence we just are different. We are best friends these days and get along.\n\n\nOK this is going to be a long story....earlier this year in February I met a guy and we really hit it off even though there's a 18 year age difference between us, I'm 27 and yes he's 45. This was not an issue for me, I like older men and this is no secret to anyone. Now I started noticing problems right away but I stuck through for love. I fell in love with this guy despite him not having much money, not working, not driving, and a host of other red flags that'd send most women running after the first date. ( like the fact he has a Nazi hobby..)\n\nAt first it went good. I send him a huge box for valentines day, we knew each other for a week at this point. It left a bad taste in my mouth to see someone on Skype eating the chocolates I sent them, criticising the gift' telling me how the cookies could be better or how the chocolate was somehow flawed. I was rather hurt but I stuck it out. I'd never in my life given someone a valentines gift like that before.\n\nFast forward another week, we talk for a while and get to know one another a bit more, he has a complete meltdown and gets so mad at his laptop he breaks it. So I send him mine to have on his birthday. All is well again. Now, at the time I worked a part time job as a dental hygienist and was only able to talk from noon onwards so wed spend lots of evenings together. We have spent hours and hours together getting closer for a couple months.\n\nWell there was a lot of issues, he lied to me about his pot habit and had me believing he was a lonely misunderstood guy and he said he wanted to move to where I live which is 3 hour drive away. That was a lie. I told him a few times I wanted to end it and he ended up in tears and it was always because of trivial misunderstandings so we were on and off again a lot. He would get really sad and be loving and sentimental with me when I told him about all the child abuse I've been through and he had me convinced he was a really good guy just a bit misunderstood but now...now I'm not so sure. \n\nSo I told my husband about this guy, and he was OK with me seeing someone else as long as I was happy, he even met this guy in person and told him to take good care of me and was very polite and civil and always has been about this issue. When I met this guy in person he came over to my house, while my husband and son were away on holiday with my mother in law for a weekend ..they knew I had company. Well he lost his manners. I took him to the store and he farted all over the candy rack, I laughed it off. The clerk was pissed off.He drank my whole bottle of wine, I didn't even get a taste. He even farted a lot during sex and this made me lose it. He declined dinner I made for him, and slept the whole day. I got fed up and said I wanted to break up because it seemed like he had nothing invested in the relationship. I got a bit sad and I have a history of depression and cutting myself.\n\nThat upset him and he explained to me he only acted this way because he was sad to leave me and go back to his town. I ended up going with him back to his town and leaving my son with his dad a while so I can clear my mind and have some love in my life and sort myself out. Me and the husband talked about this a lot for months, about me talking to other men and leaving and he said it was fine and made him happy if he could see me happy. Well I missed my son and it got to me, this guy and I were fighting a lot' and I became a bit of a drunk. Lots of lies, and ups and downs. He lied about being related to Eisenhower ( he's British, we live in UK ) and he lied about his grand dad being some Russian WW2 Peter Kreshnov guy, and then lied about his family being Lithuanian SS members. ( this guy is obsessed with Nazis and loves to dress up as them, had a tattoo covered that was eagle and swaztika, has a whole cabinet full of Hitler and SS dolls and memorabilia reproductions...) not to mention he told me he would cum in a bottle for a gay friend of his for five dollars when he was nineteen, and that he's done loads of drugs before and hes never had a relationship that worked out.\n\nI had an IUD in place, and somehow got pregnant by this guy. I had a miscarriage ..it wasn't an ectopic pregnancy but I have problems and need a lot of bed rest and help to sustain a pregnancy due to having a bad cervix. Me and this guy broke up and I came back home and found out while getting tested for kidney pains that I was pregnant. My IUD slipped down and the baby implanted high up and the doctors told me it was viable. The IUD removal caused damage and I lost the baby 3 weeks later because my cervix never closed back up. He was not there with me, we had just spent time together being a loving couple ( other than the fight we had til 5 am over a stupid frying pan he couldn't leave alone, and telling me he would leave me to be a single mother because he has so much going for him where he's at that he wouldn't move to be with me. The guy rents a room in a house that belongs to a transexual obese Pedo for Christ's sake.) \n\nFast forward, well needless to say the miscarriage was hard on me emotionally, he wasn't there because he was too broke, didn't even call me once while I was in the hospital because painting a shack for \u00a35 an hour was more important. So lucky me, I got occasional text messages once every few hours. So this messed me up, I held my dead son in my hands and had to have a D &amp;C and nobody there for me at all. I went a bit ape shit, I went A.P.E shit. I told him I needed some space, to take a break and clear my head for a few days. He broke down crying. He wouldn't let me take a break when I emotionally needed it and my hormones were crazy. So I kept going ape shit on his ass. I had no more patience at all. I rubbed it in really good too, made sure he knew what he did was wrong and told him how fucked up he was and how I'm sick of his insecurities and overreactions to trivial shit. \n\nSo apparently I pushed him too far and he tells me HE needs a break from me. That's it, I'm not told for how long, or what the rules are. He just says basically \" I need space goodbye.'' To put it simply. But then he contacts me every day..I mean what the fuck? He sends me tiny messages saying \" have a nice day xx\" and I don't hear from him in like a day then he does it again. So you know what I do? I make some friends, get in touch with old ones and block his ass from contacting me. He told me during my ape shit episode to go kill myself and denied the existence of the pregnancy I lost then told me he was sorry and loved me more than anyone he's ever loved before...what the fuck!? but somehow I can see past that but he can't get over me calling him a no good piece of shit. I'm starting to see I'm the lesser evil here. So a lot of my friends happen to be male, they all have girlfriends and we just talk and I'm one of those people that needs a lot of attention and talking a lot is very therapeutic to me. Well apparently I'm an untrustworthy slut deserving of no respect because I have male friends on my Facebook and I go in chat rooms. What the fuck does he care, he wanted space and he got it. I have a life too. So he has the nerve to tell me, when I ask him for a chance to make it right that he needs to go away and think some more since I have male friends. He is a manipulative and mean person I think. I live with my husband for gods sake and this guy is worried about men on Facebook? Insecure shit!\n\nI told my husband all this and he is not happy. Not happy at all and we are considering working our problems out and getting back together now and working on a healthy marriage but I need time alone out of relationships for a while. And this man how dare he do this to me. I'm supposed to hear from him apparently in the next few days. I'm not looking forward to hearing from him, as I think now I hate him a bit. I try to work things out and all he does is accuse me, jump to conclusions and act like a bitch. Yeah he bought me some things, and made me feel loved sometimes. But is this worth it at all?\n\nI needed to vent, this is messed up as hell. What the hell is wrong with this Person. He gets mad at me people find me attractive and compliment me, he whines about my male friends judging him. You bet your ass they judge him. He gives them all the ammunition himself. Yet I'm to blame. Never mind my several female friends, its all about the males..all of whom are engaged or in serious relationships and are there for me like brothers I never had. This is shit. He's like a baby or overgrown over dramatic child from hell, how can I just get over him and have the strength to walk away? I can't do this any longer, this is by far possibly the worst relationship I've ever been in.","media":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1441192777,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2f4m9m/relationship_is_destroying_me/","thumbnail":"default","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Relationship is destroying me.","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1409532282","subreddit":"TwoXChromosomes","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.TwoXChromosomes","edited":false,"score":1,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r2jt","created":1409535882,"from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2f4m9m/relationship_is_destroying_me/","secure_media":null,"stickied":false,"from":null,"author":"[deleted]","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":2,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"name":"t3_2f4m9m","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"id":"2f4m9m","archived":true}

{"retrieved_on":1441192720,"ups":451,"media":null,"selftext":"I told this story to a few friends of mine a few days ago and they said I should put it here. Sorry in advance that its so long! The events took place between 1997 and 2009. I'm 23 now.\n\nIn the Fall of 97, my mother took me, my sister, and my sister's boyfriend out to the movies in a neighboring town. My sister got to pick the movie and the only showing we could catch was a late one, so we didn't manage to start our way home until around 11:00 pm. (Most of the details of this specific event have been relayed to me by my mom and sister.)\n\nWe were close to home, driving down a back road. I was asleep in the front seat and my sister and her boyfriend were in the back. A cop car came up behind us and drove behind us for a while. Then after about 5 minutes of following us, turned his lights on. My mother says she hadn't been speeding and was aware they had been following us, but she pulled over.\n\nMy mom and sister say a man came to the window and didnt ask for ID or registration and started asking mom where she lived, saying there had been a robbery nearby and her vehicle matched a description of the getaway car. He asked her to get out and she said no. It was at that time that my sister's boyfriend leaned his head into the front seat to see what was going on. He was the local sheriff's son and the man must've recognized him because he immediately got nervous and told mom to go on home and walked back to his car. My sister's boyfriend said he didn't recognize the cop at all and mom drove around for 20 more minutes in circles to make sure he didnt follow us home. Mom would later tell me that there had reports a few months later of a man pretending to be a cop stopping and raping women in the area.\n\nFor the next 11 years, nothing else happened and everyone pretty much forgot (or at least, I did. Mom always remembered.) But then, weird stuff started happening at home.\nMy mom and dad had gotten a divorce in 2002 and my sister went off to college the same year. In 2003, we had moved to a house pretty much in the middle of nowhere with only a couple neighbors. The lock on our door was loose and I, being a forgetful high schooler, would often lose my key and have to card my way inside after I got off the bus.\n\nOne afternoon February 2008, I noticed a car come to a stop in front of my driveway as I got up to the front door. I didn't think anything of it, but the car stayed there as I carded the door. If it stayed after, I didn't notice. But after that day is when somebody started breaking in.\n\nNow, I don't think whoever watched me go inside could've seen me card the door, but they must've figured it out because mom and I would often come home to find things...not the way we left them. Nothing was ever taken that we could tell. One day a painting above the couch in the living room ended up propped against the opposite wall. Another day all of the medicine and first aid supplies were moved from above our washing machine to the kitchen table in neat rows. My mom began to suspect it was a woman named Susan who was in love with mom's boyfriend, trying to scare her into leaving him. They had been in many arguments and the woman had said something about watching her before, so it was natural for us to assume that.\n\nWe ended up changing the locks about 4 months into 2008 after finding our house broken into about 5 times that we know of, as it was 5 times we found things rearranged. That seemed to do the trick. However, whoever was harassing us found a new way to do so and began calling my mother and me on our cell phones. It was always from a blocked number and they never said anything. They would hang up the second we said hello. They were calling all hours of the day at least 10 times. They would call me while I was at school, while mom was at work. We eventually stopped answering any number we didn't recognize and after 2 months, the calls stopped.\n\nMy mom was still convinced it was Susan. I asked her why she would be calling me and how she would've even gotten my number and my mom didn't know. In late 2008 the Susan moved several towns away to be with her daughter, who had gotten pregnant. We were sure that it meant the end to all of the nonsense and we could forget about her. \n\nIn early 2009, my boyfriend proposed to me while he was overseas in Iraq and I started planning on moving away with him when he came back in May. One evening in March, I went wedding dress shopping with a friend of mine who was also getting married around the same time as me. My mother was out of town, taking my grandmother to a specialist 9 hours away for an appointment, so I was home alone for the weekend. When I came home that night, I noticed immediately that something was wrong as I drove up the street. \n\nEvery light in my house was on. Even my mother's bedroom and bathroom lights, rooms that I had not been in at all since before she left. As I pulled into the driveway, I saw that the front door was wide open. I started to panic and called my friend's fiance, who lived 5 minutes away and told him I was too afraid to go inside. He showed up right away and went in my home, checking the rooms for me.\n\nAfter 10 minutes he came back out. He told me he had checked every room and closet and there was nobody there, but that I needed to see my room. I followed him back in and went to my room. It had been ransacked. My drawers had been emptied out onto the floor, my closet had all the coats and shoes removed, my vanity was covered in spilled makeup. On my bed was my underwear. I checked my mother's room and it was the same. My friend's fiance hid his car in our pasture and stayed awake in the living room all night, hoping whoever it was would come back. They never did.\n\nI cleaned up the rooms and acted as if it hadn't happened, but I didn't leave the house anymore. When I told my mom, she again blamed the Susan. She told me she had found a pair of women's underwear at her boyfriend's house and he had confessed they were Susan's. She had confronted Susan, threatening to expose her to the church Susan was a pastor at, and she assumed this was the woman's counter.  \nWhile my mother just seemed to get angrier, I became intensely paranoid. On any given night, a noise outside or the glimpse of headlights would give me panic attacks. I was sure someone was after us and mom didn't believe me.\n\nIt all came to a head one night in May at 3 in the morning. I was awake, waiting for a call from my fiance. My mother had long since gone to bed. I noticed a flash of light through my curtains and quickly began to become anxious. I told myself it was probably just a car or somebody's porch light coming on. But I saw it again, and again, roving the yard. It was a flashlight. \n\nI climbed out of bed and crept into the hallway connected to the living room. There was a window right next to the where the hall lead into the living space and I didnt dare move any further as the shades were up. I could see the flashlight moving around the back of the house. I waited for several minutes and eventually could see it in the front yard again. My mother must have seen it too because suddenly she was in the kitchen next to the front windows whispering to me across the room.\n\nShe asked if I had seen it and I nodded. She said somebody had tapped on her window and she had seen the flashlight. She moved the front window curtains and pulled them back a bit and said there was a car in our driveway with its lights off. She said she couldnt see the flaslight anymore. They must have seen her because there was suddently a loud knock on the front screen door and we could hear it moving as somebody tried to open it. We didn't move for about 30 seconds and again, there was a loud knock. \n\nWe heard a man's voice yell \"Hello! Is everybody alright? It's the police!\" Mom crept over to the front door and opened it partway, but left the screen door closed. From my vantage point, I could see it was just one man.\n\nMy mom told him, \"Yes we're fine. Sorry we didn't answer, we were scared. We saw a flashlight in the yard and didn't know it was a cop.\"\n\nThe man replied, \"Yeah, I was looking around to make sure everything was alright just in case.\"\n\nThat didn't make any sense. My mom got confused and said, \"Yeah, everything's fine. What's going on?\"\n\nThe cop seemed to get annoyed with my mom for some reason and told her, \"We got a 911 call from here and there was nobody on the line, just a lot of heavy breathing, and we thought you'd had a break in.\"\n\nMy mom clearly wasn't buying this. She quickly asked him, \"Yall only send one guy for a break in and walk around the yard for 10 minutes? And who called? I was asleep in bed.\"\n\nThe cop sighed and said, \"I was just being careful. Somebody called 911 from this residence on your landline and we came to investigate.\"\n\nBoth of us knew immediately that it was a lie. My mom told him, \"We don't have a landline. We haven't had a home phone in 6 years.\"\n\nThe man threw himself against the screen door and shouted at my mother. \"Let me in, Teresa,\" he yelled at her, using her first name. My mom yelled and shut the door in his face. He banged on the door several times and my mom called her boyfriend. She yelled at the man that she had called the police and that he better get out of here and leave her alone. It seemed to do thr trick because the banging stopped and in a few seconds, we heard his engine start and he drove away. While we waited for mom's boyfriend to show up, mom asked me if I remembered how she had been stopped by a man pretending to be a cop when I was little. She wouldnt say anything else, but I've come to suspect that the man who came to our door was the same person who stopped her that night.\n\nWe relayed the whole thing to her boyfriend and he advised we actually call the police and tell them everything that had been happening to us. We heeded him and found out there actually had been a call to our house from the our home phone number with nothing but heavy breathing. We never found out how that wouldve happened.\n\nWe havent seen the man since. I moved away at the end of June and mom never had any more break ins or calls from blocked numbers. Whoever the man had been and whatever his intentions were, he seemed to have gone. \n\nI came down in September of 2010 to visit my mom for a week. I spent a lot of that time napping on the couch while she was at work. On the evening before she took me back to the airport, my mom compained about me leaving smudges on the front windows. I got up to see what she was talking about and my stomach leapt into my mouth. I told her they werent smudges.\n\nOn the front windows that look right in on the couch that I had been napping on were a pair of large splayed hand prints.  \n","permalink":"/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/2f4qo4/we_dont_have_a_home_phone/","link_flair_text":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"We Don't Have a Home Phone","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.LetsNotMeet","subreddit":"LetsNotMeet","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1409535312","quarantine":false,"score":451,"edited":false,"stickied":false,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2t3t8","created":1409538912,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/2f4qo4/we_dont_have_a_home_phone/","from_id":null,"is_self":true,"author":"lemonhydrangea","from":null,"archived":true,"id":"2f4qo4","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_2f4qo4","over_18":false,"saved":false,"num_comments":80,"author_flair_css_class":null}

I'm 19 and am rather fresh out of high school in my country. I always played a ton of sports growing up, and ended up playing Ice Hockey in a local \"grown up\"-team, until almost one year ago.

I still lift my own weight, after one year of not doing shit. The same goes with my legs, my stomach and all the other body parts. It's like my muscles are hiding underneath the fat.\n\nI think that I would need to lose muscle size as well as fat, but I really don't know how to do anything but gain muscles.

I have been doing well for two years now but previously have been hospitalised from starving myself. I have good days and bad days but more and more the good have outweighed the bad.\n\nMy bf was my first, and he also knew this. It took a long time to feel sexy around him and to let his compliments drown out that nagging voice in my head that I'm fat and ugly and unworthy of any man. It took me a long time to have sex with him with the lights on. It took a lot of trust and I felt I'd finally gotten to the point where I believed he was happy with my body.\n\nOne night i was on his computer and accidentally stumbled across something he'd searched on google (autocomplete filled it in) about not being attracted to his girlfriend anymore. I was extremely worried about this and actually woke him up to talk to him about it. I probably over reacted but he had been acting a bit distant lately and i wanted to know if that was why.\n\nThis is where the shock came. He said that he loved me and still was attracted to me, but that he was less attracted to me now because I had GAINED WEIGHT.\n\nHere's the thing, my weight hasnt changed at all. In fact I weigh a few pounds less than when we met. I'm 5'8 and 130 pounds, by the way. The heaviest weight I've ever been but I know it's healthy and it's taken a lot of work to get up to this weight and maintain it.\n\nAnyways I told him this and he didnt seem to believe me. He said that muscle weighs more than fat, maybe i'd lost muscle and gained fat, etc. pointed out we'd been eating a lot of fast food. at this point i broke down crying, i felt like my eating disorder was talking to me.\n\ni ended up actually having to get on a scale to prove to him i didn't gain weight. when he saw 130 on the scale he said he was shocked. he was upset and apologetic but just kept saying \"i thought you'd gained weight\". definitely didn't make me feel better.\n\nanyway we stayed up all night and talked about it. we love eachother and want to make this work. he said it all started when i was especially insecure one night and wanted the lights off during sex. i don't recall this incidence, sometimes i just want the lights off, but it seemed like a big deal to him and apparently he started wondering why i was insecure and eventually assumed i'd gained weight bc of the fast food we'd been eating. for 2 weeks he was convinced i'd gained 10-15 pounds. he apologised profusely, said he didnt know what was wrong with them or why he thought that, said i was so beautiful and that he loves me, etc. he was a wreck, bawling at the thought of losing me or hurting me for something like this. then i started to feel bad... i'm the one who saw it on his search history and he hadn't even meant to bring it up. what if i'm taking out my insecurities on him??\n\nhe blames himself, says he's stupid for thinking that, that it was just a thought, that he's back to normal now and attracted to me 100% again. i want to believe him but something doesn't sit right. \n\nalso it's been extremely difficult to be intimate with him. he said he'd noticed weight gain around my stomach and now every time he touches my stomach I start to get panicy. he's been extra sweet and lovely dovey and apologetic but i still sometimes feel utterly undesirable and hideous. i've tried telling him how this has made me feel about myself but he'll just break down crying and i'll end up having to comfort him and say it's not his fault. which it's not, i can;t blame him for thinking a certain way and didnt mean to find out... but it hurts.\n\ni love him. and he loves me. but its so scary to think hes been just as critical of my body as i am. im not articulating well i'm sorry. i'm just a mess right now. i dont know if i'm overreacting and i dont want to lose him over this. he's offered to do couples counselling and i wonder if that would be helpful. just wondering if you guys have any input.\n\n\n\n---   \n**tl;dr**: My boyfriend thought I'd gained weight when I didn't and I'm having a lot of confidence issues as a recovering anorexic\n","retrieved_on":1441192715,"ups":23}

I am in the infantry there are no girls here. When I do go out in town I never do anything bad, hell I feel bad even talking to a girl so I refrain from it. I've gone out 4 times in in months. She went out 4 times in 2 weeks.  Regardless her mind runs and makes up these things that didn't happen. Also we always fight over Instagram pages I follow.

I never message any of these women ever. I have 1 girl as a friend she has many guy friends. I am the most laid back person I never give her any shit when she goes out or the guys there.

It's a guy with his arm around her and another girl on his other side. She is kind of pushed up against him wearing the shortest shorts ever. I told told her she can wear whatever she wants and I don't care until I see stuff like this. And lo and behold it's\nAnother fucking Co worker. After we just had a talk about this. When I go out to edm festivals I have plenty of pictures with my friends and other girls but I never put my arm around them and push up next to them. I make sure of it because I know how she is. She says it was okay for her also because the guy is ugly but honestly he looks like a normal dude to me.\n\nWhat bothers me the most is that she did what I asked her not to do. And also the 2nd time when I mentioned it she got all sad and said she sorry and that i was right in saying she would have been mad if i did that to her .Then she talks to her girlfriend and a couple hours later we talk and she said it was okay because it was her friend and I shouldn't be mad and that it wouldn't have mad her mad if it were me in the pic with another girl. When 90 percent of our fights are over girls she had dreams of me fucking or Instagram girl pages I follow (not individual pages but like the ones girls with tatts) or girls she imagines to be here. I know for a fact she would be mad because before deployment I came home from a year of not being home met my best friend and his gf who is also my best friend, we were at the bar and I held her hand for a minute saying how much I missed home and all this and how much I would miss them while I'm on deployment. All of of this in front of my girl. My gf got so mad at the me for this. I've know my best girl friend and my best friend 10x longer than I've known my gf. So I feel like the scenarios are completely different because he is just a Co worker that that she sees everyday, so it's not a special occasion to see him. I see this girl once a year if I'm lucky since I joined 2 years ago. And she got mad over that but is saying she wouldn't get mad if I did what what she did. I'm starting to get sketchy Vibes and I really love this girl so I need help. Do I just drop it. What do I do. Help\n\n\nSorry about the length\n\nTl:dr my gf takes pics with guys and says I shouldn't get mad when I do things so much less sever and get bitched out.","media":null,"link_flair_text":"Relationships","permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/2f4rcd/do_i_have_a_right_to_be_mad_please_help/"}

We were young boys, just hanging around, playing games. The romance with girls was too hard at the time, we didn't get them at all. Me and my old time friend were hanging around his flat a lot and played old PC game called Commandos.\n\nThe friend was much more popular with girls, partly because his older brother was quite popular and there was a lot of action going in their flat.\n\n1 - So on a usual day we sit down and play as usual and he starts going into topic about girls and this thing he found exists. Blowjob. He explained to me what it is and the quite suddenly suggest to suck my dick. This was rather tricky, since I really felt that passing an opportunity like this is unwise.\n\nHe gets under the table and puts my dick in his mouth, while I continue playing the game like it's no big deal. Soon he gets tired and comes out. We are silent and then he asks: Do you want to try to? It's fun.\nI kind feel bad not to return the favor and say okay. I stand up from the table and he goes back a few steps, while pulling his dick out. I always liked his dick - it is about 8.5 to 9 inches really something to have. So I drop to my knees against his dick and at that exact moment the phone rings. \nHe takes it. It's his grandma and I watch silently while he talks. He places his hand on my head and just shoves his dick in my semiopen mouth, while talking with his gran. Soon I started noticing that he intentionally prolongs the chat, but I don't mind. I liked the sensation of my mouth filled. We stopped right when his telephone conversation ended.\n\nThat was the first time.\n\n2 - We were quite sensitive on gay stuff and couldn't fully confess that we enjoy this stuff, but it was so nice, that our young psychologies found a way out. GAMES! Simple games in which the loser had to do something stupid. \nOne of those games was with cards. The one who draws a card of least value has to \"freeze\" in position that the winner chooses. You guessed it, the positions were like \"On your knees with your mouth open and eyes closed\".\nAt this time I understood that I enjoyed being on submissive side a lot more. Once he put me in bent over position with pants down snd I didn't even guess what he wanted to do.. that until he places his dick against my vrigin asshole and tried to push. I jumped 3 feet forward and looked back angry.\n\n3 - As we grew up our games turned into simple bets. Like there was this time were lying around my flat on the floor and he goes 'I would totally suck you right now, but to lazy to stand up' when I mirrored his phrase he casually jumped on my chest with my hands under his legs and places his dick on my face. WHen I tried to yell that this is not fair he put it in.\n\n4 - The first time he really took advantage of our relationship is when we were stayin abroad with our class. We shared one room and in the afternoon he barges in running from girls room. \"Look you gotta help me out with this shit, it's serious' What?' I have a bet with girls about the size of my dick, please help me get it up, I will make it up to you, please. So the first time I sucked him on demand. ANd of course I proceeded to make annoyed remarks and stuff.\n\n5 - Once we had a little party with our third friend, who was not onto us. We started drinking heavy and he decided to go to the next room and play CS. My friend pulled his dick out and I sucked him for 15 minutes, while our mutual friend played in the other room.\n\nThere are more where that came from)","permalink":"/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/2f4rt9/the_fun_i_had_with_my_friend_for_many_years/","link_flair_text":null}

I tend to want big things, either physically large in size or just a big deal. I obsessed for a while about tattoos, piercings, and stretched ears. I finally was able to get my helix (cartilage) pierced, but I can't get any more piercings until I'm 21. It was either agree to the deal and get pierced then, or wait until I'm 18 and then get whatever I want. I, being the impulsive person I am, got the piercing. I don't really regret it (more piercings could affect job opportunities), but it's an example.\n\nAnother thing I've obsessed about is getting a reptile. I was dying for one when I was younger, but over the years it kind of went away a little. Then, when I found a post on /r/portland asking for someone to room their snake for three months, I became completely OBSESSED with them. I still have that snake (until some time in September), but I also just had to have my own little guy. So now I have a snake of my own that I had to buy (I paid for the snake itself, and my parents paid for all the supplies). I think I also gave the reptile bug to my brother. We were looking at garage sales and someone had two leopard geckos for sale. I impulsively wanted to get them even though I was preparing for a snake. Then, since my parents denied me, my brother asked and was allowed. They sold out once we went back, but we ended up getting a bearded dragon for him instead.\n\nAs soon as I had gotten that snake (last Saturday), I began fixating on wanting an axolotl, or at least some fish. I justified it by saying I would get it after the other snake was gone, so I could have something to put on that wardrobe. In my mind, it made sense. That way, the surface would be taken up so I can't make it messy (I'm really unorganized for someone with OCD). I also told my parents that it would be the last pet I got while under their roof, since there's no other space for something else in my room. This, of course, did nothing for my case and I was turned down.\n\nI also keep getting my \"I want a car\" switch turned on and off again. I'll suddenly decide I want a car, go on craigslist, pick a few out, and ask my parents if they'll pay half (I don't have enough to get a car, only pay half for an inexpensive one). They say no, and I don't blame them at all. It's ridiculous to suddenly decide I want a car RIGHT THEN and go ask them for a ton of money.\n\nBasically, I'll find something unreasonable to want reeeeally badly. Then I begin to research everything about it. I subscribe to subreddits about the topic, find the item I want to buy and any accessories needed, and then go to my parents. I'm driving them absolutely crazy, and killing myself inside because I get my heart so set on something out of reach. Is there any way I can calm these obsessions? I would love to not want all these items and just be happy with what I have. I'm afraid I'll end up broke and in a house full of reptiles or something."}

I've been procrastinating since 6th grade and i'm really tired of it because it's not that I don't want to lose this weight, it's just that I have no support system and have a horrible habit of being lazy. Every time I mention wanting to eat better and exercise my mom always laughs at me and says \"Yeah, that will last about a week!\", which is right, but it really doesn't help me want to try any harder. She is always buying what's on sale and what looks good, which isn't really snacks or super horrible things but when she buys bacon or makes italian salad I just binge. Other than that I don't really eat too often, sometimes I even miss days because I honestly don't even think about it which is what bothers me the most because I know that fasting doesn't help with healthy weight loss at all. I definitely do not drink water often enough.. mostly apple juice and milk. I know, I know, bad. I even bought a super cool water bottle to motivate me to drink more water but it just sits in the cabinet while I think to myself \"Maybe I should whip that out later\" which obviously hasn't happened yet. I used to go biking regularly which I really enjoyed and actually got pretty toned calves from, but the person I used to do it with doesn't want to go anymore, and my parents won't let me go out alone since I am female and don't live in the best area. We have a treadmill in our basement but I just don't really like they way it feels, and I never know if what I'm doing is enough. I got some healthy foods for me to eat for lunch at school which I'm very excited about! I don't really know what I'm asking here... maybe some tips on how I can be more motivated and force myself to do what is best rather than what is easier? I'm honestly the kind of person that really won't do much unless I am threatened or forced to which sucks because even though I wan't to do something (say cleaning my room) I will just never get around to it unless my mom threatens me with something like taking my phone or my computer. And trust me, I've tried taking things from myself but it just doesn't work the same knowing that I can just go get what I want any time since I'M the one who hid it. I'm not happy with myself and the choices I've made to be at the weight I am at right now, so I am really ready to do whatever I possibly can to get down to my goal weight of 105lbs.

{"selftext":"I'm a recovering anorexic and my boyfriend knows this. I have been doing well for two years now but previously have been hospitalised from starving myself. I have good days and bad days but more and more the good have outweighed the bad.\n\nMy bf was my first, and he also knew this. It took a long time to feel sexy around him and to let his compliments drown out that nagging voice in my head that I'm fat and ugly and unworthy of any man. It took me a long time to have sex with him with the lights on. It took a lot of trust and I felt I'd finally gotten to the point where I believed he was happy with my body.\n\nOne night i was on his computer and accidentally stumbled across something he'd searched on google (autocomplete filled it in) about not being attracted to his girlfriend anymore. I was extremely worried about this and actually woke him up to talk to him about it. I probably over reacted but he had been acting a bit distant lately and i wanted to know if that was why.\n\nThis is where the shock came. He said that he loved me and still was attracted to me, but that he was less attracted to me now because I had GAINED WEIGHT.\n\nHere's the thing, my weight hasnt changed at all. In fact I weigh a few pounds less than when we met. I'm 5'8 and 130 pounds, by the way. The heaviest weight I've ever been but I know it's healthy and it's taken a lot of work to get up to this weight and maintain it.\n\nAnyways I told him this and he didnt seem to believe me. He said that muscle weighs more than fat, maybe i'd lost muscle and gained fat, etc. pointed out we'd been eating a lot of fast food. at this point i broke down crying, i felt like my eating disorder was talking to me.\n\ni ended up actually having to get on a scale to prove to him i didn't gain weight. when he saw 130 on the scale he said he was shocked. he was upset and apologetic but just kept saying \"i thought you'd gained weight\". definitely didn't make me feel better.\n\nanyway we stayed up all night and talked about it. we love eachother and want to make this work. he said it all started when i was especially insecure one night and wanted the lights off during sex. i don't recall this incidence, sometimes i just want the lights off, but it seemed like a big deal to him and apparently he started wondering why i was insecure and eventually assumed i'd gained weight bc of the fast food we'd been eating. for 2 weeks he was convinced i'd gained 10-15 pounds. he apologised profusely, said he didnt know what was wrong with them or why he thought that, said i was so beautiful and that he loves me, etc. he was a wreck, bawling at the thought of losing me or hurting me for something like this. then i started to feel bad... i'm the one who saw it on his search history and he hadn't even meant to bring it up. what if i'm taking out my insecurities on him??\n\nhe blames himself, says he's stupid for thinking that, that it was just a thought, that he's back to normal now and attracted to me 100% again. i want to believe him but something doesn't sit right.\n\nalso it's been extremely difficult to be intimate with him. he said he'd noticed weight gain around my stomach and now every time he touches my stomach I start to get panicy. he's been extra sweet and lovely dovey and apologetic but i still sometimes feel utterly undesirable and hideous. i've tried telling him how this has made me feel about myself but he'll just break down crying and i'll end up having to comfort him and say it's not his fault. which it's not, i can;t blame him for thinking a certain way and didnt mean to find out... but it hurts.\n\ni love him. and he loves me. but its so scary to think hes been just as critical of my body as i am. im not articulating well i'm sorry. i'm just a mess right now. i dont know if i'm overreacting and i dont want to lose him over this. he's offered to do couples counselling and i wonder if that would be helpful. just wondering if you guys have any input.\n\ntl;dr: My boyfriend thought I'd gained weight when I didn't and I'm having a lot of confidence issues as a recovering anorexic\n","media":null,"ups":11,"retrieved_on":1441192650,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/relationship_advice/comments/2f4w4r/me_21_f_recovering_anorexic_found_out_my_bf_27_m/","downs":0,"thumbnail":"default","distinguished":null,"title":"Me [21 F] recovering anorexic found out my bf [27 M] of eight months isn't happy with my weight and I'm having a lot of trouble with it.","secure_media_embed":{},"created_utc":"1409539075","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"relationship_advice","domain":"self.relationship_advice","hide_score":false,"score":11,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2f4w4r/me_21_f_recovering_anorexic_found_out_my_bf_27_m/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r0cn","created":1409542675,"stickied":false,"from":null,"author":"[deleted]","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":5,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2f4w4r","id":"2f4w4r","archived":true}

Well I guess there is no real way to tell if you love correctly. Yeah? So I am 18, never had a boyfriend, never kissed anyone, never really loved a guy (I am perfectly okay with this). Until this year.\n I met this guy we shall call him Jake. Jake is 16 soon to be 17.  I met Jake my senior year of high school and we started chatting and getting to know each other. We would text everyday, make up bed time stories, and sometimes talk on the phone (because he isn't much of a phone person). Me and Jake were comfortable telling each other anything and we talked about our likes, our dislikes, our dreams, our fears, and etc at some point he told me he loves me and weeks later I told him that I love him too. There is a mutual trust and respect between us. I also genuinely enjoyed his company, when we did hang out he was quite the gentleman as well he-he.  So we pretty much talked about everything. Of course there was the flirting between us and I felt pretty darn special. At this point we weren't dating and he would often flirt with quite a few other girls. I knew this because he told me (When I say we talked about everything I meant it) and I did get jealous but since we weren't official I couldn't really be upset about it \n\nNow the reason we aren't official is because my dumb ass said that I wouldn't date him until he was 18 because I knew him and knew that he wouldn't do to well in a relationship (the kind that I wanted which was exclusive and potentially going somewhere). I found that I may have been right because shortly after he dated this one girl for a week and broke up with her because he wasn't ready (he told me this)\n\nThe only issue that I had was the fact that I was confused how he could get over the late night conversations, and pretty much every thing between us so fast.\n\nI did tell him all of this but he did not tell me how he felt about it. But he did say that he will always be okay with me speaking my mind and what not. We still talk but I told him there shall be no flirting, and so we remain on good terms. But I'm just worried because I cant see the future, I cant see what will happen in two years. I don't know if this is right and if I am doing the right thing.\n\nThis formatting may be pretty bad.\n\nI pray he never see's this cause he has a Reddit account.\n\nThis is my first Reddit post (don't know if that is relevant).\n\nBut I would oh so very much appreciate feedback of some sort because I Just don't even know. Thank You. :)\n\n\nEdit: I think I just realized what I'm worried about.\nI'm scared that I wont be able to find better\nI'm scared I wont be able to find some one who I am comfortable being around, someone who will make walk me to my car and ask if I got home safe after we hang out, some one who I can make bed time stories with, some one with an artistic outlook on life like me, some one who I can have the most random conversations with, some one who I can talk to about anything with who can make me feel special like he did. But I guess that's just a lesson of life. If it wasn't meant to be then oh well. Haha I'm gunna go cry now. Fuck.","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1441192624}

While there I was very out of breath when taking the stairs for the slides and I ended up having one of the worst migraines I've ever experienced. In fact, I had a doctors appointment scheduled for June 6 about the frequent migraines I had been having. They had been making me vomit and go blind in one eye. \n\nWhen we got home on the 5th I was having some pain near my left collar bone. I waited a day and told my mom but she insisted I pulled a muscle on the water slides. \n\nThe 6th I had to wake up early for my boyfriends high school graduation. Having got little sleep, around 2 p.m. (after the graduation ceremony) I tried taking a nap only to realize that when I tried to lay down my collarbone area hurt unbearably bad and I felt suffocated. I waited until midnight to tell my mom yet again how much pain I was experiencing. She said yet again that I pulled a muscle and told me to take some Tylenol. So I took 2 extra strength (1000mg total) Tylenol. \n\nIt didn't help relieve the pain at all. I was gasping for air and couldn't move. My entire chest and left collar bone were killing me. I was crying and begging my mom to take me to the ER. Finally, around 1 a.m. she did. \n\nWe pull up to the hospital and my mom is saying \"Are you sure you need to be here? We can still go home.\" I say yes and in fact need a wheelchair to get in because I as so out of breath. \n\nThat's when the doctor asked what medicine I was on and I told them (combination) birth control pills (which I had only started 4 months prior). They immediately ordered a CT scan and blood work. After a few hours of waiting, and my mom saying \"He's gonna tell you that you pulled a muscle.\" the results were in. I had a \"sizeable\" pulmonary embolism with multiple smaller emboli. \n\nI was shocked. I'm 19! I'm healthy! I don't smoke! As it turns out I have Factor V. I was started on Lovenox shots (ouch!) 2 a day for 10 days with Coumadin. After about 3 weeks my hematologist decided Xarelto would be a good fit for me. Now, almost 3 months later, I'm enjoying the Xarelto and have had no serious side effects. \n\nI just found this sub and I am so glad I did!

I'm 28 now and I've reached a point in my life where I'm trying to be comfortable with having a lonely future.  This kind of comfort is something I'm striving towards because I don't want to be regretful later in life about who I will become.  It's something I've truly come to terms with.  With that stated, I'll begin with what happened.\n\n\nToday was the end of FanExpo and I had a lot of fun.  I purchased a lot of things and said hello to a lot of friends.  FanExpo, for those who don't know, is basically like Comic-Con, (in terms of size and scope) but in Canada.  I was attending a final panel before heading home and my friend had started talking to this girl in 'Alice' cosplay behind us.  Now, please keep in mind, my friend is a... \"skirt chaser\" to put it lightly.  Me, of course, made no such approach, I was just talking about nerd things.  After a while, we all started to converse.  Just conversing! Nothing special.  Just an average nerd conversation to pass the time before the panel starts. \n\n\nPanel ends, time to go home.  My friend has go get his car so we go our separate ways and 'Alice', (we'll just call her Alice for the purpose of the story) follows me out.  We casually talk some more when someone suddenly asks Alice if he could take her photo.  So... for a second, I contemplate waiting for her... but then I realize, \"that's a little creepy.  I just met her.  There's no real reason why I should wait for this person who's simply going in the same direction as me\".  Anyway, I continue walking and head down the escalators and I stop to check my phone for a moment.  Suddenly, I see Alice hurrying down the stairs!... Looking for me!\n\n\nOkay, so please understand this.  No girl has ever actively went after me before in my adult life.  Not physically, not emotionally... no one! A girl actually enthusiastically trying to find me is unheard of in my lifetime.  So yeah! It's strange mixture of happiness and confusion tearing down all sorts of ice cold walls around my heart.  I need those walls for protection! That's why they're there! I felt like I could cry right there in the long public corridor.\n\n\nSo yeah, here's the thing... now I'm infatuated! But what I need to know is, because of my inexperience and my past, are my feelings legitimate or dangerous?  Am I reading into this too much and maybe she just wants to be friends is all?  Last thing I want is to creep her out just because I've never experienced a thing that most of the human population has probably experienced.  Could use some advice...\n\n\nAnyway, we ate Cinnabon together; talked some more; I gave her my card and then we parted ways.  \n\n\nTL;DR:\n\n- Girl chased me down at FanExpo.  Never happened to me before.  Emotional floodgates are open.\n- Am I reading too much into it? Am I being creepy about this?  \n\n\nEDIT:  I never got her name.  The card I left her is my only connection.  :/  She also pretty far away so any thoughts on 'hanging out' are out of the question.\n\n\nEDIT: I suppose I should address the issue that some may find I've been disrespectful to her.  This is true! I should've waited up and it's wrong to assume romantic intent simply because she's the opposite gender.  Rationally, I know this could absolutely be the case.  Biologically and chemically, my mind is clearly going in the opposite direction.  I'm usually able to deter the latter to just that, (because I'm smart and stuff).  My apologies to anyone who found my reaction to be sexist.  Clearly I wasn't thinking in those terms at the time.   Btw, there's a lot of posts here and I've read them all... thanks for replying regardless.

I'm 15 and he's 12, so we have lots of testosterone flowing through us and we just always find something to fight about. Today we were fighting over usage of the laptop (like most fights) and we got pretty physical. Eventually I told him \"Stop, the fight is over.\" But he just wouldn't. So I made a bad decision and threw my phone charger's wall adapter at him and hit him right in the painful part of the knee. Then he threw his cup of yogurt at me and I moved and it hit the TV. I yelled at him not to throw stuff in that direction and that was that. Tonight, my dad andmom turned on the TV to find it appearing cracked and discolored. Immediately they yelled at us. Then they left for the store to return the movie they bought.

So now it's 2 months.\n\nSo, I have to dress like a woman for 2 months.  the other thing was that there were no restrictions, so it includes waxing, hairstyling etc. plus dressing as a woman 24/7.\n\nShe's instructed me that I need to take the initiative and do it and make myself look as convincing as possible.  I need to do waxing, get my hair colored and styled (it's brown and she said to get it blonde or auburn or to get some highlights or something already pretty long; I usually pull it back).

{"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1441192591,"selftext":"Hey, I'm a kid in my early teens and I need some advice. I live with my mother, older sister, and my father. While my father has his moments, he is not as bad as my mom and sister. They are pretty bad, at least I think so.\n\nSo here is what happens. My mother is verbally abusive and she really IS a narcissist. I'll tell you guys what she does. She has told me things like \"You're lazy\", \"You're a buffoon who isn't prepared for life\", \"You're disrespectful\". She even made a joke about me looking pregnant. I got upset about it, she gave me dumb excuses like \"I only care about your health!\" I'm 5'3 and around 160 pounds. When she found out, she said \"Yeah, thirty pounds overweight.\" She's very obsessed with her own weight, too, and she's not even fat... She's like... 120 pounds maybe? That isn't fat at all.\n\nShe has gotten physical with me before, too. I've been slapped, pushed and shoved... Nothing too serious, but still physical. Maybe it's stupid for me to even be upset about this, I don't know. But anyway, I'll confront her on her abuse. She will deny it. She says she isn't abusive at all. I'm the abusive one to her, and \"What I'm doing is wrong!\" Okay, I confess, I say hurtful things. I hate that I do, I'm not proud of it. But that is how I defend myself here. That is how I fight back... I'm really trying to stop, though. I hope it doesn't sound like I'm justifying my behavior- I'm really not. I think it's terrible.\n\nShe will tell all her friends about how abusive I am to her, they believe her, too. They think she can do no wrong. They've even seen the things she does and says to me... and they think that it's okay. To them, she's doing the right thing. And to her, if I get sad or angry about anything, it's PMS. It makes me so angry. \n\nAnd now, the recent incident. I was feeling really depressed for some reason. I was lying in my bed, and my mom comes into my room trying to be all happy and funny or whatever (It was just an act, she does this all the time, it's never genuine), and sits on my bed. She put the pillow over my face and pretended to smother me. I told her I wasn't feeling okay and I would prefer to be alone right now. She leaves the room, cracks the door and peaks through, thinking she's being funny. I told her to shut the door. She gets pissed and yells \"I was only trying to cheer you up! DON'T YOU KNOW YOUR EMOTIONS EFFECT OTHER PEOPLE?!\"\n\nMy sister isn't as bad as her. She has slapped me, punched me, threw things at me, etc. To her, I'm a bitch. I'm weird and awkward, and immature. She'll talk about me behind my back to friends and then tell me that she did, and told me what she said. \n\nGuys, I'm so tired of this, I don't want to do this anymore.
