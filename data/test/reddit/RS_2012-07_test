This summer I&amp;#39;ve pretty much just holed up, occasionally leaving the house for movies or to smoke pot with a friend who doesn&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been considering the military since I just can&amp;#39;t seem to maintain a serious/rote schedule. I think it would be a breath of fresh air, and after I&amp;#39;m finished I can get back into school and get a degree (which they&amp;#39;ll help pay for). I&amp;#39;ve considered enrolling in CC, but I&amp;#39;m afraid I&amp;#39;ll be so dejected with it (I was at a great university) that I&amp;#39;ll fall into old habits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think I should do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I&amp;#39;m an escapist- I avoid and pretend everything&amp;#39;s okay, living a lie. Help me please. How can I move on?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1341189334,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

I try really hard to, but I just can&amp;#39;t seem to hold onto what people are saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want help so badly. I have borrowed many books in hopes to read them, and when I read something from an article I can&amp;#39;t recite it properly because I don&amp;#39;t remember!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1341188085,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

I have spoken to her about it and now I&amp;#39;m asking for the help of strangers because I don&amp;#39;t know what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, breaking up is out the question. I love this girl and I&amp;#39;m moving 3000km across the country with her so we can live with her family because I got a job in a mine. (She has also said we won&amp;#39;t have sex there much because we&amp;#39;ll be in the same house as her parents)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HELP!\n&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: Girlfriend just doesn&amp;#39;t seem to want to have sex with me anymore!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1341183103,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

I&amp;#39;m just really happy I managed to take my fairly jockish group of friends and introduced them to an entirely new side of themselves. A side that I also have.

And I have admitted full responsibility for the split, and though we don't talk anymore, I can't leave the past behind. You see my 9 month battle with my illness was made better by him. By his cannibis addiction. Through him I was opened up to the world of smoking and getting high and sure enough, It relieved all symptons. Visits to my doctors were less frequent and I was making really good progress. Actually, just before we split I had just got to grips with the bong, which was giving me bigger, better hits and thus making me more dependent on the drug. I have never smoked back at mine, simply because my mum was a drugs Councillor and she seems to think she knows everything about it (Which apparently are all  cons) So when i split up with my ex little did i know what i was letting myself in for. I guess the withdrawals started two weeks into the split, I started getting real bad pains again gradually they got worse and my sleep started to be affected again. Then I lost it, and when i say lost it, I mean I lost my progress, my health declined at a rate of no return, I was falling over like i was 90 odd. Under a week later, the inevitable happened.\nThere I was minding my own, and it hit me, like a physical hit. It was like someone took a knife to my spine. I knew full well I had no pain killers inside. I was alone. I headed to the stairs, to run a hot bath in efforts to numb the pain. Just as my toe touched the 14th step of the 12ft staircase, My legs gave way beneath me. My head dropped back, And I fell top to bottom, My head hitting each step as I fell. I laid at the bottom of my stairs in a heap for what seemed like hours. When I came round I found myself trapped under a table with my legs and back still halfway up the staircase. Luckily I had a phone to call for help. Admittedly my first thought was to call my ex. Then sense came knockingm I called my mum..Within five minutes, her friend had arrived and she called the ambulance. At this point I was screaming, I could no longer feel my legs and it really freaked me out. Once the paramedics arrived, they said they had called for the London Air ambulance and reittarated for me to stay calm. (I must admit, As soon as they walked in the door I had a sigh of relief, and my face must of lit up with delight to see them carrying a gas and air cannister) I had no relfexes in my feet or in my left knee. They stretchered me out and put me into this state of the art air-mattress that compresses air around you and keeps you padded into a position. The drive seemed to go on for what seemed like hours. I could feel a pain in my head getting worse by the second. I was admitted into the resuscitation department *and if anyone has seen the programmes on the tv where a patient is rushed into hospital with 7 doctors and nurses around them...it was EXACTLY like that* I had questions fiering at me from so many directions! I was hooked  up to about 3 different monitors, and i had four cannular outputs put in, and lined up to iv fluids. They pumped my body with paracetamol and morphine followed by the gas and air on a nebulizer. After 6 hours they took me to the MRI scanner and did a full body scan to which i was told I had no breaks. FANTASTIC news. I was so high at this point, talking to the ceiling, talking to the dead and alsorts. But it was not a cannibis high.... no where like that, no where near the nice relief you get from a joint. It was full of chemicals and I could tell. Later on that day, the consultant came back to me and told me that although I had no breaks, he had concerns about the density of my bones. And that they were thinning considerately. They soon discharged me with nurses to come in twice a day. Since being home i see the nurse twice a day and she pumps me with some sort of concoction. I'm also about 12 tramadol a day along with morphine and other drugs. Whilst i'm awaiting a full bone density scan, an appointment with the pain control team and to see the ortho surgeon, I am struggling considerably. I'm 19, and My 85 year old nan walks faster then me. I struggle to get up and down the stairs, and I can't even get in my bath. In the house I walk around and hold on to objects to sturdy my balance, but when i leave the house i rely on crutches to walk with. Painwise, I have this constant ache. The pills dont touch it. I'm not eating because the morphine makes me sick. And i spend most of the day dozing in and out of a trance because of the toxicity of all the drugs. My point, and I know i've blabbered for quite some time to actually make this point, but how can doctors, the government or whatever, let me live like this? How can they pump my body with all these toxic pills with all harmful chemicals in. How can they allow that? When there is something perfectly natural that relieves my symptons and 100% improves my mobility. The way i see it is cannibis is pro life. It gave me a life, it gave me quality of life. I could lead as much as a normal life as i could given the circumstances. Yes it was illegal, but it was natural and it felt normal. Instead now, my life at the age of 19 is still on hold. I haven't worked in over 9 months now, and i hardly see my friends. I have now lost nearly a stone and a half in just under 4 weeks because of the drugs, and doctors say if i continue to drop more weight i will have to see a dietician. Most nights I lay awake til about 5 in the morning because the pills keep me awake. I have a big gap in my life now, where my ex used to be. He was a big and important part of my life, and he would always look after me, making sure i got to all of my appointments, and in the end he improved my condition by supplying me with weed. So even though we have split, I have alot to thank him for. I don't know how long it will take for me to get better but i'm greatful to him and the weed for the quality of life it gave me all be it for just 4 months.

I'd say we progressed slowly, stroking, masturbating, oral and a couple of weeks ago, actual intercourse.\n\n**Good news**: We're both great at communicating, very attracted to each other physically, both take initiative and enjoy pleasing each other. There's never been any physical or mental discomfort, my original worries (will getting the condom on be easy? I'm uncircumcised - does my foreskin retract enough? the head's sensitive, will it hurt? etc. etc.) were unfounded. Physically - it's just great. Both of us pick up cues on what the other likes and remember them - we've both been using our fingers and mouths every way we can, and it works. Every time we're in bed, she comes 4-5 times and she absolutely drives me crazy too. I've seen her go into giggling fits and get overwhelmed with tears when I just hold her while she unwinds. We've never got out of bed dissatisfied.\n\n**Bad news**: I orgasm too soon. The first time we tried intercourse, I actually orgasmed just when I was about to push inside. Ego took a serious beating, but next day was better - I actually managed to get in, but about 10 seconds later I was done. I researched in this subreddit, followed Maxxters' links, etc. I realized maybe it takes some getting used to, and I'm uncircumcised - so maybe the head needs to get used to the extra stimulation, etc.\nSo we're doing it again, and the next few times too I'd come too soon. It's getting better but only marginally, I'm lasting maybe 15-20 seconds now. I know sex isn't over just because I orgasmed - and we're usually at it after I orgasm, and I very happily use my fingers, go down on her, make sure she's satisfied.\n\n**What I've tried**: Masturbating earlier, let her go down on me first,  deep breaths etc. Masturbating earlier or her going down on me first doesn't seem to help - I'm usually good to go again pretty soon and the improvement isn't great. Staying calm and not actively thinking about orgasming does help, but only so much. I last longer with blowjobs, but I've noticed when she focuses on the head (licking the tip etc.) that does stimulate me a lot more.\n\nI'm open to any ideas at all. I'm doing kegels, but any estimate on when it starts getting better? Or is this just something that one needs to practice more of?

We had been dating for a little over three months, and everything just seemed to be going perfectly. As short of a time that three months is, we never fought and really just spent most of it enjoying each other's company. Until last night.\n\nI've bent over backwards for this guy, doing so much out of thought and consideration for him. When he needed someone to accompany him to an acquaintance's shotgun wedding, I went. When his fancy internship fell through, I spent hours googling for a new one until I eventually found one. When he was having a bad day, I went out of my way to make it better. When he had a long day at his internship, I was sure to have his favorite dinner ready for him when he came to visit.\n\nOur relationship was semi-long distance.

The first strange occurrence happened within the first week or so, about eight years ago. We were all in our trailer (we were building the house at the time, it was previously vacant property) and I was getting ready for bed. I was just about to close the blinds by my bed, when as i'm looking outside, a light sweeps and crosses the adjacent hill. Like someone was walking up to it with a really bright flash light. I told everyone what I saw so everyone else went to the window, and it happened again, for everyone to see. We were creeped the hell out now. We all go outside to look and see if there is a person out there (we thought maybe the neighbor who lived half a mile away had walked over or something) no one. Also, it's important to note that there was fresh snow on the ground, about a foot deep, and there was no footprints of any kind. We tried to explain it as cars from the road (thats almost a quarter mile away) helicopters etc. But nothing added up. So we decided to let it go as something we just couldn't explain, and didn't dwell to long on it. \n\nLater (I don't remember when as this was about 8 years ago, a few months after the other occurrence) me and my brother we walking up our driveway, when suddenly a bright flash of light filled the ground, (where we were looking) I asked my brother if he saw it, and he said he had. It was a clear evening, and the sun had gone down over the mountains, an there was no inclement whether anywhere in sight. We brushed it off and kept going. \n\nThings become a bit jumbled in my memory, but only so far as to the timeline of the events, but not the events themselves. \n\nAnother occasion, I was walking up the driveway at dusk, at about the same spot as the flash of light, I hear a very deep growl. Almost like a animal/human, but nothing discernibly came from it, just sound. I looked around and didn't see anything or anyone (remember I'm 20 miles from the nearest payphone, 8 miles from the nearest paved road.) It was utterly quiet around me. I felt bothered and walked faster, and I now avoid being outside at night here. \n\nOne particular occasion annoyed the shit out of me. My car key, just one key, not a key chain, disappeared. I always ritualistically put it on my desk when I get home, well, one morning it was just gone. I mean absolutely gone, I felt like I was going crazy (and this isn;t the first time I've had things go missing, I never got my retainers back that also went missing) After looking everywhere, EVERYWHERE, i gave up. We had suspected that something had taken them, but what could we do? Well, one night my mom was laying awake in bed, she said she felt something cover her. As though it was a blanket or something. She told me she talked to it, told it that if it meant no harm it should return the key. No one, even her expected a response. The next morning, my mom cleaned her closet out, specifically cleaned the dresser off, well, no key was there. Jump forward about 10 hours when we all arrived home. She went to her closet like always, to change her clothes, and there, onto of her dresser, was my car key. How it got there while everyone was gone, i have only guesses. \n\nAs a general rule here, electronics are constantly going haywire. Our water pump would stop working randomly, or not so randomly for example when my dad would go to take a bath, the pump would stop working, but at no other time did it do that. Random luck? Possibly I guess, but unlikely in conjunction with everything else. Smoke alarms with perfectly good batteries would go off, being set off by one room or another. Our washer electric parts have all gone out six times. \n\nMany things happen such as a picture falling off the wall, we checked the nail and cable, both secure, had no reason to fall. Bottle cap thrown on the floor (shoved maybe?) Constant footsteps in the house at night, when no one is up. Talking, light whispers, normal talking etc. I've actually laid in my bed and heard a man and woman talking in our downstairs. Our downstairs is a daylight basement, that no one in my family EVER uses at night, and barely in the day. It's unfinished and mostly a storage area. I often feel watched from right outside my window, to the point where I get up and pull the curtains closed. Heavy banging on the iron man pillars downstairs, that literally can be felt in bed. The list goes on and on. We constantly have things disappear, my brothers knives, my moms recipes, my shit. \n\nI was actually laying in bed one night, quite awake, when I heard something whisper my name into my ear. Needless to say I got up and put a movie on, just so I could cast aside any noises from that point forward, as the movie. \n\nOne very strange night, the night the earthquake in haiti struck, my mom was in her room, awake in bed. My girlfriend at the time had stayed over, and being in an unfinished house, my mom didn't have her door on yet, but she had hung a sheet in the doorway fro privacy, because we had company (my gf) anyways, that night my mom woke up to sobbing noises, a man sobbing and wailing. She said she had never heard anyone so grief stricken, just an absolute sadness. A deep sobbing, as if someone had just loss someone close to them. My mother actually thought at the time it was my brother, perhaps his dog had died, she said that she couldn't think of anything that would make him that upset. She got up, pulled the sheet back to step out, and as soon as she did, the noise stopped. That same night, as a slept next to my GF i woke up, and felt like something was looking at me from my open doorway. I rolled over and buried my face into my sleeping GF shoulder, and went back to sleep. \n\nWe have cats and on one occasion, about 9 months ago, we heard the cat (1 of 2)  in the basement hissing, growling, with his hair standing up, then he came flying up the stairs into our great room. later, about 2 days later, the other cat, was sitting on the last landing before the stairs descended into the basement door, he was hissing and growling with his hair standing up, staring into a visibly empty door. What the fuck was it? Again, we can only speculate what it was. \n\nA very recent occurrence, just a week ago, my mom was watching TV and surfing her laptop, and the dogs were all laying around her on the floor. My dad left the room, to go outside, he came back about 5 mins later, and found the door deadbolted.

I&amp;#39;ve heard of cellulite creams but I&amp;#39;m skeptical. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1341168638,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}
