I have a problem, since January the car has been burning oil too fast, ATM has got 70.000km on it more or less, it's a 2010 Citroen C4 mk1 with the 1.4L I4 90hp engine. It didn't ever do that before, we always change the oil every 15.000km and has always passed the inspections correctly, it doesn't dump blue smoke, it isn't driven hard (it's my mom's car) except some launches when wet and some short revbombs but I do that sometimes. I already bought the oil filter and 5w40 oil and I'm waiting Citroen to tell me which PCV valve does it have and I'll change it too because I read that it can be one of the problems.

I'm 29 years old, and started transitioning when I was 27. Emotionally, I want it and I'm glad I'm making progress, but I also want to reassure myself I'm making the right choice. Especially since I know recovery will be incredibly difficult.\n\nI set the surgery date because I am not entirely comfortable with my dick, and am at a place in my life I can afford it and can choose a surgeon I trust. However, I'm not deeply genital dysphoric. I don't like seeing it in the shower, and thinking about it can help sort of push me over the limit if I have to vomit (you know how it is when you have the stomach flu and are tired of waiting). But it hasn't stopped me from having a sex life alone and with other people, or made hygiene or getting dressed emotionally trying.\n\nAs a teen, I had a few calming castration fantasies (when I'd feel overwhelmed or angry or whatever, I'd imagine cleanly ripping it off, like it wasn't truly attached) and found the concept of SRS really fascinating when I learned it was a thing. Not in a \"Wow, doctors can do that\" but more in a \"That's great! That'd be so cool to experience, but it's something that isn't for me, like how a private jet would be cool but is useless to want.\"  I didn't see myself as trans or a girl, I just wanted it. Go forward a decade and change, and when another woman mentioned she'd had that surgery in support group, I felt a euphoric bolt of lightning travel my spine, realizing I actually could go for it with only minor life changes. And about six months after that, I got a salaried job with insurance that could pay for SRS.\n\nBefore I came out, I dated women exclusively, and I was in a long term relationship with a cis woman who I comfortably had sex with in a way typical of cis men in straight relationships. It didn't really feel weird until I started transitioning about five years into our relationship, and I realized I felt masculine with her when I used my dick. I broke up with her over stuff unrelated to sex and transition, and started dating men (I'm bi). In my sexual encounters, I'm pretty conditional about it and don't really like positions where it's too visible, moving a lot, or when a guy goes down on me. It's not something that could end the night, and sometimes I'll consent if he really wants it, but there's times I kind of think about something other than what's going on. Probably not full-blown dissociation. I'm not sure if I'd enjoy penetrative sex with a cis woman as I am at this point (I tried topping once with a trans woman, since she asked and I hadn't tried it, and absolutely hated the experience), but even if I did, I'm not sure I'd feel like the most comfortable version of me.\n\nOn my own, I orgasm pretty quickly. I still get erections, which kind of bother me. It especially sucks when I'm feeling myself and thinking of myself in a nice fantasy and have a throbbing reminder of what my real body is like. So a lot of my best fantasies don't really involve any sort of first person version of me at all.\n\nAnd, of course, I'd love to feel more confident in leggings, running shorts, swimsuits, and so on. But that's not a big concern. I'd probably just look into gaffs and experiment with underwear more were that the only thing.\n\nGoogling around, I find accounts from people in a much worse place, who mention having trouble with stuff like showering entirely nude, or with getting their bodies photographed during the surgery consult. I've never felt that level of dysphoria, and appreciate that other people find SRS essential for that reason. And I also accept there's a real chance of complications that can be permanent or require revision surgeries, that I could be not orgasmic (sex isn't a big part of my life), or stuck with something painful or difficult to live with. To me, they feel like risks I'd hate to be on the wrong side of, but risks worth taking.\n\nDo I sound like I know what I'm doing?

While she ran into her room crying, calling my Dad to pit him against me yet again, I threw out my last fuck, packed my shit, and went cross state, confident that she had the cops on my tail. I had no car, no money, no employment history (just turned 16), and no contacts. I spent the next few weeks picking up cans and cashing them in, and then I got a bike for $25 from a pawn shop, and a towel from from goodwill for $3. I got food from the local food pantry, only taking what I could carry in my backpack, and eating only once per day to conserve groceries. Now that I had a bike, i ensure i kept my job. The bike would allow me to get far enough from the job site, to keep them from knowing I was homeless, while allowing me to get to work on time after bathing in the lake (10 miles from work). After a few paychecks, I rented a trailer from these old folk for $500 \/mo (apartments wouldn't take my money cuz I wasn't 18 yet). Few more paychecks, I got myself a truck. Few more paychecks, I'm 18, and I decide to pay my family a visit.\n\nI got there, my father was happy to see me (thought i was dead), &amp; my step mother, for the first time in my life, actually showed me respect. She looked at me when I spoke to her, she took the bitch outa her voice when she talked to me, and she no longer tried to pit my Dad against me. For the first time ever, she was chill.\n\nAll this, with anger as my main energy. I pursued life aggressively, I dominated every aspect of my life, regardless of my position on the dominance hierarchy, and I was fearless. Animals that ravaged my camp became my dinner, the people who once talked shit about me sleeping under the park pavilion now lower their heads when they see me.\n\nDon't suppress your anger.

Really just four years of young slutty fun.\n2. **Down On My Luck:** I've had a problem keeping a job. Reports of lewdness and inappropriate work attire keep getting me fired. So, I figured that I'd apply to work a strip club!\n3. **Working For a Powerful Man:** For this one I would be hired by you, a rich an powerful man (or woman if you prefer) as like a maid or secretary or something like that. My duties would steadily evolve into taking care of more than just your home or office.\n4. **Party Girl Gets Raped:** This one could get a little darker. I'm looking to play out the aftermath of a slutty party girl getting raped after drinking too much at a party. This could be in a college setting and I'd like to explore the aftermath of this. Like will I want more? Will it awaken a non-con kink in me and make me try to bait guys?\n5. **Maledom World:** Another favorite setting of mine is a maledom setting where all women are property, owned by their fathers when they're born and eventually sold off. Of course for any ladies interested in this we could do it as a futadom world instead...\n6. **Gym Showers:** All the shower stalls in the girls locker were full and I didn't remember seeing any guys around while I was working out, so I decide to just use the guys' locker room real quick. What happens when you come in? Are you able to seduce me? Or will you just take me and make me your gym slut?\n7. **Bimbofication:** I'd love to set up a long term bimbofication prompt including hypnosis and transformation elements with anyone who's interested.\n8. **Nude Beach:** I'd like to set something up where we meet on a nude beach and it eventually leads to sexy adventures between us and anyone else that we meet. \n9. **Celebrity Goes Slutty:** For this one I'd be playing a celebrity of your choice who's fallen on hard times. She's been out of luck in finding work and is resulting to looking for a job at either a strip club or getting into the porn industry. \n10. **Are You Seriously Going Out in That?** ...Is what you asked me as I stood in our living room making the last touch ups to my makeup. \"Don't tell me you're jealous.\" I say as I shake my ass a bit at you. I was wearing a tight black dress that hugged my round ass and perky 36 D tits.

More realistically I can pass 5.2* - 5.3* at the maximum, but I cannot hold a combo for shit on maps as low as 3.5. I don't know what it is but something always happens every time I try a map. It's always one miss in the VERY MIDDLE or near the middle of a map so I end up losing virtually all possible pp because it's the worst place to miss notes. Even on low difficulty maps I physically cannot get a high combo and I have no clue why. Half the time it's a stupid case where I'm 2 pixels off on a slider and I break. I always can manage a decent accuracy. I mean, on many maps in the 4 - 4.5* range I can get 95% or higher almost guaranteed, but I always mess up on something. \n\nAlso I get very frustrated when maps don't have consistency and that causes me to screw up. For example when the creator doubles the slider velocity suddenly so two sliders look the same, but one is twice as fast. Or stacked notes having seemingly random delays, with 1\/1 stacks, 1\/2 stacks and 1\/4 stacks intertwined without any distinction.\n\nIs there any advice to this?

I've tried short maps, long maps, not retrying maps, practicing easy maps, practicing hard maps, watching replays. I don't understand why I cannot get to the point of holding a combo. It's not like my hand is shaking during play, or I have a terrible grip on my pen.\n\nTL;DR I would appreciate tips on how to get a good combo on maps. I always mess up at least once, usually in the middle or near the middle of the map. I've had this issue for months and it's extremely frustrating for me because I can have an accuracy of 97 or 98% or higher and still get 0 pp because I missed one or two notes.\n\nhttps:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/6981834\n\nThank you!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"osugame","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3lm","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/osugame","subreddit_subscribers":70423,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Unable to hold a good combo on most maps for months now, even 1.5 stars below my maximum","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/osugame\/comments\/93k18f\/unable_to_hold_a_good_combo_on_most_maps_for\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I also want to have self autonomy and control of my own self and perceptions.  Navigating these waters is a mental web that seems impossible to untangle.\n\nSome context:. Male, very unstable childhood, emotionally abusive mom, internalized homophobia, etc.  My first relationship was in high school, with a girl, and looking back, I was emotionally abusive I'm pretty sure.  Pretty sure I used her to regulate my emotions at times.  I was dealing with a lot regarding my sexuality and felt controlled by her if she tried to \"tempt\" me (did I mention I was also heavily indoctrinated religiously?).  She wasn't very vulnerable, it just wasn't right and I called it off because I knew it was unhealthy.  We had a deep connection, nevertheless, and recently became really good friends again this past year which makes me so happy.\n\nAfter this split, I gradually entered a highly authoritarian, spiritualized, textbook cult...but without any obvious nefarious elements.  Something about this environment seemed to really open up what I think now was a traumatic childhood, and the cult itself was traumatizing for me.  I was very emotionally dysregulated...I would lean on them a lot to make sense of things and they would encourage it most of the time.  After eight years I think they were tired of my neediness.  There was something wrong with me that God wasn't fixing.  At the same time, they were dropping hints of this being existential in nature.  Maybe I wasn't one of them.  Maybe God was not loving me or willing to change me.  At the end, I had shared a distressing story, like expressing stuff, and I was shunned and shamed.\n\nI was told that I never belonged (despite all the hundreds and hundreds of interaxtions where I very much was speaking the same voice), that I was Antichrist, that I struggled because God wasn't giving me faith, that I was trying to spiritually murder them, that I was pretending the entire time, and that I was sacrificed by God for them.  I believed everything, because I trusted them more than myself.  It seemed to always be that I couldn't really see things correctly, that I was blind to something they weren't, and that I was more bad than I realized.\n\nOver eight years, I had maybe five incidents where I had a very brief lashing out in response to something they said or did.  I didn't feel much anger then, just paralyzing confusion.  This wasn't a situation where I was constantly questioning them or stirring up trouble, or being rageful.  I was just very dependant and they probably didn't know what was wrong with me.  Nevertheless, their shunning and shaming left me with the belief that the Creator of the universe didn't really love me, that he had formed me in the womb to become some kind of persecutor.  Through all of that, though, I looked up to them, I was so scared of being a burden, I was agreeable, I thanked them a lot, I was pretty submissive.\n\nOut of the cult, I began to learn a lot about cults and group psychology, the construction of the Bible, etc. and realized that it was a cult, a psychological phenomenon. That the Christ story is echoed in all kinds of mythology and that it was profound, but that tribalism was *not* profound.  We believed we were the only people in the entire world that knew the Truth...and that if there were others, we just hadn't met them yet.  \n\nI also had my first boyfriend of sorts.  I saw that neediness come back into play and it made me feel so guilty that I had a mental breakdownb(personally, not with him) and he said we should create some distance because he felt his presence was harming me.  Inside I knew it wasn't going to work after 4 months of dating because I struggled so much internally.  \n\nI really thought we were deeply connected, and that we'd always have a connection no matter what, we would always have the same kindness towards each other.  But I texted him hi one day three months later and he said to not contact him and that he was with an amazing person.  So I didn't.  His words felt intentionally hurtful, which mystified me...I thought we would always at least retain a kindness towards each other.\n\nThen three months later he sends me a regretful love song with no explanation.  I felt so happy to hear from him that I indulged...three songs later between us there was a brief text interaction and then he dropped off the map with no explanation of why he had contacted me (especially if I wasn't supposed to contact him).  Three weeks later he does the same exact thing and.....I indulged again (I was not in a good place at this time)....then he just dropped off again.  And then things changed.\n\nI asked him why he was doing that.  He said that he still sees me as a great friend and likes sharing music with me.  I pointed out that they were all romantic, and he said that he's just the lovey dovey type and didn't mean anything by it.  I still had \"feelings\" for him, so this was all disorienting and I didn't accept that as a good answer.  This was like the first time I was really asserting myself.  Somehow it got pushed back on me.\n\nA month later there was a devastating flood in his city and I was terrified about it all and reached out to him.  He gave zero response.\nThis was the most hurtful thing, and it paralyzed me for a few days.\n\nA month later, I contacted him asking what had happened with the flood ordeal and he said he didn't respond because he didn't want to interfere with me.  He was always displaying this cassanova demeanor, almost guru-like.  He was always wise and could not make mistakes.  But he was always so loving in the way he worded it.  He would tell me things like I was a beautiful soul, etc.\n\nThen like six months passed and he randomly emailed me saying how beautiful I was, that he was happy I still hadn't lost my connection to him (replying to an email I had sent a year prior).  I knew it was wrong\/weird and I didn't indulge it.  \n\nSomething about that experience stayed in my mind, like it had disturbed something in my core, that whole experience....as time had gone by, I became much more accepting of my sexuality and tried dating again.  With this experience I seek your perspective.  Having the previous dating experience lodged somewhere in my being, I wonder if I overreacted or actually made a perceptive move.  I never got to see this guy after years and years for proof of my intuitions, thus it has been a major affliction of doubt and guilt in the aftermath.\n\nWith this person I noticed early on that I wasn't using him to regulate emotions, wasn't needy, etc.  I was more aware of that, was in trauma therapy, etc.  I had so much more confidence and sense of self.  But in the aftermath of the experience I have been devastated, feeling I can't trust myself....and if I can, that it's horribly disorienting that this kind of thing keeps coming into my life, like I am unconsciously inviting it.\n\nIf you were dating someone and they did\/said the following, would you think it strange\/uncomfortable?  Also, did my sudden split towards him make you think of an abusive person?\n\n1.  Wanting to know every last detail about me, super interested in everything about me, and initiating texting like twelve times a day. (I was very responsive and flattered, albeit self consciously).  For some reason was always very encouraging of sharing everything with him, to never feel like I need to hold back.  Despite the intense interest bestowed upon me, he was mostly very vague about his feelings towards me, whereas I shared my feelings a few times.\n\n2.  When I set a boundary to not stay in such constant contact (my work was suffering and I felt this growing dependency) they thought I was losing interest, gushed all their feelings for me, disagreed that it was necessary though \"understood\" (\"If things are able to work out with us without constant contact then fucking awesome and yay!\"), didn't change constant contact at all but continued as usual the next morning, planning our next date a week in advance.  I was responsive and just got swept away again.  (But I also didn't give him a week or so to really see if he was in fact ignoring me)\n\n3.  When I brought up the weirdness surrounding the #2 very gently the next day....and what I perceive to be excessive fawning from #1, they became very defensive saying, \"I'm not some weak, fragile being\", \"I can love but I can cut a bitch out\", \"I don't build my being on you\".  Maybe his intense fawning wasn't that big a deal and I made it one?\n\n4.  Contradictory about describing self and past.  Disorienting for me. (\"My intense interest  towards people in the past can come off as obssession and I don't want that to be misunderstood\" vs. \"My lone wolf nature in the past has made people think I'm not interested, so I'm especially mindful of this.\")\n\n5.  After #3, suddenly acts like they didn't see us as dating but just \"fucking around\".   Questions my affections despite the fact that I had told him a few times that I really liked him, looked so much forward to seeing him every week, was always attentive to his contact.  That same night he implies he wants to move in together in the future literally the same day he says he just sees us as \"fucking around.\".  (I mean, I would too if things developed and I decided I wanted to be in a relationship.  I was very serious about dating for the purpose of finding a long term partner.)\n\nEverything was going pretty great until #2...and after #5, I brought up my concerns about how it seemed he was manipulating me...that his communication confused me.  After I said we should give it some time and thought, within three hours he said something strange like, \"Quit analyzing me, we agree that we should move on from the honeymoon phase and into something substantial.\"  I certainly never used those words or agreed that things were moving that way.  I had simply expressed that I was serious about finding a partner, and that an infatuation phase is temporary.\n\n It seemed to get worse, and I completely broke and felt all this anger inside of me (which I'm not used to feeling) and I got over reactionary and told him that he didn't really care about me....painted him as a deceptive, manipulative person.  He didn't back down but kept maneuvering to keep me in his life, seemingly unaware of how any of the above was questionable.  Was I just making something out of nothing, projecting something, or intuiting something unsafe?\n\nHe asked me to think honestly of why I was reacting this way, once saying he felt he was triggering me....and I really thought hard about it and I couldn't think of some ulterior motive.  I felt scared and betrayed.\n\nAs I was cutting things off, he told me all these things that I still can't get out of my head four months later:\n\n\"You don't seem to be led by love\"\n\n\"Love gives one strength\" (implying I was overreacting from apparently bad experiences in the past.  In the past he said a couple times how he admired my strength for moving on from a difficult experience)\n\n\"Love makes someone vulnerable\" (implying that by cutting it off I was being invulnerable)\n\n\"Maybe the universe has something else planned for us.\"\n\n\"You can be mean and blind\". (never expressed before that I was mean and blind)\n\n\"You aren't the only one who has suffering\" (I rarely shared suffering with him)\n\n\"You should embrace experiences while you're still young and able to.\" (...........I'm 33?  What?)\n\n\"You have learned a lot, but you still don't know shit.\" (Previously had said how frighteningly perceptive I was)\n\nEtc.  He had never said things like this before, but only after I had challenged him.  After I had said it was over.  He told me he felt I was attacking his character, maybe he said all these things out of hurt.\n\nA week later I felt terrible for how I had painted him as a manipulative person (however, I never went for his vulnerabilities...I accused more broadly)....I was scared I had abused him in some way or influenced him in a negative way...that, perhaps it was just insecurities or something, but not a real issue...and I apologized.  I had no interest in pursuing him any further.  He first said he \"of course\" forgave me, and then it devolved into how much I hurt him and that I was just apologizing to remove guilt so I could move on.  He also threw in a doubting I ever had feelings for him again, as the icing on top.\n\nBefore all of this, I didnt see any issues besides his hyper focus on me.  I had been struggling some to make sense of my feelings at times, but I think this was more related to an anxiety.  I had about three instances over 6 weeks where I reached out to him in a mental funk, needing support.  His advice was always spot on and encouraging.\n\nFor four months this whole experience has consumed my mind and entire being.  I've felt so much guilt and shame and confusion.  I can't seem to decide if I did the right thing, which things I did right, this feeling of needing to atone to him, that he is a better and more advanced person than I will ever be, that I'm a crazy person, that I ruined something.  I feel like he could take what unfolded and easily say I was a toxic person for having become so hypervigilant against him at the end.\n\nI am still in therapy, but my trauma specialist refused to talk about the incident (different story.). I know that I have healing to be done, and I am actively engaged with it, on a neurological level.  Five months ago I did not use the words trauma or abuse to reference any of my life.  This stuff has all been a revelation to me and I'm merely looking for perspective, I suppose. \n\nThank you to anyone who took the time to read this.

A little back story: I am 27 years old and I have a seven year old daughter which I had in a previous relationship from high school. My daughters father and I were very young and it didn\u2019t work out. He sees her every other weekend and that has worked good with having time to spend my boyfriend among other things. I am a very busy person I work full time and go to school nights along with having a child so it is very difficult for me to have free time so when I do it is kind of a big deal for me. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been dating for almost two years, he is 28 and still lives at home with his mom and most of the time is pretty dependent on her. My problem is in the beginning when we first started dating it seemed perfect like a fairytale, he always wanted to be with me, every time I was free he made time. It just seemed perfect. All of a sudden I am noticing a change and it makes hard to describe it but it seems like I am always the one asking him to hang out and on multiple occasions he said he is too tired or he needs rest. Of the few times that he has initiated and made a point to hang out with me I\u2019ve never said no. We always talk about how we want to live together but it never moves forward. He doesn\u2019t make that much but that\u2019s never been an issue for me. Now when we do hang out and I don\u2019t have my daughter I am just always assuming he would want to spend the night with me which in the beginning he wouldn\u2019t even think twice. Now we will always be intimate and then shortly after he will say he really wants to rest or something. When I bring it up he just says he has anxiety and he just wants to sleep. A side note is that I am a very sexual person as in I\u2019m always horny and most of the time I\u2019m down for anything at any time. I will please him if thats what he wants and I don\u2019t get upset about that because that turns me on too and I also enjoy doing it for him because I love him. As of lately though I feel like I\u2019m the only one giving this effort into this relationship and getting nothing in return. When he says no to hanging out or even for a \u201cquickie\u201d I will say sometimes l, it really just hurts my self esteem because its like he\u2019s denying me and I just want to be with him. I don\u2019t know if this makes sense or if I\u2019m just ranting but I need some advice on how to address this with him so he understands where I am coming from. How do I bring this up to him? Am I crazy or being too much to think this ? \n\nTL;DR: my boyfriend doesn\u2019t spend time with me and I need help figuring out how to bring this up or if anyone else has had this issue","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationship_advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0cn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/relationship_advice","subreddit_subscribers":783151,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My[27F] boyfriend[28M] doesn't spend as much time with me as I would like","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/93k3ua\/my27f_boyfriend28m_doesnt_spend_as_much_time_with\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Dumb people, that's who. If you ask someone \"Hey, you want to go to the museum?\" and they decline, you're natural instinct is to follow up with \"Oh, so you're dumb?\" And then they'll get mad because dumb people can't debate. And that's, by the way, the end of the debate. Anyway, I didn't go in. I'm not into museums.\n\nCancer\n\nIf you have cancer, South Lake Union has you covered BIG TIME. In fact, people from all over the globe fly to Seattle to get treated here. The Cancer Alliance is a group of Fred Hutch, UW, and Children's. And they are excellent. Point is: don't get cancer in Kent. \n\nSmoking\n\nAs it were, I was near the Cancer Alliance and let me tell you: even a dumbass like me who doesn't go to the museum given the chance knows enough not to smoke anywhere fucking near the cancer buildings. But in the back of my head there was a demon thinking \"What if I just lit up in this hospital?\" I mean, can you imagine? I think we'd finally have proof of the afterlife, because angels would fly down from heaven and personally drag me to hell. But the thought entered my mind. Like: what if I voted for Dino Rossi? Anyway, I had to walk down to this parking lot by Chandler's Cove to smoke and even then I could hear demons clawing underneath the pavement. \n\nAmazon\n\nOf course, Amazon is down here. I don't exactly know where, though. At one time I did. But then they built about five buildings in front of that building and I no longer can figure out where it is. Funny thing about Amazon being down there: my theory is Amazon is a cancer on the city and they moved to Seattle because (see Cancer paragraph).\n\nSpecialtys\n\nProbably take a lot of guff for this but: eh. Here's the deal: I ordered stupid. The ham sandwich (yes, ham, none of this fucking capmycola crap) came all fucked up with potato bread and no cheese. So, I did my own sandwich art and added cheese and got the sourdough and sesame bread. Haters be like \"But you fucked up the menu item\" and to them I say \"But it was fucked up from the get go\". Anyway, it wasn't bad. But it was like something your grandma who lives in Shelton would make: fucked up potato bread aplenty. She'd probably only have a bottle of Slice from 1986 too. BECAUSE SHE'S FUCKING ON A BUDGET, BITCH!\n\nAmazon fire guy\n\nI sat next to this dude from Amazon at Specialty's talking to this other dude and he was all about the firing. Like being fired helped you. Like trial by fire. Like eating fire. Like fire come walk with me. Anyway, I realized how you know when someone at Amazon has gone full Kool Aid: they talk about how you have to love your job or you won't have a good time at Amazon. Like that's news: you either like your job or you don't. These Amazon folks have so many ways of explaining their job sucks shit, but they enjoy eating it. It's funny to me. But then again, I'm the guy who thought about lighting up in a cancer research center.\n\nSlut\n\nDo they still call the trolley down there the SLUT? South Lake Union Transit or something? Well, I pulled out of the cancer place and it was blocking an entire intersection. I go \"What a slut!\" And then laughed. But seriously: what is the use of that thing? Everyone's biking and walking and trying to be all non smoking and no eating pizza - who are the lazy asses riding the SLUT? \n\nHomeless\n\nI could be VERY wrong, but I notice every time I'm in South Lake Union: no homeless. You think Bezos has a cadre of people out there moving them south to the city center? Like maybe that's why he's not bothered by what his awful company has wrought???? Again, remember I almost lit up in....\n\nFinding another fat guy\n\nLet me tell you something you skinny people don't know - and I know because I was once one of you: there is nothing better than seeing another fat guy in a health conscious city. It's far from being a black guy in Seattle and seeing another black guy - but it's gotta be somewhere on the spectrum. Also, it's a little worse because we're both too fat to really have each other's back. But it is reassuring. Also, he might know where the McDonald's is. \n\nAllen institute\n\nI could google this, but I prefer to think of it as a whole institute of technicians working on turning Paul Allen into Jimi Hendrix. Think about it: if you had all the money in the world (he virtually does) and you could do anything and you were Paul Allen... Can you imagine this elderly fat guy floating in a bag of yogurt and he's got Jimi Hendrix's head?\n\nBuca\n\nPhil Hartman's last meal was at one of these. I saw an ambulance outside the one in South Lake once. I ate there a couple times. It's fun. Kindov. I guess. Girls like it. Do they still call women girls these days? *That was just like my elderly person impression of scattered thought. Plus I'm 73.\n\nBoats\n\nFucking BOATS! I don't get it. They tell you to never own a boat, just know people that have a boat. But are they really that much fun? Hey, I'm on the water. Hey, I'm sea sick. Hey, I can't use any of the toilets. Hey, I just got decapitated by a tow rope. That's my thinking on boats. \n\nConstruction\n\nI think Bezos just keeps building to keep moving the headquarters' location to dodge taxes.\n\nMercer\n\nMercer was a mess in 92. Mercer is still a fucking mess. But now there's a continent more people. I've said it before in the evilist voice I have: Enjoy your city. I picked that up after I moved out in 2007. Nothing makes me happier than explaining to someone who lives downtown how shitty the place is to live in and then watch them weep in front of me while I flick ash from my cigarette at them and laugh on into the night. HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!\n\nBikes\n\nDon't know why, but I don't like 'em. I am for everything they do: relieve traffic, provide exercise, are emission free, etc. I still hate bikes and bikers. It's a problem. A serious problem that I can't explain.

I'm 24. I have a GED, dropped out of college twice. I currently sell weed(Sometimes other substances but I'm trying to cut back on dealing them) and work a part time job to support myself but I've dropped multiple jobs due to drug dealing, I've always had a problem with authority. I've always thought \"Why do I need this job when I make more than enough selling drugs?\" and eventually quit. I've never held a job more than 8 months. I've had about 10-12 jobs and I can't use any of them as a reference because I just leave and don't come back. I'm perfectly content with sitting inside and doing nothing but meeting a few people to make some quick cash. I don't even really spend money besides on eating out, electronics, and bills. \n\nRight now I don't even own a car because mine broke down and I didn't want to spend money replacing it as I don't really need to but that wouldn't matter anyways because my license is suspended due to not having insurance. I need an SR-22, can't have that without insurance.\n\nOh, and not to mention my criminal record. I have 5 misdemeanors. No felonies, but that's the best thing about this whole story, no felonies. Sad isn't it? I think it's sad because eventually, after 3 years of dealing, I'm bound to get caught and catch a felony. Right?\n\nYou want to know WHY dealing drugs will ruin your life? Not because of getting caught or robbed(Neither have happened YET) but because your work ethic goes right in the trash. The moment you hand someone a bag and get your weeks paycheck right then and there, you realize how bullshit working is. You not only doubled or tripled your income but you also gained back TIME. Instead of working 25-35 hours a week, you can do whatever you want, whenever you want. \n\nLet me tell you about my day last Tuesday. I woke up at 11AM, smoked a little weed, went and grabbed McDonalds breakfast, went and played 18 holes of golf, got Chinese takeout, then came home and played Xbox all night without a care in the world. The best part is that I could do this just about every single day because I have the money and time.\n\nSounds great, right? Wrong. Try doing that for a year straight and go back to working a shit job for no money. It fucking sucks. It's impossible to leave unless you're better your life through getting a college degree or trade school. You can't be in the same position you're in right now, deal drugs for 2 years, and then go right back. It's never going to work.\n\nSo here I am, a 24 year old loser. I have money, my own place, my own things, but...I'm a fucking loser who can't keep it up for long.

About a year ago, I discovered lichess.org, and started getting back into it ([my rating on that site is about 1700](https:\/\/lichess.org\/@\/olliecampbell)). A few months back I became a bit obsessed with chess and decided it was time to start actively trying to improve. Since then I've been watching videos, reading books, had a few lessons with a coach etc.\n\nI had always wondered what it would be like playing in a proper tournament, so a few months ago I signed up to play in a FIDE rated tournament at my local chess club. On the whole it was a great experience. I was pretty nervous and bumbling at first, and my expectation was that I'd lose every game. But I actually managed to be vaguely competitive in most of my games and even won a couple.\n\nHere are some things I've learned:\n\n* Openings are completely different in tournament chess. Online it's endless 1. e4 and 1. ... c5. Over the board there's much more variety (which is very challenging at first). I basically have no \"repertoire\", so I've been scrambling to put one together week to week.\n\n* It turns out preparing for specific opponents is really fun! You can find games online for most people, guess which openings they might play and prepare accordingly. It's been a great way to give me things to focus on when studying.\n\n* Going over tournament games is also really fun. Because you're staring at them for 2+ hours, you more or less end up memorising them, and figuring out what you did wrong is super educational.\n\n* You'll get beaten by kids, but you'll get over it\u2014there are a lot of really talented young players out there. When I've lost to kids I've almost felt kind of ... proud of them. I am a dad so I might be projecting here :)\n\nAnyway today I got [my FIDE rating](http:\/\/ratings.fide.com\/card.phtml?event=3238539): 1522 (they only seem to update on the 1st of the month for some reason). Since then I've lost 3 games, so I expect it to be quite a bit lower next month, but still\u2014better than I expected!\n\nThe reason I'm posting this is because for a long time I was really curious how I'd go playing against \"real\" chess players, and now I know. If you're in the same boat I'd totally recommend getting out there and giving it a go, it's been a great experience. Playing over the board is so much more interesting and intense than playing online, and I feel like it's opened up a whole new world of chess for me.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"chess","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhr7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/chess","subreddit_subscribers":100615,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I'm 39.

I am not a fan of any of these, in my courses, the theory behind the techniques were interesting; however, the application is not.

I mean, I remember when I was younger always being fascinated by behavior in relation the criminology and riveted by individuals with mental disorders\/disabilities such as schizophrenia, bipolar, autism, etc. Documentaries on these topics were the only educational thing I could watch without my ADHD flaring up.

Just doing an introductory post - I'm really looking forward to chatting here with y'all!\n\nI've been waiting for about 7 years or so. I'm 30 years old now, and it has been a long wait! I'm glad I waited though - things are much better now than they were 7 years ago in every aspect of my\/our lives.\n\nWe just started TTC a week ago. My period isn't perfectly regular (is anyone's??), it varies between around 24 - 28 days, but I'm expecting it on the 7th. So it's possible that we caught ovulation but I guess there is no real way to know as I'm not temping or anything. I do track my periods on a very basic app, along with various symptoms I notice - mostly just so that I can look back on it. I often think that I feel ovulation pain around the appropriate time but again, I don't really know for sure! If it was ovulation twinges that I felt this month then we started TTC the day after that (the 25th). So I'm not filled with expectations, but I am filled with hope lol. I can't help it! Trying to keep my expectations low and just 'go with the flow'. The 'trying' right now is definitely fun so I hope it stays like that for the duration... or as long as possible.\n\nI'd love 2-4 children. My partner isn't too concerned with the number, but he would like to adopt at least one of them. I'm totally on board with that - I don't know much about the practicalities of adoption right now but there is plenty of time for that one day. We are very lucky (a combination of luck &amp; incredibly hard work) with our finances, albeit only very recently, so it should be possible in that regard.\n\nThe main thing on my mind right now is whether or not we caught the right timing with ovulation this month. Before my mind was thinking \"no way it would happen this month\", who is that lucky?! But now that TTC is Go I can't help but think 'maybe!'. I am really hoping to be pregnant by Christmas. My partner thinks it will happen straight away. If our bodies cooperate then I guess it's probable. The uncertainty of the whole process is the biggest challenge for me!\n\nMy plan this month - if my period is a no-show on the 7th, I'll take a test on the 8th. We're travelling on the 7th so that should be a distraction from either waiting to test, or a bit of disappointment if my period arrives. I wouldn't be surprised if it came a little early though, my body does like to troll me.\n\nAlso, I've had close friends &amp; family go through infertility problems (with varying levels of success after a lot of trying and medical intervention) but I am aiming to keep that at the back of my mind rather than the front during this early time. If there is a problem then there's a problem! And we'll deal with that the best we can if it happens. In the meantime we'll try to enjoy the journey as much as possible &lt;3 \n\nPS. I love the vibe in this sub! I love seeing BFPs as their own posts! And the mix of posters at different stages of the whole thing.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"WTT_graduates","subreddit_id":"t5_3eo5u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/WTT_graduates","subreddit_subscribers":458,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Introducing myself","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WTT_graduates\/comments\/93kbc3\/introducing_myself\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

Its incredibly stupid that people have to be performing all kinds of mental gymnastics to try and make Yhwach not look shafted. Why would any competent game developer, after putting in the effort to get manga characters into the game, thinks its a good idea to not make the strongest character in the series at least the best or second best in his banner? You guys even made an incredibly accurate moveset for him that no doubt took a long time. Why couldn't you make that kind of effort when it came to balancing him? Is it some clever money making scheme to release underwhelming versions of popular characters and then remake them in the future with what their OG versions should have been in the first place? \n\n\nAlso, after seeing Yhwach I'm 99.9% certain that they either don't test all their characters or whoever testing them has no idea what they're doing. No sensible game tester would let this happen. His shield mechanic is completely underpowered. 10 hits is nothing in the face of a Unohana, who he's obviously made to be a counter to. Not to mention it goes away after a while.\n\n\nI understand not every character is going to be OP but why does it always have to be the characters that are *supposed* to be strong who get shafted? In fact why does there need to be a shafted character at all? Are you so incompetent that you can't figure out how to make characters good and balanced without flurry frenzy and poise?\n\n\nI give you your props for making this anniversary the best one so far. You've been incredibly generous and you put a lot of effort into this anniversary. At this point all you need to do is:\n\n1. Learn to balance characters better. If you're not going to give a character any of the big 3 skills, the gimmick you give them needs to make them so good in their niche that people forget they don't have any of those 3 skills.\n\n2. I know it's tradition at this point but here's a fact that may surprise you: *no characters need to be shafted*. Guess what else? *they don't need to be OP either!* If you balance characters properly you just end up having a bunch of great characters that all excel at different niches and that creates options for people. I don't see how this wouldn't affect your revenue positively since I'm pretty damn sure nobody's pulling for shafted characters.\n\nOnce again I appreciate everything klab did this anniversary but please for the love of god learn to balance characters. \n","send_replies":false,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BleachBraveSouls","subreddit_id":"t5_399jv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BleachBraveSouls","subreddit_subscribers":21225,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Hey Klab here's a suggestion..

I had to jog my memory about what happened in Episode 1, but Half Life is just such a great series and the only downside to finishing it was knowing that I'll almost definitely never see HL3 and I want more of it. It did also make me go mess around in Garry's Mod a bit. \n\n **Bioshock Infinite:** so according to Steam, I'm 67 minutes in so I still have a lot to go, but so far so good. I am already in love with this game visually and I am really going to push myself to finish it in August because I hear the story is incredible. \n\n**Crash Bandicoot for Switch:** Such a huge nostalgia trip for me. I played Crash on Playstation 1 so much as a kid and had memories of how hard the mechanics were like spin-jumping and slide-jumping and all the timing that the game required.

So ltl, ftp, on mobile, and sorry if this doesn't fit here for one reason or another.\n\nMy mother, I'm not sure what she is, but I've found that I can relate to a whole bunch of posts here, so I'm assuming it'd be okay for me to drop this here. If not, that's okay, and I'll take it down. My father is never around, so he's easily able to be classified as an enabler, but that...I'm not entirely sure that matters here, but it's out there now. \n\nAnyway, I just wanted somewhere where I feel like my thoughts on respect would be understood, and another post made me think of this.\n\nA user on tumblr once said: \n\"Sometimes people use respect to mean treating someone like a person, and sometimes they use respect to mean treating someone like an authority. \nAnd sometimes people who are used to being treated like an authority say \"if you won't respect me, I won't respect you\" and they mean \"if you won't treat me like an authority I won't treat you like a person\" \nAnd they think they're being fair, and they aren't, and it's not ok.\"\n\n(I'm sharing that because ever since I found it, it's stayed with me and how my parents and I have interacted.)\n\nLong story short, I'm 19 now, I've moved out before, I'm back temporarily for reasons not related to them, and I'm moving back out soon. They did ok of respecting my boundaries, but not the best, and that kind of brings me here.\n\nI'm super stressed, and I know that's not something that can excuse how I act, but I'm hoping people will at least be able to see where I'm coming from, even if you don't agree with it. But because of how I was raised and being essentially given the coping strategy of bottling things up or being punished, I tend to explode. I used to be really bad, getting violent and such, but I've found that swearing helps keep me from yelling and being destructive.\n\nBut I'm female, so it's improper of me to swear, yet my brother, 15, can do it as he wishes. The particular incident that's caused all this was my parents ganging up on me to tell me to respect them. \n\nNow, I'll admit, I'm scared of my father, as he's been violent before for a rather petty reason(he thought I didn't say goodnight to my mother but I actually did, and dragged me from my bed back downstairs to say goodnight to my mother). So I confronted my mother later, and essentially told her that I swear around them to keep myself in check and she brought up the respect thing again, which caused me to flat out say I don't respect her or my father as people.\n\nAnd I think I got through to her because I didn't use examples of her and my father mistreating my brother and I, but of my mother and father mistreating each other. \n\nAnyway, sorry for this jumbled mess, I just wanted to get all these things out to someone, anyone, who would listen and understand. I've recently seen a healthy familial relationship and I'm grieving the fact that I'll never have a mother that I can confide in or anything and issues and stuff make me want to be validated but it's easier to open up to random people rather than those I know. so yeah.\n\nSorry again if this isn't allowed, or is jumbled, or whatever, but thank you for reading this far if you did.

Sorry if some of my questions are stupid :\/ I've looked online but everything assumes I have savings\/income\/a place to live, I need one to get the others so IDk what to do!!   \n\n\n**Situation**: I'm 18 transferring to a university in San Diego this Fall. I've just been kicked out all the sudden by my parents and now have no idea how I'm gonna pay for college or even have a place to stay. I have no job (wasn't allowed to have one) , no money saved up (except $60 pay pal) , no friends\/family. My parents refused to fill out FAFSA though we're pretty poor and would get quite some aid. People said in my situation getting a dependence override is virtually impossible so if my parents aren't providing information I pretty much can't get aid.    \n\n\nSo the two concerns I have are **1-** tuition **2-** living. \n\nI assume that once I get there I have to firstly get whatever job I can get and start saving immediately. But don't jobs usually ask for address? How would I cash the checks since I don't have a bank account?  \n\n\n**1- tuition:** Since I don't have FAFSA I can't take out non-private loans (I've been told to never ever do private loans). So I'd have to just pay out of pocket, through the university's monthly payment plan right? Is this even possible for me, since I have no savings or income? I've called the university but they've just given me very vague information, and told me to go to their office in person but I live in another part of california. Anyone have any ideas about how I could make this work? \n\n**2-  place to stay:** How would I find a place to stay since I don't have any savings (they all ask for \\~3xmonths + deposit + income) ? Is it that I pretty much have to explain my situation to landlords\/roommates and see who trusts me to pay back in a few months or something? What ways can I convince them? I've looked at airbnb and I do see some $10 a night places that I could stay at for like a week, using my paypal money. \n\nAgain I have no clue what I'm doing or how anything works and thus, I'd appreciate anyone who can provide a bit of guidance or advice, or even just support that this is possible lol.

I almost think it would be better to just stop hanging out rather than continue to further develop these feelings when I know I'll have to be leaving her. At the same time, I'm optimistic that we can probably still see each other every couple of months, keep in some contact and see where we're at in a year. She also doesn't seem ready to jump into a relationship and this would give me some time to enjoy exploring a new city.\n\n***TL;DR: I've developed strong feelings for a girl I met a month ago as we've been hanging out regularly but I'm also relocating cities shortly. We're not going to be long distance dating but I'm hoping we can maintain some relationship and see where we're at in a year (when I might have the option to relocate back home). I can't get the fact that I'll be leaving her out of my mind.***","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskMen","subreddit_id":"t5_2s30g","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AskMen","subreddit_subscribers":689215,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"How Do You Cope With Relocating Cities When Into A Girl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskMen\/comments\/93kgpj\/how_do_you_cope_with_relocating_cities_when_into\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I'm 20, a college student (but I'm interning for the summer), fairly fit, and submissive. As a sub, my favorite kinks are tease\/denial, body worship, having rules to follow, and some light humiliation. I'm curious about forced bi or pegging, but I'd first have to be very comfortable with you before we get into that. These two kinks are not necessarily something that I'm super looking for, but if you're into them and want to give them a go I'd be interested. My hard limits are scat and any pain that will leave a lasting mark (like cutting or bruising). I'm very open to trying any new kinks that you'd have in mind, and I will always speak up if whatever is happening is something I'm not comfortable with. Outside of kink I enjoy computers, video games, Netflix, and hanging out with friends. I like to try new things and meet new people, but I can also be pretty shy\/quiet at first.\n\nI'm looking for a domme or mistress who would be interested in having me as a submissive. I'm really open minded to all body types, but preferably you'd be close to my age (preferably in your 20s). I've also always been interested in trans dommes, and I might be interested in trying something. I'd like this to be more than just a purely kinky dynamic, I'd also like to get to know each other outside of kink. It would be nice if we had some mutual interests in every day life.

So please forgive me of trailing off, speed typing, grammar, and such.\n\nNothing has happened now. But I'm just waiting to get some picture of it. ever.\n\nAnyways. I'm here to talk about the 'White thing' I saw when I was around seven.\n\nIt all happened with a nightmare, I can't recall what the dream was, not that it's important. the rest from this point to the encounter isn't important.\n\nMy parents bedroom is set up in a square shape, with around four closets at the time which were all walk in. There is another small open rectangle room connect to my parents room. It's a small cat room, I think we head a exercise bike in there at the time. I'm not to sure. The bed was facing the three closets which were all closed. The other thing is that none of the cats seemed to be in the room at the time. Which tells me that this thing was there. Or that they had been hiding.\n\nBack to me, I was between my mom and dad. My dad is a heavy sleeper and snores, my mom is a somewhat heavy sleeper. I'm a light sleeper. My mom was facing the fourth closet, the one next to one of the two windows. My dad was facing my mom and I.\n\nI remember waking up when my dad started snoring. When I woke up something felt off. I knew someone was staring at me. At first I thought it was my dad or mom, but I knew my mom was facing the closet from seeing the way her body was facing and her hair brushing against my right arm. I knew my dad was sleeping since I looked over at him and his eyes were closed. Then I looked into the dark, I looked for a few minutes, maybe five or four since the clock was on that side of the bed. On that side was the second and third window. The second large window had a curtain which was white. The third window was small and narrow. With no curtain.\n\nI turned over again and then faced my mother. This was when I saw it.\n\nI'm unsure if it was there or my eyes playing a trick. But when I turned I got a very quick glimpse  of it. The thing was tall, of course it was white. The thing seemed to fade away at the knees or hips. It seemed to be hovering just above the bed. It's arms were at it's sides but it didn't seem to have hands, Just stubs. The head was blurry, well it's whole body seemed blurry. I saw no facial features and it had no hair.\n\nI remember quickly ducking my head and when I looked up again it was gone. Now I know this wasn't the curtain to the first window. The thing was at least a foot away from the window and the curtain to that window was parted a little. Not to mention if it was the curtain it should have been a shaded grey. The humanoid was a lighter shade of grey, even in the dark. But the thing that really got to me was that when my mother got up to do whatever \\[She gets up every hour\\] she turned on the lights to the bathroom and the kitchen. I got up after her since I didn't want to be alone and not have someone blocking that area, and just to try and wake up a little.\n\nShe went out to the kitchen and I noticed that one of our cats, at the time our large orange cat named Rudy, was all puffed up and in the corner of the kitchen near the dishwasher. Rudy is a big cat and a lazy one, hardly reacted to anything. He was one of the more relaxed cats we had. But that night he was puffed up and had a angry vibe on him. When my mother tried touching him he hissed at her, bit her hand and then ran off to the table.\n\nI don't think the rest of this night matters. Nothing else happened and the day after this happened that cats were acting, normal. But Rudy was still pissed off. Which was so odd to me. He is a sweet cat, not one to become aggressive.\n\nThat's all I have about that night. Now this brings it to now.\n\nYesterday at twelve I was on my phone, when I was drawn to the window for no reason. As I pulled the curtains back I remember seeing this faintly white-ish thing in the woods. My room is on the second floor, our room has two windows, one facing the drive way and road, the second facing the actual woods. The wood is on a hill, a steep hill. The figure was behind a tree, it seemed to be hiding or trying not to be seen. Just peeking out. When I opened the curtain a bit wider to get a picture it disappeared back behind the tree.\n\nI didn't get the picture but I planned to wait for a bit. But it never came out. I think I fell asleep at some point and woke up in the morning.\n\nNothing has happened now. But I'm just waiting to get some picture of it.\n\nThis might sound odd but I'll update this when ever something happens.\n\nNow a little about me.\n\nI do believe in the supernatural, but not one to just jump to it if something odd happens. I do have a strong imagination, but I am able to tell reality from fantasy. I do have many other stories of the supernatural and I have heard of such, I love the supernatural and have read many stories on the subject.\n\nThat's about it. So, well I'll update when stuff happens.\n\n**UPDATE 1:**\n\nTonight I will post maybe four or six pictures. Each will be of my woods for reference. The first two will be unedited, just a reference of the angel I was at. The second pair will be edited, showing the area it was at. and the last pair will be edited to give a slight reference to what it looked like to me. {This will be, a guess to what it was or looked like to me. i might not do it though.}\n\nI also want to say I never told my parents or sister. Something else that might be important is that my family is christian. So they would shrug it off. Both of my parents and sister aren't superstitious. i also want to say I have to wear glasses now, I got them in around 2015 or 16, i can't remember but this plays a huge part.\n\nIf I wanted to see it closely and any details I would need my glasses, so when I saw it last I would only see a blurry outline. But this is about it for now. i will update later on, and if I can I will possibly post some other things that have happened to me in the past. For now, Have a nice day, and please stay safe.\n\n**UPDATE 2:**\n\nOK sorry for being gone. I was planning on taking the photos yesterday but we ended up going to a fair and then my cousins to stay over night. Now I might have not made this update and waited till I got the photos to explain but something happened at my cousins.\n\nSo I'm going to explain a bit about what had happened. And I guess a little about us since we are characters here.\n\nSo I'll refer myself as North, I'm 5'1 and need glasses to see far away \\[like small words and such so it's not that bad\\], I have brown hair and brown eyes, Some people think my hair is black but it's a dark brown.\n\nMy cousin I'll refer as Hay, She around, 5'3 or 5'7, shes taller then me, she has black hair and brown eyes, she is strong and doesn't really back down from a fight. She's protective of her family.\n\nAnd My younger sister, olive. She's is 5'4 and has black curly hair and brown eyes. She is brave and strong like my cousin.\n\nAnyways, yesterday at the fair it had rained, hard. the rain made us cut our trip to the fair short which lead us to stay overnight at our cousins. Time skip to night.\n\nThis happened around 11:45 and 12:02. We had been talking to each other late in the night and had been discussing family matters. Now my aunts house is odd, it's rectangular shaped and is on top of a storage area, since that is her job. She creates new things from old stuff. The house has two windows in the front and one huge window in the middle of the two. There is two smaller windows on the side of the house towards a old barn and woods blocking off the fields. We were in the living room area, there is no walls for the living room and kitchen, the only walls is the bedroom and computer room and bathroom.\n\nI was on the couch, Hay and olive were on the ground on a mattress.\n\nIn this position were were facing four windows. The long window and huge middle window and two side windows. Outside of the house were two or four flood lights. Now the lights only activated my huge moment.\n\nThe time this happened we were in the dark talking about family matters. We were then changing to another topic when the lights turned on. OK, the lights could have turned on by a animal being outside. However Hay said the lights could only turn on if someone was either jumping, running around, or any wild moments. At first I wasn't really concerned since it could have been an animal outside or her cats.\n\nHowever Hay said her cats were inside the house, Olive said that she had seen something white outside moving around near the vehicles. At the time there were three vehicles outside parked. One was a silver car, the second was another silver car, and the last was a yellow moving truck that my aunt used for her job.\n\nHay and Olive were startled and went over to the smaller windows to look out of it. I went to the tall narrow window and looked outside. i noticed something white near the yellow moving truck. At first I thought it was a animal then remembered that Hay's cats were inside the house. I looked at it some more and noticed it was ducking back behind the truck. It stopped and seemed to hide fully when my cousins came over to also look outside.\n\nThat was when we saw something crouched behind the truck. Olive said it was black and looked like a human.\n\n\"Do you see that?\" Olive at this time was looking at the truck.\n\n\"Yeah why?\" I said confused, OK, I thought it was the iron wire since there was iron wire leaning against the truck.\n\n\"The black blob? It looks like a human crouching.\" Olive at this point had calmed down and was just pointing at it.\n\nAt that point we thought it was just some weirdo hiding and larking around. So we began to panic again. Not knowing why this stranger was here.\n\nThat was till I spotted something white flash for a second. I looked back while Hay and Olive were talking again, this time quietly. I looked and watched for a bit then I retreated back to my area on the couch. Why did I do this? well, I think I just saw another one. But black, that is unless it can shift colors. Which just makes me panic. I stayed up a bit after this but fell asleep.\n\nNothing has happened since then but now I'm a bit paranoid and have been having a hard time thinking straight. So please excuse any errors in this. I might edit this later on and try to make it easier to read. But for now, I have to wait and calm down. But I will get those photos down. But for now, goodbye, and stay safe.\n\n**Update: 3**\n\nSorry for all the updates, well they are close. Anyways, Heres the picture I said I would post. Just to let you know I could only get the one picture in the daytime and from my parents bedroom. So forgive me of the bad quality. It will be posted separately. Just to let you all know I'm on my phone, also that we will be taking a 2 week trip to South Dakota this week but I'll probably post some of my other experiences during that time and any updates if we get any.\n\nThis is it for now, goodbye and stay safe.\n\n    [Small update]\n       I want to say that I cannot get my own trail cam yet. This is explained in my photo post which I can't really link since I'm on mobile. But it should be easy to find.\n\n**Update 4 {Important}**\n\nOK I need to get this off my chest. For the past week my family and I went on a road trip, we went through Minnesota which had nothing happen, south Dakota had nothing happen. But in Wyoming and while we were in Yellowstone. Something happened.\n\nNow I don't want to describe my family to much, and they aren't important here, at least at the moment.\n\nanyways, we were staying in Yellowstone for two days. It was fun actually, the area was nice to see and the mountains were beautiful. But nothing happened during the day time other then one incident, or that I know of. Which I will add on to the end since it wasn't as big or, at least to me. But I'm not sure if it is linked to  this or not.\n\nSo at night. This is where it starts up. In the first hotel, now this hotel was more like a cabin, it was also shaped in a square but it was rounded, think of those houses that have all the rooms linked, you can go into one and come into another room.\n\nNow I'm not going into a lot of detail since this only happened in the area of the beds and the kitchen area. Ok, I'm skipping to the night, the bed was very soft and I knew I wouldn't wake up. Or I thought. I'm not a bed reader here or anything.\n\nI am stalling since I don't want to think of it. I am tearing up so forgive me if I don't go into detail. Now, here the part I am dreading.\n\nAt around five eleven, 5:11 A.M, I woke up. I think from a dream, not a bad one. I know it had to be a good one since I wasn't breathing hard or had a cold sweat, but I remember feeling. off, not dread, just off. It was a feeling of someone looking at me, but I felt safe. I remember it felt safe and it was quiet, the fan was going above the room and the lights were out. Now it was beginning to light up outside. I noticed from the windows in the small kitchen, then I turned over onto my side.\n\nI regret it so much, I then saw the white thing. It look like it had changed, just the face.\n\nNow, it look like it had before, but I could only see it's head, it had a giant blue eye, solid blue eye, ice blue I think? the eye was just, wrong. It seemed sunken in, but it wasn't the worse part, the worse part had to be the holes.\n\nYou know the fear of holes? Small holes, tyrophobia right? well, that was it.\n\nIt had one giant hole, the mouth I think, and smaller holes with, long things coming out. It had to be the things tongues. Even now my stomach is turning at this so I have to stop. It's as disgusting as it sounds.\n\nThen it was gone. I blinked and it was gone. the thing was gone. For the best but worse, I know it had to be under the bed. But my parents woke up and started to move around the cabin. So ism not sure if that was what made it go.\n\nI might clear this up more, but I can't think clearly at the moment. Its just so disgusting and to make this out.\n\nBut I needed to get this off my chest.\n\nnow for the next part which is more tame. this is a short one as well.\n\nNow this happened in the daytime. At around four P.M. We had gone through some mountains to see something else, now in the place we were in had a bridge. We stopped and headed over, it was small and old looking. Might have been a bad idea to cross it. But my mother, father, and sister crossed the bridge. I stayed  on the other side since I'm a paranoid person.\n\nNow I was on the other side of the bridge when I looked up at the sky, the mountains were rigged and one part was over looking us. So anything could see us, So as I looked up I saw a flash of black, the flash moved away quickly and didn't come back out. So I didn't consider it at all, not till I saw the flash again. As I looked I noticed it was slower and a white flash moved away before the black flash did.\n\nThis go time to run over to my family, which were coming back over the bridge.\n\nNow I want to do something in this post before I leave and try and calm myself down again.\n\nThings to know about me,\n\nI am a timid person at times and a huge push over. But I can become aggressive and rather rude if I and pushed to my limit.  I bottle up my emotions and can become violent because of that. I also am looking for a pocket knife at this time, so this might change things in the future, either for the better or worse. Did I mention I live in a religious household? Well I do, but I still know there are things out there that we don't know of. And of the supernatural, so I take things with a pinch of salt. I also lose track of what I am doing with ease so I apologize if that is happening here. And lastly, I have many things wash over me, by that I mean, if you want me to stay silent and give me a look, I will say \"What?\" and well, you get the point.\n\nOh, one last thing. I am terribly forgetful.\n\nNow I will clear this up later on, that is if I don't forget.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Update 5:** 9\/2\/18- Current date\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey it's me again. I wanted to tell you all something odd. Ok this happened just happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was petting one of our outside cats. He's a full black cat  and meows whenever he is being petted, someone coming near us, or even noticing something. He's pretty much a alert for anything, even danger. I'll explain this since it plays a part, he has his normal meow, sounds like a normal cat, the other is a aggressive meow, low pitch and what all cats sound like when mad or scared. Except he does his little high pitch meow at the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I was outside petting the outdoor cat, his name is Sal. As I was petting him he meowed and looked interested in something behind me. His eyes eyes seemed to dart back and forth and his tail began thumping, not hard, but softly on the decks rail. I ended up looking behind me and didn't see anything which is something I guessed would happen. He's pretty much all attention when I go back to pet him. A few seconds later Sal's tail begins to thump harder against the rail. I can tell he's pissed. As his tail thumps he starts making his growl. Then he swipes at my hand. Not cutting it but swiping at it.\n\nHe jumps down and goes around my legs. All friendly again. This was when I grew concerned and confused. I turned around and looked down. Nothing at my feet or that I could see around me. I end up picking Sal up and heading towards the deck stairs to carry him down to the garage before getting the other four cats in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur deck is curled around the right and left side of the house, facing the road and the drive way. So it curls around the house and you can view all areas from the windows. There is a blind spot at the ends of the house. Facing all sides. But the one I was heading towards was facing the drive way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had Sal in my arms as I was walking. He hates being carried but I was petting him. That was till he wiggled out of my arms quickly and darted off. I was watching him then looked up. I noticed something white dart back behind the house. At first I was confused then it clicked. I then ran back inside the house slamming the door behind me and locking it. I wasn't worried about the outdoor cats since they pretty much just roamed where ever they pleased and from what had happened just a bit before that. \n\nThis is why I think it won't hurt the animal. One, Sal could have noticed it, which is why he was so fixated on something, being it. Secondly, he swiped at something behind me, which I think was it. And that if he did, it had been getting closer and closer to me slowly. Sal must have scared it off when it did swipe at me. Causing it to move back quickly to where it was or out of my sight.\n\nWhich also could mean that this thing can move quickly, it really does levitate, and seems to be trying to get closer to me. I haven't been outside since and probably will be sure to stick around my cats for the time being. I mean, we have no dogs and the next best tactic would be to use the fish but I don't think that will do much or anything. sorry I'm just taking to make this less startling.\n\nBut this is what I am guessing it's doing. It's trying to get closer to me or the animals. As if it is studying me or the animals, maybe both. And that it's gaining confidence in what it is doing. But what does this mean? It doesn't seem to be doing anything to my family. Just me, or that it doesn't present itself to them. Maybe, just maybe, me seeing it that one night might have something to do with this. And the same with the cats, which doesn't make sense. Since those cats are all dead, well except one. But this that still makes no sense to why it is only showing itself to me. \n\nThis is a more tame story and probably a theory one, but this is another encounter with it. I will continue updating on anything new. I also want to say that I'm not sure if it has been watching me this whole time, just typing and that. But these have been the encounters between me and it. If anything else big happens I will be sure to update.\n\nNow, Have a nice day\/night and be safe. There are things out there we just don't understand.\n\nEdit: I want to make it clear that I have no idea what the black thing is either. I don't even want to know if the two are related somehow.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Humanoidencounters","subreddit_id":"t5_31wuv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Humanoidencounters","subreddit_subscribers":30831,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"The white thing","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Humanoidencounters\/comments\/93khmm\/the_white_thing\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

(I hope this is an appropriate sub.)\n\nHi, I'm ranting on the internet to unleash my panic and frustration and to perhaps receive some advice from peeps who may have similar experiences. Here is my long rant:\n\nI'm a 24 year old female living in a major city and feeling like I'm wasting my time and potential on little piddly, low-paying \"jobs\" that by no means amount to a career. BUT, at the same time, I kind of like these little piddly, low-paying jobs because they are EXTREMELY low-pressure, low hours, and I actually like the work I'm doing.\n\nI worked in an office once before and was absolutely MISERABLE. The corporate world IS NOT FOR ME. And I do not want to force myself to be a part of it when there MUST BE other ways of making strong earnings.\n\nI am just able to cover my living expenses on my earnings, but I am starting to panic that I am 24 years old and I have no savings. In the future, I want to be able to purchase a home, have capital to start my own business, and eventually retire. I just can't seem to get myself on an upward path.\n\nTo be specific, I have 3 part-time jobs that amount to approximately 30 hours per week, but my schedule is often subject to cancellations based on my bosses' personal lives.\n\nFirst job: I run a resell eBay store that an older woman in my community started but can no longer maintain. I run every aspect of the store: sourcing items, photographing the items, creating the listings, customer service, and shipping.\n\nSecond job: I am the photographer\/videographer for a local clothing designer. I also help her with social media and various technology tasks.\n\nThird job: I designed and now run an online store for ANOTHER clothing designer. I created the website, designed the online store, photograph, measure, and describe all products, create the listings, manage social media, and do all shipping.\n\nEach of these jobs pay me $15 per hour.\n\nI feel like I have no idea what I want to do in life, but I know that I have always LOVED clothes. Even as a quiet person, I have somehow become known in my (large) city for my personal style, which gives me a little bit of confidence in thinking that perhaps I should let my love for clothing guide my career path. I would love to open my own brick and mortar store, but understand that is a tough gig. I would also be happy owning an online store.\n\nFor a little added context, I have a Bachelor of Arts degree and graduated Summa Cum Laude, if that means anything. Though it was not my major, I completed an entire \"fieldwork\" semester that focused on public relations, communications, and marketing. (At the time, I concluded that it was sleazy work!)\n\nDo you have any suggestions that may help me strengthen my earnings and launch myself into a real career?\n\n**TLDR: I like the work I'm doing but it doesn't make me much money and I feel like I am stuck in a low-paying rut.**","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/personalfinance","subreddit_subscribers":13220341,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I'm 24 years old and make less than 20K per year.

So, to avoid telling the whole long story. Here is a basic gist of it:\n\nI'm a 25 year old male who is daignosed with autism and concentration issues. But, that's JUST the beginning. My bosts is a piece of -ahum- and he has hurt me deeply serveral times. Anything from false promises to praising me one day and scolding me for that praise a day later. \n\nBesides work, I have my final project in college to do and I'm afraid that due to the stress from work I'll be unable to finish it with good marks. \n\nOn top of that, I feel that I can't put any further progress in my other hobbies like acting in folk theatre and writing my stories. \n\nAt this moment, I'm home alone for two weeks. I'm well into the 2nd week now and my mom scolds me for not going to eat with my grandmom. The thing is, I'm experimenting to cook myself and my grandmom helps me with that. She calls me and gives me pointers on what to do. And when I proudly send my mom; \"Look, I cooked some soup\" or \"Look, I cooked this myself\"... She gets annoyed and says over Whatsapp: \"You aren't going to eat with your grandmother\" -\\_-' \n\nAnd don't get my started in my love life. I have tried Tinder, dating websites and even asking out girls from my circle of friends. They all ignore my date request, and what I mean by that is that they never reply to it. And when they see me the next time, they don't mention it. So, I don't know if it's a yes or no or if I'm friendzoned... I'm 25 years old and I'm heavily afraid I won't find a girlfriend. \n\nEach girl I talk too is either put off by my love of gaming\/anime or my autism or my social awkwardness or something else. \n\nAnd yes, this is just the tip of the shitberg. My self esteem is on a rollercoaster and it's taking more trips down then up. I wish I was able to rebuild my self-esteem but each time I take a step closer, something happens and I need months of therapy to get my self-esteem back up at where it was in my years of college. Man, this world is harsh. Truly harsh. \n\nSo, that's my story. I'm sorry if I didn't post it in the right place and if so, I'll delete it... but it feels kinda nice just writing it out.

I need a bit of help of overcoming my situation, as I'm a bit real-world-naive and would appreciate any guidance! Sorry if some of my questions are stupid :\/ I've looked online but everything assumes I have savings\/income\/a place to live, I need one to get the others so IDk what to do!!\n\n**Situation**: I'm 18 transferring to a university in San Diego this Fall. I've just been kicked out all the sudden by my parents and now have no idea how I'm gonna pay for college or even have a place to stay. I have no job (wasn't allowed to have one) , no money saved up (except $60 pay pal) , no friends\/family. My parents refused to fill out FAFSA though we're pretty poor and would get quite some aid. People said in my situation getting a dependence override is virtually impossible so if my parents aren't providing information I pretty much can't get aid.\n\nSo the two concerns I have are **1-** tuition **2-** living.\n\nI assume that once I get there I have to firstly get whatever job I can get and start saving immediately. But don't jobs usually ask for address? How would I cash the checks since I don't have a bank account?\n\n**1- tuition:** Since I don't have FAFSA I can't take out non-private loans (I've been told to never ever do private loans). So I'd have to just pay out of pocket, through the university's monthly payment plan right? Is this even possible for me, since I have no savings or income? I've called the university but they've just given me very vague information, and told me to go to their office in person but I live in another part of california. Anyone have any ideas about how I could make this work?\n\n**2- place to stay:** How would I find a place to stay since I don't have any savings (they all ask for \\~3xmonths + deposit + income) ? Is it that I pretty much have to explain my situation to landlords\/roommates and see who trusts me to pay back in a few months or something? What ways can I convince them? I've looked at airbnb and I do see some $10 a night places that I could stay at for like a week, using my paypal money.\n\nAgain I have no clue what I'm doing or how anything works and thus, I'd appreciate anyone who can provide a bit of guidance or advice, or even just support that this is possible lol. Thanks so so so much :) &lt;3","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/personalfinance","subreddit_subscribers":13220341,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Kicked out of house, not sure how to pay tuition or rent?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/93kml7\/kicked_out_of_house_not_sure_how_to_pay_tuition\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I'm not great any more, I admit it. I have spasticity in my legs meaning the muscles don't cooperate like they should meaning I'm pretty unsteady. I have two crutches for short distance and use a mobility scooter if I have to travel more than a short distance. My leg muscles are in a constant state of cramp known as chronic fatigue. I'm numb down my right side which has affected the functionality of my bladder and bowel. I have had a burning sensation like both feet are being BBQ'd 24 hours a day 7 days a week. It's made sleeping pretty impossible through the pain and when I do get to sleep my poor bladder functionality is often on hand to wake me up and then I can't sleep again. I've been given cocktails of different drugs all which made me come out in boils or just knocked me out so I messed the bed numerous times. The drugs, lack of sleep and a stomach like a washing machine with all the bowel medication made me quite ill and I lost about 3 stone in weight. Now despite all that I try and do everything I can round the house to save my wife having to do stuff when she gets home as she's a teacher and is usually up late marking books and planning lessons. It messes me up tidying up a family home but I do it regardless in the hope that she might find some time for me in her busy schedule. However I've noticed for some time that she was becoming more withdrawn and distant from me. In the end I asked what it was that I was doing wrong. The answer that came back my way was \"emotionally I've got nothing for you in your state, I didn't sign up for this!\". \nNow I certainly didn't sign up for this either and have been trying as hard as I can to get the Stem Cell treatment done so I can get cured, I've even read that in some cases the Stem Cell treatment has gone on to repair some of the damage that has been done. My twin brother is desperate for me to go for the Stem Cell treatment, he even offered to finance it private for me. It was at this point that my wife decided to abuse my brother for just wanting to throw money at me and take it upon herself to manage my expectations telling me that it's totally unrealistic and how it wouldn't improve things for me and instead of focusing on that I should be chasing up with the doctor about getting the pain in my feet sorted out even though she knows I'm on a waiting list to see a pain management specialist. I managed to convince her to go to couples counselling with me which we have just started. I can't talk to her if I bring up my concerns about anything she dismisses them as unimportant\u200b or not a big deal. I sometimes find myself in the middle of the night when her and the kids are long fast asleep, having a little cry about how shitty my life is. Then I get her throwing out about how she's going through it too. Yes of course it must be difficult for so many reasons for her I do understand. It's just... Well... It's not really the reaction I signed up for either. If it was her suffering I would be behaving like my twin encouraging her to stay positive and doing everything I could to try and help her get well. She also asked me if I was looking forward to getting my back payment of \u00a38000 in disability money the government owed me. Before promptly transferring it into another account when it came in. Apparently she's saving it for me in the bank so I don't waste it and if I do want something I can save up for it. I'm not really sure where to go from here, I just feel so lonely.

It's gonna be a really long post, and I can surely understand if you didn't read it 'till the end. But those who do it, I want you to know that I treasure you.\n\n-First of all, I should write some stuff about myself. I'm 19, I'm studying in a good university and I like studying. So far I've never had a girlfriend because I've always thought having someone so important in my life can keep me from focusing on my studies. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against love between two people, I actually like thinking about it. I love romace films, I love seeing a lovely sunset by the sea and thinking that the hand of someone I had a crush on holding mine could make it a lot better. But until this year I've never actually opened up to someone, and when I did it it didn't very well; and I was shaken by it. It's been a while though.\n\n-I don't have many friends. It's not because that I don't like being social, it's because I have moved so much I never really get to bond with people. As an example, I am moving abroad this year after moving for m university last year after moving to another city for my last year of high school... I've moved so many times I lost count. So, those few friends that I have are really dear to me.\n\n-This is not the really place to write this down but I am kinda obsessed about the color red. And kinda in a weird way. As far as this story is concerned, I am into redheads.\n\n-I just asked out to a girl who works at the cafe I went regularly (Their coffe is not that great and yes, I go there to see her). Haven't went on a date with her though.\n\nSo, I want to start telling my story.\n\nMy dream started as a not-so-regular day. See, I live far away from my friends. So when I want to see them, I usually have to travel some distances and spend a lot of time on the road. In my dream I woke up, I got dressed an got on a bus to visit my friend, let's call him Jack. Jack lives  four hour bus travel away from me, so I remember being bored. We met, greeted each other and walked for a while. Then he went on to introduce me to his friends.\n\nThere were four of them, two guys and two girls. The boys, both of them were tall. Taller than us. See, my friend Jack is a little short and I have a ordinary height, but this guys were longer than us. One of them was a bit chubby, not fat but a little overweight (So am I). He had curly hair which was not too short but neither too long. The other one was skinnier, but he was in shape. He had long hair. One of the girls' height was a little longer for a girl and she had black hair. She wore a t-shirt and jeans.\n\nThe other girl... Since I met her only in a dream I think\nI can congrarulate my subconcious for creating the perfect female I could ever dream. First of all, I do not remember any details about her face other than she had a dimple. But I remember feeling her face wasn't something exceptionally beautiful. She was a bit short, short enough that I can lean my head on her head while we were hugging. She wore a red jacket on top of a black shirt and a red skirt, but the color of the skirt was darker. She had a shiny red lipstick on her lips. And her hair... That is something I can clearly rember but can't express. All I'm gonna say is to me, it looked like the last light shone by the sun on the sea at the sunset. I'm going to let you imagine it. \n\nAnywho, we greeted each other in an alley and went on to chat for a while. I must've thought this bit wasn't too important because it's a bit blurry. I remember walking, chatting and believe it or not, playing a game of catch-me-if-you-can (Skinny guy was the best of us). \n\nAs I said, I live far away. So I was going to stay at Jack's house. He said that he planned to host all of us that night. Then he went off to tidy his home and tell his parents that he needed the house for the day and ask them if they can stay at his brother's house for the night. And he went.\n\nI was alone with Jack's friends and for some reason everybody was awkward. The two guys giggled a bit, and then started to walk away slowly, still giggling. The black-haired girls said \"Ugh!\" and turned her back. I was confused. Then I saw the girl (literally the girl in my dreams) smiling at me. She started to walk towards me, making me wondering the taste of her lips. She reached me, and we hugged.\n\nI tell you, if we kissed I wouldn't be writing it down. I dreamed about kissing girls before. I've never kissed someone in my life so my subconcious sometimes wonders what it's like and decides to make out with someone in my dreams. But this was not the case.\n\nThat hug was something I never experienced, real or in my dreams. Believe it or not, at the moment I can still feel the warmth of her body. I'm a guy who can be happy even with the sound of a bird singing, or a dog barking. But this kind of happines I've never experienced before. It. Was. Unbelievable.\n\nRest is a bit blurry for me. Next thing I remember was the five of us (Jack wasn't there) were in a roof. The boys were leaning on a wall and watching us. The black-haired girl was sitting on another wall a little away from us, and she was still making the same \"Ugh\" sound. We were sitting together, sharing an orange and fluffy blanket and swinging our feet on the roof. Her head was resting on my left cheek, and vice versa. Nobody was talking (I got to say, since I woke up, my left cheek is on fire). It was a moment of peace. But I ruined it, being the massive idiot I usually am and asking this girl to not mention what happened to my friend, Jack. Because I thoughy he would get angry if he find out I was dating a friend of his (somehow it made sense to me).\n\nAgain, a bit blurry. Next thing I remember is getting yelled at by Jack, while holding hands with this girl. She was looking at me, I was staring into Jack's eyes but I was in peace. This girl made me feel peaceful.\n\nRest of the dream is just like a slide of pictures for me. Everyone was happy, there was a lot of dancing, talking playing and stuff. Everyone was really happy. And still, I've had this dream almost 18 hours ago and I'm still unbelievably happy.\n\nFor the life of me, I can't figure out why did this dream had such an impact on me. For a whole day, my only thought was this dream. I've wrote it down and store it in my wallet and I still, still feel the warmth of that girl. It feels like something I should cherish for a long, long time.\n\nAnd truth be told, after having this drean I kinda lost my interest to the girl at the cafe. I know it's riddicilous. I don't know why. I need someone to help me understand what this dream was all about and why did it affect me so much. Again, I know nobody will read this post that long but to some people who might, I've got to say you are really precious to me.\n\nTL;DR : I had a dream, something that had an impact on me and I can't explain why. It involves a girl. No, nothing sexual. I can't think anything except it since I had the dream\n\n*I apologize for any grammatical error.

I posted about it here as well:  \nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cycling\/comments\/92otl3\/so_is_the_cannondale_slate_just_a_better_hybrid\/  \n  \nI looked high and low for a direct competitor to the Slate and there aren't any, anywhere.  There's literally no drop bar bike with a real front suspension anywhere on the market, aside from building your own.  So that combined with the fact this was the last 2017 at my LBS, it was a Large and actually somehow fit me perfectly (I'm 6'3\" and all of my other bikes have been XL), and they were going to give it to me $1400 under MSRP at $2100, I just couldn't back away from it.  \n  \nIn the Reddit link above I talk about my experience testing a Specialized Diverge right before testing the Slate, I just can't do it.  I know almost all of you are diehard rigid cyclo\/gravel people but the Diverge literally sounded like it was about to come apart over the brick road I was riding on.  In fact I actually felt the need to slow down, which I don't even do while riding on my Hybrid.  Yes I was putting my weight on my feet and not just sitting on the seat, proper hand grip, etc.  The primary brick road I used for testing is really bad, in some sections imagine this picture but it's bricks and not roots, with maybe 1\/2 the roots\/bricks showing in the picture (It's really the only picture I found to give an accurate description).  Add in some 6\" dips right behind the raised bricks and you'll understand:  \nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/vQHZkUg  \n  \nThe thing is, the Slate just pounds over this road.  In my ride today I checked back on Strava and was going 20mph over this road (the less rooted side, but still rough).  A rigid fork bike just can't do that, not on the level that the Slate did.  \n  \nAfter my first real ride on it today for 10 miles, damp streets after it rained, the bike is just amazing.  The bigger tires combines with the lefty fork just let you pound over rough surfaces, in all honesty your aren't penalized over smooth surfaces with the bigger tires and the fork.  On my normal route is a hospital with 3 parking garages totaling 21 stories up and down, no problem.  I ride a LOT on sidewalks because I'm not risking my life on the road and the sidewalks here are usually completely empty anyway, bombing and doing manuals up and down the sidewalk ramps and side streets, no problem.  Neighborhood roads that might be rough?  You don't feel a thing.  \n  \nI can't honestly think of a single bike that would be a better city bike\/commuter bike, caveat is as long as you can keep it safe inside your office, etc.  \n  \nIf you're offroading why aren't you riding a Slate?  There are good reasons it won the Dirty Kanza 200 multiple times and is ridden on the Cannondale teams.  Why beat yourself up with a rigid bike when a Slate can do what your rigid can do, but not beat the crap out of you on your rides?  \n  \nI personally don't understand it.  I think the purists here need to go test a Slate and get some first hand riding with it, because it might change your mind.  It's really a shame that people see it as a red headed step child because in most circumstances it can do everything your bike can do, and with a lot more comfort and versatility added in.  \n  \nThe bike also capitalizes on FUN.  I can't believe how good 30mm of travel can be, coming from my hardtail with 130mm Rockshox I was amazed at how much the fork is tuned to be a success.  The first 10mm is the stiffest to prevent as much pedal bob as possible, the only time I really felt like I wanted to lock it out was going up and down the parking garages.  On the flats I left it open the entire time.  When you aren't being serious it encourages you to be stupid.  Do bunny hops.  Do Manuals.  It wants you to.  Bomb off some curbs and jump some roots.  The Slate literally doesn't care, and on top of that with the bigger tires and the fork up front it will take care of you the entire time.\n  \nI get that at full MSRP it's expensive, but other bikes with full Ultegra gear, disc brakes, carbon fork, etc., are pretty much the same price as this bike.  Some are more expensive as a matter of fact, but if you can get a Slate at a good price just don't even think about it because you're not going to regret it.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"bicycling","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi0s","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/bicycling","subreddit_subscribers":347343,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"NBD: Cannondale Slate Ultegra with First Impressions","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bicycling\/comments\/93kvj3\/nbd_cannondale_slate_ultegra_with_first\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

That seems to be a common kink these days, and consenting adults can do whatever they both consent to but its not for me. I *am* into humiliation and degradation, but to a point.\n\nSo quite a few of my prompts have gone a bit wrong, hence that opening bit. What I'm looking for is a woman 24+ who is interested in submission, even if inexperienced. Not just for a one-off where I tell you how to touch yourself and you cum and then ghost. I'm looking to *build* something and it won't happen right away. I know that and *you* need to know that as well.\n\nI enjoy control and direction and have a knack for organizing and planning. I'm not just looking to have sext sessions, I *love* having honest and stimulating conversations but am rubbish at small talk.\n\nKinks that I'm into and am ideally looking to work towards are: outfit control, orgasm control, JOI, raceplay, light bondage, discreet play, assigning rules &amp; tasks, humiliation &amp; degradation, light pet play. Maybe some pee tasks, my last sub wanted to experiment with it and it was new to me. I'm open to exploring but at this point I'd consider it a curiosity rather than outright kink. My limits: pain (I only do light pain), blood, scat, too public, illegal, kids, puke, scars\/marks.\n\nAbout me non-kink: I am intelligent and insightful. Socially progressive. Feminist. Socialist. The only sport I like is ice hockey but I don't watch the NHL; I prefer the Olympics (usually) and the World Championships in May. I also try to catch Eurovision every year even though I'm american. My favorite language to sing along to is Finnish but most commonly-listened to genre is K-pop. I can read Finnish, Russian, and Korean but sadly don't speak any of them yet. I work full time and hit the gym 4-5 times a week. I'm 5'10\" with short hair and glasses hiding hazel eyes. I'm an INTJ and absolutely shit at writing these ads.\n\nAbout you non-kink: Pretty much you do you. Similar interests are great for breaking the ice but they won't guarantee we're what we're looking for in each other. As long as you enjoy stimulating conversation and have **a** passion with an open mind, I'm sure the normal stuff will develop fine.

Class usually last around an hour which consist of warm ups, bag drills which including kicking and punching, working on form, movement and last 15 to 20 minutes sparring or rolling bjj which is awful. I haven't seen the main sensei but his son does the kid classes and sometimes adult classes and two much instructors which are all black belts.\n\nDojo B\n\nClasses Tuesday-Thursday  Discover on the website useasternwado.com\n\nAlso has an adult class but has 6-7 adults as far as i know the two days I went and 1 teenager. There are 3 sensei I think but I've only been training with 1 so far and he is really good to me at least. Class is also an hour long and we do warm ups for 10 minutes then we work on form or movement and he is very detail about his work which I like and he explains everything why it's important to do this and how this helps doing kata forms. Out of the two classes so far we haven't sparred and only used the bags once. We haven't even cover sparring at all but most of the adults in the class are white belts with 1 yellow and 1 brown belt as I know.\n\nI know it's only 2 classes so far and I have a lot to learn but I'm just confused why it feels so different despite teaching the same thing. I am leaning towards dojo b but the whole we haven't sparred yet concerning me but my sensei seems to still spar and maybe he just wants to wait a bit until we get our next belt maybe?
