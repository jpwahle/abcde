I only live a bit over 3 hours away in Chicago, but it just never seemed worth it. It was always just a bit too far away to burn a day on. That's a 7 hour round trip, and for what? One woodie that looks pretty good but that nobody ever talks about? \n\nThe math just wasn't there. I could just drive the extra 70 ish minutes each way and be at Cedar Point, or Kings Island. Why would I ever pick Michigans adventure over CP or KI? And when I don't feel like a road trip, I'm 20 minutes away from from of the best top to bottom lineups in the country with Great America. And so there Michigans Adventure sat, unvisited, weekend after weekend for years.\n\nCovid lit a fire under my ass. I saw how fragile some of these smaller parks are and things you take comfort in thinking \"they'll always be there\" or that \"I'll get there one day\" aren't as solid of a cornerstone as they used to be. I made lists of parks and more specifically bucket list coasters that come hell or high water, I'm riding in the next few years. Shivering Timbers was high on my list of must do, so when Memorial Day came up, and I had a day off, no plans, and a tank full of gas, I made the trip.\n\nI have been to Michigan before, but only Detroit and the surrounding areas. I've never been to this part of Michigan, and I must say, it's beautiful. It's clean, well manicured, gorgeous nature all around with the trees, rivers and lake Michigan to your west, and all of the roads were perfect. And the boats, goodness the boats. The more north I drove, the more secluded and beautiful it got. \n\nAs I got closer, it really seemed like an amusement park shouldn't be there. I mean, you're literally on little side streets and whatnot driving through a very small town in a heavily forested area, but sure enough, Google maps didn't lie, that park is there just beyond the trees.\n\nYou're initially greeted by Shivering Timbers which is so large and obnoxious, it literally spans the length of the parking lot. It's a great placement for the parks main draw.\n\nParking and entry were standard, but the employees here are extra, extra friendly.\n\nI didn't know where to go or what to do, but I vaguely remembered reading the wild mouse there gets bad lines as the day goes and since it was right at the front, I went there first. It was about 10 mins to open and so the queue wasn't open yet, but I was first in line, and so I waited. I was pretty pumped. I don't really like wild mice coasters, but I've never been on one of the super rare Arrow ones. After about 7 minutes, a security guard came over and asked if I was waiting for the wild mouse and informed me it wouldn't be open that day. Bummer, but no big deal, it's not why I'm there.\n\nSo I back away and the only other ride I know it's location is the arrow corkscrew I passed by when I walked in. It was now a minute before open so this ride had a few dozen people in line already. The ride was ok, it's the smallest corkscrew model with a drop, turn around, corkscrew. Smooth for such an old ride, but very unremarkable.\n\nNext up was  Thunderhawk. This ride, also was ok. I'm not a SLC fan, but as far as SLCs go, this one was tolerable. I don't want to oversell it here, it's still just an SLC, and it's still a nightmare, but it's one of the better ones I've experienced.\n\nNext up was Zach's Zoomer. It just looked like a small scale woodie. Once I was on it, I was getting serious Woodstock Express vibes. I'm not 100%, but I think it's just a clone of those with a different name. It's fun for what it is, but no big deal.\n\nNext up was Wolverine Wildcat. This is a fun ride. I don't care what others say. It's a fun, fast mid sized woodie with great pops of air and strong laterals. The titan track made the first part super smooth. It does have some violent parts, and some jackhammering, and some potholes, but it's still loads of fun. Ended up coming back for 2 more laps spread out throughout the day.\n\nAnd last but not least was Shivering Timbers. I'm going to close out the post with my thoughts on ST.\n\nOverall I had a fun day. Dare I say, it's a fun little park that exceeded my very low expectations. \n\nIt's clean, well manicured, has a great, very friendly staff, an amazing location, and has some very unique (for a Cedar fair park) flats. It's not an overly busy park, so crowds and lines are easy to navigate.\n\nI think the hate comes from people seeing the Cedar Fair branding and expecting a Cedar Point or a Knott's or something. Of course if you go in with that mindset, you'll walk away disappointed. \n\nThink of it more like a Kentucky Kingdom or a Six Flags St. Louis and you'll have a great day. It's a small park that you can get some fun laps on some good and great rides and be done with the park in half a day. Could they use a few more coasters? Absolutely, I can make an argument that every park in existence could use more coasters, but to call it a bad park, or to tell others it's not worth your time is elitist and flat out wrong. Just know what you're getting into before you go and I promise you'll have fun.\n\nMichigans Adventure is UNDER RATED and I will be returning.\n\nOn to Shivering Timbers. This is a masterpiece. It's almost perfect. \n\nI dont count, but I've been on a lot of rollercoasters and I can count on one hand the rides I walked off literally shocked. In fact, the only rides that I can think of that surprised me this much are in my flair, X2, Voyage, and I305. \n\nIn my Carowinds review, I said Fury was as close to a technically perfect rollercoaster as I've ever experienced. When it comes to wood coasters, I'd slap the same statement on Shivering Timbers. \n\nThe air and laterals are ridiculous. I prefer wood over steel, and for as many woodies as I've been on, I didn't know that kind of sustained floater air was even possible on wood. I thought it was reserved for steel. This thing is a wooden B&amp;M hyper, while being way better than every B&amp;M hyper.\n\nSeriously, this thing shits on Mako, this thing shits on Diamondback, and I LOVE those rides. Diamondback is my \"gold standard\" for sustained floater that I compare everything to, and Shivering Timbers embarrasses it.\n\nI can hear you through the screen, \"this guy is talking nonsense. He's been on one too many arrow loopers and it knocked his brain out of whack and now and has a few screws loose. There's no way\". I'm trying to tell you, you have to get out here. This thing is Voyage Caliber and almost nobody is talking about it.\n\nHere's a small sampling of \"world class rides\" I've been on that I think ST is better than. Fury 325, Mystic Timbers, Ghost rider, Velocicoaster, Lightning Rod, Twisted Timbers, Maverick.\n\nIts in my top 5 folks. It's that good. It's cheesey or whatever, but it's finding rides like Shivering Timbers that keep me involved in this hobby. Where element after element are hitting perfectly and you're smiling like an idiot from ear to ear for 2 minutes straight. \n\nRides like Shivering Timbers are why I spend so much time and money on travel, going park to park to park trying everything in my power to find that next X2, or find that next Voyage, and who would've thought I'd find it in the middle of nowhere Michigan in the small town of Muskegon","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"rollercoasters","subreddit_id":"t5_2rzez","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/rollercoasters","subreddit_subscribers":80833,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[Trip Report] [Michigan's Adventure] 5-30-22","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.97,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/rollercoasters\/comments\/v2fcq5\/trip_report_michigans_adventure_53022\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Ideally, I'd prefer to start off as friends to ensure we establish a solid foundation. \n\nCurrently, I work as a counselor at a private family practice. I work with children, teens, and adults. While it has its challenges, I absolutely love my work. I would definitely enjoy learning about your work. A few of my other passions are video games, music, and movies\/shows\/anime. When it comes to video games, I mainly play on the PS5 but I also play on the Switch and PC. Some of my favorite games are Nier Automata, Hollow Knight, Borderlands (series) and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. As for music, I enjoy a variety of genres such as Neo-Soul, Punk, Hip-Hop, Electronia and Classical. Nina Simone is a favorite of mine. In terms of movies\/shows\/anime, I enjoy projects such as My Girl, The Mandalorian, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Marvel\/DC properties and A Silent Voice. \n\nI also enjoy traveling. It's exciting to experience other cultures! There's much that we can learn from one another both individually and as a whole. The world then becomes simultaneously larger and smaller. I find it quite fascinating! Do you have any fun or interesting stories of your travels? \n\nMy love languages are words of affirmation, quality time, gift giving and physical touch. Yet, I'd say words of affirmation is my strongest love language. I enjoy uplifting others, especially my loved ones. With a relationship, this manifests in actions such as an occasional love letter or a reminder that you're on my mind. You will always have my full support. When I truly invest into someone, I do my utmost best to support them as long as they reciprocate my support. This doesn't mean you need to completely match whatever I provide.

Also, I'd prefer that you live within the U.S. The plan is to talk for a couple of months and then meet up in-person. There's no need to rush though.

I first started out on 2mg estridol via those little bluesublingual, and 25mg of spironolactone, was then shortly moved to 6mg estridol. After about 1 year of lacking progress I was put on 100mg progesterone, then shortly after I switched to injections, .15 ml 40mg \/ ml. I have been on injections close to a year. My most recent levels were 665pg\/ml estridol, and 25 ng\/dl, was probably 2 days after injection I'm not sure exactly. My levels always come back fine as I can tell. Another thing to note is that I can't swallow the pills, so I chew the spiro, and with the progesterone I break open the capsule and basically drink the liquid lol. (My doc knows this)\n\nThe main of this is that I have almost no breast growth, what I do have is very minor and I would say buds would be almost exaggerating. I am 5ft 8 and when I started was 220lb, I have lost weight since starting and am around 185 usually. I have not gained any weight since starting and I an thinking of weight cycling. Any advice for me? I'm starting to be extremely discouraged entirely, as far as genetics go, most of the women in my family are fairly large chested, around a D cup. Another thing to note is I do lactate and have consitantly for a while now, not sure if that's any indication of anything. My doctor Is just as confused as I am about the lack of progress. I forgot to mention but I am 22 years old, started at 20. I did lose some muscle mass but I'm overall still naturally beefy lol, even though I don't really exercise much anymore.

My name is James. I am 26 years old and I live in Georgia. What I'm looking for is a long-term relationship. I am looking for a partner 24 years or older. Also, I'd prefer that you live within the U.S. Ideally, I'd prefer to start off as friends to ensure we establish a solid foundation for our relationship. \n\nCurrently, I work as a counselor at a private family practice. While it has its challenges, I absolutely love my work. I would definitely enjoy learning about your work. A few of my other passions are video games, music, movies\/shows and anime. When it comes to video games, I mainly play on the PS5 but I also play on the Switch and PC. Some of my favorite games are Nier Automata, Hollow Knight, Borderlands (series) and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. As for music, I enjoy a variety of genres such as Neo-Soul, Punk, Hip-Hop, Electronia and Classical. Nina Simone is a favorite of mine. In terms of movies\/shows\/anime, I enjoy projects such as My Girl, The Mandalorian, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Marvel\/DC properties and A Silent Voice.

I have always had an issue with it since I was a child (had my first bet at 12) and if I estimate what I have gambled away in my lifetime it makes me sick to my stomach. I have probably lost over 250k and easily could be much more. Over 20 years it is all a blur. \n\nI am hear asking advice for a particular situation. I came clean to my girlfriend back in October. I just blurted it out, I had to get it out of me. I had lost another sum of borrowed money from the bank in a frenzied attack. I came clean and it really hurt her. I stopped and seeked help,  I was meeting a counsellor online and was trying to show I could do it. Eventually I gambled again, relapsed. I done it as a quick way to make money and pay a bit extra off my credit card. This is the flawed mind of a gambler.\n\nNow fast forward 6 months and I have gotten in more debt. I added another 25k to my debt in this time. This is between borrowed money from bank via a loan and credit cards. I even borrowed a loan to pay off my credit cards as it is better interest than the high interest rates from cash withdrawals on credit cards. After I paid them off I never cancelled them and once again I took from them. It is absolutely insane. \n\nI was planning on proposing this summer as she is turning 33 and I am 32. She does not know about this relapse over the six months. I wasn't even clean that long, so would I even call it a relapse. I am still speaking to my counsellor online and was pretending that everything is fine, I wanted to show her that I was still doing well. As far as she is concerned I have been. My family were aware of a problem 10 years ago with a much smaller amount. I am afraid to burden them with it. I am not looking for money but I feel I am very alone. If I tell her she will probable leave me. I am not sure what to do here. \n\nI have many friends and family. My girlfriend is the only person that knows I am in trouble but even now I have betrayed her trust. I am not a bad man but I have put myself into a bad situation and I am really feeling the pressure of everything now. \n\nI can't believe how much I have fucked my life up, it is like a movie in someways as it feels so surreal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have two brothers that I am tempted to speak to. We are pretty close but I am ashamed to take the step. I really feel isolated right now and the burden is taking its toll.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"problemgambling","subreddit_id":"t5_2vjm4","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/problemgambling","subreddit_subscribers":16940,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Like many others, I have found myself in a very difficult situation.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.83,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/problemgambling\/comments\/v2fox7\/like_many_others_i_have_found_myself_in_a_very\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

The university has been great so far, and it truly is what I have always dreamed of. The professors, the lectures, the city, everything is just great, and I don't want to give it up for anything. Only problem is that I might have to, at least that is what I thought. Housing in that city is extremely expensive, and I simply cannot afford it anymore, not even nearby. So not wanting to move away and quit my university, I got desperate and looked everywhere for a cheap place to live, told all of my friends, and posted something to the university's blackboard. And that is when somebody contacted me!\n\nThere was a special dorm that only hands out invitations in my city. I would have a big 2 room apartment, my own kitchen, my own bathroom, it already had all the furniture that I needed, and it would not cost me a dime to stay there! What is the catch you may ask yourself? There are basically two types of people there. There were the \"owners\" that would pay quite the sum to live there, and the \"pets\", that would have to walk around naked, and if the \"owners\" wanted anything sexual from them, they could take what they wanted. They did not even have any doors in their apartments, unlike the owners. Things like condoms, or not cumming inside were encouraged by the management, but totally optional.\n\nI have heard about this dorm before but I was unsure about it. At least at first. The more I thought about it, the more the idea of not only a free apartment, but free sex sounded just great to me. Being a little shy, it was sometimes difficult for me to make the first step, but that would probably be taken care of there.\n\nAnd so I moved in, eager, curious, and slightly intimidated by what was to come.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHello again!\n\nThis prompt can go quite I few ways I believe. Will we start a wholesome relationship in this strange new environment, become friends with benefits, will I simply be a walking sexdoll, will you take me as your own, with or without my consent? Will I enjoy this or regret this? Just be sure to tell me your plans, or make that clear in your starter, if you don't feel like discussing anything.\n\nA little about me: My name is Sophia, I am 22, brunette, brown eyes, 1.61m, petite, average breasts and ass. I have prepared some ref pics, but they obviously aren't actually of myself.\n\nSome of the kinks I would want to include are: Breeding, free-use, dubious consent, anal, and oral.\n\nMy limits are scat, gore, vore, and snuff.\n\nIf you are looking for another kink, [try your luck here!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fzZTfeA.png)\n\nIt would probably be best to include your limits too, which I would like to see in my PMs ;)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dirtypenpals","subreddit_subscribers":458060,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[F4M] Paying For The Dorm Rent With My Ass","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtypenpals\/comments\/v2fscs\/f4m_paying_for_the_dorm_rent_with_my_ass\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

If we end up clicking well, I would like to turn this into a roleplay partner thing where we live out a life together, talk on the daily, more of a girlfriend experience if I may say.\r  \n\r  \nI'm Allen, 24 years old. I'm 6'2\" tall, with blue eyes and medium length wavy black hair. I have a lean but muscular build. I have been into athletics ever since I was a kid. I have no tattoos or piercings over my body. I would like to continue on Reddit itself or Discord.\r  \n\r  \n(My kinks: slutty\/short\/revealing outfits, shopping for new outfits, spoiling, romance, lots of teasing, touching, kissing, marking (hickeys and nail marks), aftercare, sweet pet names, taking pictures\/videos of one another is always a turn on for me. Some kind of rough play (spanking, choking, hair pulling), sloppy kissing, sloppy blowjobs, cock worship, pussy worship, face sitting, trying out different positions, lots of cum, sex in public with a risk of getting caught, clothed sex are some of the others.)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dirtypenpals","subreddit_subscribers":458060,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M4F] Platonic Best Friends' Confession","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtypenpals\/comments\/v2ftib\/m4f_platonic_best_friends_confession\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

People say that I have been super kind that’s why a lot of guys took advantage of the kindness that I gave them for the past years. I know it’s hard to trust people nowadays so please if you’re just going to be another trauma for me, don’t bother messaging. Let’s not waste each other’s time. I prefer taller men. I am 5'4 ☺\n\nI am willing to give my time on you if:\n\na. You’re constant in your motive which is meeting me and my culture.\n\nb. **Not asking for nude pictures\/selfies** (well I can send one just for assurance that I am not fake)\n\nc. Not ask for a video call at the first week of meeting. (that’s awkward for me)\n\nd. Willing to respect my alone time.\n\ne. **YOU ARE USING YOUR OWN PICTURE AND NOT CATFISHING HERE ON REDDIT**.\n\nI am open to friends that turns into relationships but if you just want to be friends, please clear it out so that we will not have a misunderstanding when things get deeper. Lol. My friends say that I have a strong personality and a warm heart at the same time. Well, I guess it’s for me to know and for you to find out. 😉","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ForeverAloneDating","subreddit_id":"t5_2sdpe","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ForeverAloneDating","subreddit_subscribers":205995,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"28 [F4M] Anywhere","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.54,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ForeverAloneDating\/comments\/v2g2ss\/28_f4m_anywhere\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I was friends with a guy but I really liked him 'Ryan', and I kept dropping hints but he just didn't seem to get the memo that I was really into him, I wasn't bold enough to just directly say it to him either. So I had the dumb idea of let me just make myself look easy, guys love easy girls right?\n\nWe were both friends with another guy 'Justin', he was definitely a guy that liked to fuck around and he had always wanted me but I kept turning him down, I was not attracted him, just never had the desire. He always talked about his sexual escapades with us and other friends. So again, the wonderful idea pops up in my head that if I fucked Justin he would talk about it with Ryan and maybe that would finally get Ryan to look at me in that kind of way.\n\nSo I let Justin know I wanted to hang out. He picks me up and we are chilling in his car, its night time, no one is around. I dressed for the occasion. I had a dress on, lots of cleavage showing, and no underwear. I had my dress hiked up at bit, my legs open and one leg a little higher in the air. I think he got the message, he accidently dropped his phone on the car floor and got a nice view of my pussy. I saw a bulge in his pants grow. I had some inspiration and decided to be a little bold and starting rubbing his crotch, he looked shocked. I said to him \"isn't this what you wanted?\" and he says \"yes\". We start stripping and he goes around to my side of the car and I start sucking his cock. His cock was a pretty decent size, I did have fun blowing him. He made me gag a few times. We traded places and me bent me over in the seat and fucked my pussy from behind. He fucked me hard, pulled my hair back, he was slamming his cock deep in me. It was amazing actually, perhaps I should have fucked Justin way before.... He tells me he is getting ready to cum and I tell him to let me finish him in my mouth. He pulls out and I spin around and take his cock back in my mouth. I suck him hard and fast and he explodes in my mouth and I keeping sucking getting every drop out and swallow it all. After that he takes me back home.\n\nJustin did exactly what I thought he would do. He talked about it to Ryan and other friends as well. The next day I had a message from Ryan. Which basically \"You fucked Justin? Wtf?\" and I said \"yeah I did\", no response so I sent a message saying \"Was there something wrong with that?\" and no response.\n\nHe stopped talking to me. Heard through the grapevine that he apparently thought less of me for what I did. So I fucked up, should told Ryan how I felt from the beginning, lost him as a friend too. I don't regret it in the end. I ended up having a good time with Justin and went on to fuck him a few more times.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DirtyConfession","subreddit_id":"t5_36g9k","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/DirtyConfession","subreddit_subscribers":223218,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I Fucked a guy in an attempt to impress another guy [26F]","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.6,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DirtyConfession\/comments\/v2g843\/i_fucked_a_guy_in_an_attempt_to_impress_another\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I always answered yes to the button question, I've had an obsession with gender transformation media since I was ten, I always picked the female protagonist in games, I *adore* feminine clothing, I never corrected she\/her pronouns if I got them online, I loved the idea of femboys, I've never really related to most of the men around me... I'm practically a walking stereotype. But, well, I'm *really* stupid. Because despite *all of that*, my egg only shattered a couple of months ago. Ever since then, my depression and anxiety has grown *so* much worse, because I *know* what the problem is now and I'm so, so scared that I might have to give up pretty much every meaningful relationship I've ever had in order to fix it.\n\nWhich leads me to today. I've been dropping hints to my best friend for a while now, and I've basically been venting to him about everything without *actually* coming out to him as best I could. He's been incredibly supportive throughout the entire experience, and kept insisting that I could dance around things with him for as long as I needed to before I felt comfortable telling him. And, well, I have been. I've wanted to come out to him for a week now, but every single time I work up the courage, he sends me a message about something else and suddenly all of my doubts and fears come back full force. I don't want to lose this, I *can't* lose this, what if this changes things, what if this ruins our friendship for good, what if he abandons me? It sucked.\n\nToday was a pretty rough day for me, and, as usual, I ended it by talking to my friend. Eventually, we get on the topic of my personal issues, and again, he promises me that I can take as long as I need. Well, it's June 1st, it's Pride Month now, and frankly I am *far* too tired to keep up the charade, so I decided, \"fuck it\". I sent him a trans meme.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently he's suspected for months now, if not years.\n\nHe's completely accepting.\n\n***I don't have to go through this alone.***\n\nIf you're reading this, *thank you*. Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you *thank you*.

I was friends with a guy but I really liked him 'Ryan', and I kept dropping hints but he just didn't seem to get the memo that I was really into him, I wasn't bold enough to just directly say it to him either. So I had the dumb idea of let me just make myself look easy, guys love easy girls right?\n\nWe were both friends with another guy 'Justin', he was definitely a guy that liked to fuck around and he had always wanted me but I kept turning him down, I was not attracted him, just never had the desire. He always talked about his sexual escapades with us and other friends. So again, the wonderful idea pops up in my head that if I fucked Justin he would talk about it with Ryan and maybe that would finally get Ryan to look at me in that kind of way.\n\nSo I let Justin know I wanted to hang out. He picks me up and we are chilling in his car, its night time, no one is around. I dressed for the occasion. I had a dress on, lots of cleavage showing, and no underwear. I had my dress hiked up at bit, my legs open and one leg a little higher in the air. I think he got the message, he accidently dropped his phone on the car floor and got a nice view of my pussy. I saw a bulge in his pants grow. I had some inspiration and decided to be a little bold and starting rubbing his crotch, he looked shocked. I said to him \"isn't this what you wanted?\" and he says \"yes\". We start stripping and he goes around to my side of the car and I start sucking his cock. His cock was a pretty decent size, I did have fun blowing him. He made me gag a few times. We traded places and me bent me over in the seat and fucked my pussy from behind. He fucked me hard, pulled my hair back, he was slamming his cock deep in me. It was amazing actually, perhaps I should have fucked Justin way before.... He tells me he is getting ready to cum and I tell him to let me finish him in my mouth. He pulls out and I spin around and take his cock back in my mouth. I suck him hard and fast and he explodes in my mouth and I keeping sucking getting every drop out and swallow it all. After that he takes me back home.\n\nJustin did exactly what I thought he would do. He talked about it to Ryan and other friends as well. The next day I had a message from Ryan. Which basically \"You fucked Justin? Wtf?\" and I said \"yeah I did\", no response so I sent a message saying \"Was there something wrong with that?\" and no response.\n\nHe stopped talking to me. Heard through the grapevine that he apparently thought less of me for what I did. So I fucked up, should told Ryan how I felt from the beginning, lost him as a friend too. I don't regret it in the end. I ended up having a good time with Justin and went on to fuck him a few more times.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"sexstories","subreddit_id":"t5_2qt19","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/sexstories","subreddit_subscribers":365159,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I Fucked a guy in an attempt to impress another guy [26F]","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/sexstories\/comments\/v2ggdh\/i_fucked_a_guy_in_an_attempt_to_impress_another\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Large desolate lands, abandoned cities, and so on. You'll be given a starter kit with a soldier like loadout depending on what you soldiers role is. Once we have gotten these base requirements met the roleplay will begin.\nWe will start together in an abandoned building with minor supplies, a few tools, overall not much. The zombies can see us from long distances, climb high, creepers target and blast walls, and more. \nIf this sounds interesting to you please DM me and I'll ask a few questions and get you set up.\n\nThanks for reading, I hope to have some of you join me for a long play session. Also, do note I am 18 but there is no age requirement other than the rules of this Reddit.\n\nFor those that want specs, the server is 4G with a fully dedicated CPU.

I am 26 now and this happened about 6 years ago. I was friends with a guy but I really liked him 'Ryan', and I kept dropping hints but he just didn't seem to get the memo that I was really into him, I wasn't bold enough to just directly say it to him either. So I had the dumb idea of let me just make myself look easy, guys love easy girls right?\n\nWe were both friends with another guy 'Justin', he was definitely a guy that liked to fuck around and he had always wanted me but I kept turning him down, I was not attracted him, just never had the desire. He always talked about his sexual escapades with us and other friends. So again, the wonderful idea pops up in my head that if I fucked Justin he would talk about it with Ryan and maybe that would finally get Ryan to look at me in that kind of way.\n\nSo I let Justin know I wanted to hang out. He picks me up and we are chilling in his car, its night time, no one is around. I dressed for the occasion. I had a dress on, lots of cleavage showing, and no underwear. I had my dress hiked up at bit, my legs open and one leg a little higher in the air. I think he got the message, he accidently dropped his phone on the car floor and got a nice view of my pussy. I saw a bulge in his pants grow. I had some inspiration and decided to be a little bold and starting rubbing his crotch, he looked shocked. I said to him \"isn't this what you wanted?\" and he says \"yes\". We start stripping and he goes around to my side of the car and I start sucking his cock. His cock was a pretty decent size, I did have fun blowing him. He made me gag a few times. We traded places and me bent me over in the seat and fucked my pussy from behind. He fucked me hard, pulled my hair back, he was slamming his cock deep in me. It was amazing actually, perhaps I should have fucked Justin way before.... He tells me he is getting ready to cum and I tell him to let me finish him in my mouth. He pulls out and I spin around and take his cock back in my mouth. I suck him hard and fast and he explodes in my mouth and I keeping sucking getting every drop out and swallow it all. After that he takes me back home.\n\nJustin did exactly what I thought he would do. He talked about it to Ryan and other friends as well. The next day I had a message from Ryan. Which basically \"You fucked Justin? Wtf?\" and I said \"yeah I did\", no response so I sent a message saying \"Was there something wrong with that?\" and no response.\n\nHe stopped talking to me. Heard through the grapevine that he apparently thought less of me for what I did. So I fucked up, should told Ryan how I felt from the beginning, lost him as a friend too. I don't regret it in the end. I ended up having a good time with Justin and went on to fuck him a few more times.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DirtyKIKRoleplay","subreddit_id":"t5_3kem5","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/DirtyKIKRoleplay","subreddit_subscribers":57632,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"26[F4M] I Fucked a guy in an attempt to impress another guy.

My one request is that you avoid excessive pornification. The hell does that mean, you ask? Fair question. Long story short, I like it when the woman is played closer to a human being than an actress in a porno scene. Sure, there's gonna be a whole lot of fucking, but I also like tension, conversation, seduction and foreplay. The girl knows she's hot shit and maybe even acts or talks accordingly, before or during sex. She has personality. I vastly prefer this to a woman who just instantly bends over the nearest piece of furniture and has no apparent desire or inclination beyond being ejaculated on.\r  \n\r  \nAs for the rules, no hard violence, cruelty, blood, racism, toilet stuff and the like. Light slaps\/choking, spanking, and hard drilling sex are as rough as I get. If that's too vanilla for you, we're not a match, and I wish you well.\r  \n\r  \nAs for the how\/why, we have two options: simple, and complex.\r  \n\r  \nSimple: virtual reality. Easy. The technology exists where you can play out any fantasy you like with any celebrity you can imagine. (And believe me, this will happen as soon as it's financially and technically feasible.) Perfect set-up if you're not into elaborate scenarios or you don't have a ton of time.\r  \n\r  \nComplex: why is an It Girl in her prime fucking some regular dude, who, while vaguely attractive in his own way, is not on her level? This is the tricky bit, but some possibilities include:\r  \n\r  \n\\- childhood friends who reconnect, or have stayed connected.\r  \n\r  \n\\- a heartfelt fan letter that becomes mutual correspondence, which eventually leads to a hook-up or more\r  \n\r  \n\\- winning some fan raffle for a date that starts as a publicity stunt but becomes something more in private\r  \n\r  \n\\- meeting in some work capacity where we get some time alone, and discover we have a lot of chemistry\r  \n\r  \n\\- or the common man's best friend: pure dumb luck, via a bar, club, etc.\r  \n\r  \nAs for myself, I'm 43 and married. Both my age and marital status are flexible for the RP, so long as I'm 18+. I can either be my current self or the eager college guy who first fell in love with these women, or somewhere in between. Whatever you prefer. I don't share personal pictures on here, but if you'll settle for a vague description, I'm a 6'2\"white guy who is fairly athletic (even if I've lost a step with time), with short salt-and-pepper hair and a near-permanent five o'clock shadow. Body hair in the usual places, with a fairly furry torso and a line down my stomach. I usually wear glasses, but my outfit will be based around the scenario we concoct.\r  \n\r  \nWhat you get: a reliable, responsive partner who has a lot of experience. I'm definitely looking for long-term partners if the chemistry and schedules line up.\r  \n\r  \n**General Tips On Role-Playing**\r  \n\r  \nAnd heeeeeeere comes the patronizing text! This has nothing to do with this specific prompt and can be readily ignored unless you're curious.\r  \n\r  \n**Courtesy:** Role-plays are not abstract things; they're collaborative efforts between people. The person you're writing to is, as stated, an actual person. They might be an insatiable pervert, or, in my case, a smug asshole, but they're still a human being. As such, they deserve basic courtesy and respect for their time. Ghosting (leaving an RP and never stating why or saying anything at all) is incredibly rude and amounts to turning whatever you were doing into a complete waste of time on both sides. It's no good. This is a niche section of a niche hobby; you don't have endless potential partners to burn through. If you're having issues with the story or your partner, talk it out. Countless ghosted RPs on here could've been saved with some basic communication. If there's a genuine deal-breaker, than just be honest and say so. Nobody likes giving bad news, but people generally prefer closure to just being blown off and ignored. We need to lose the attitude that the other users here are toys to be played with when we want one, then discarded when we get what we want.\r  \n\r  \n**The Hard Stuff:** I see some really dank stuff on here, up to and including snuff. I, uh, highly recommend you not do that. I hate to be the RP Police, but once you go down that rabbit hole, it can be incredibly difficult to come back out. It's easy to fall for the idea that \"it's just the Internet,\" but you don't implant a back-up brain when you go on-line. It's your regular brain, and you're training it to only respond to darker and nastier shit until it's the ONLY thing you can enjoy. That's bad enough on here, and infinitely worse when you log off and enter the real world where you won't be able to legally do any of the things you've trained yourself to crave. You don't wanna be alone your whole life because you can no longer be aroused by anything less than criminal, psychotic activity. If you need a comparison point, look at how many people have let Internet rabbit holes turn them on to weird cults, conspiracy theories and increasingly ugly fringe politics. Or for an obvious local example, look at all the prompts on here about left-leaning women getting abused, brainwashed or converted into subservient fuck dolls. These are clearly written by guys who are so obsessed with their politics that it has now taken over their fictional sex life, too. They could do anything at all in this fantasy realm, but their imagination can't expand beyond their singular sociopolitical obsession. Don't let that happen to your dick; it deserves better. Stick with vanilla and add spice when needed, so it actually means something when you go a little heavy.\r  \n\r  \n**Resist The Click:** In this little world, there's nothing more exciting than seeing a new notification light up, and feasting on the new content within. However, if you're not ready to properly write a response prompt to whatever lurks within, DON'T click the bell! I know, I know, it's super tempting and full of juicy RP goodness. But this runs the common risk of causing you to forget to respond because you go to sleep or get distracted by other things, and you wind up ghosting the other person by accident because the bell is no longer shining. (Or, even more likely, you get new notifications which occupy your attention and push the old ones even further out of your mind.) Countless RPs have died this way, which is a shame. They should die as nature intended, with both parties getting frustrated over small details and making unfounded accusations about the sexual proclivities of their partner's mother.\r  \n\r  \n**Playing, Uh, A Role:** As I stated earlier, I (and most\/all of you) don't actually know these celebrities we play as and\/or with, so it's unreasonable to expect a completely genuine performance in that regard. That said, there are still a lot of things you can do to make the role feel more real, as opposed to just playing every character the same way. Google Translate is a simple way to pepper in a little foreign language fun if it's appropriate. Even English speakers like the British and Australians have their own way of speaking and localized slang. Just adding in a pinch of that can add a lot. Referencing current or past\/future work is also great, as long as it's brought up organically.\r  \n\r  \n**\"Kinks\/Limits?\"** I would avoid this question. For one, it sounds a lot like \"A\/S\/L?\" from back in ye olde days on the Internet, which became a meme representing lazy, empty chit-chat. For another, it puts the emphasis of the RP on ticking fetish boxes rather than crafting a fun scene or story you can get lost in. Now, obviously, we're here to get off, and it's important to discuss boundaries. But I recommend keeping the story at the forefront and not just focusing on singular kinks, which can lead to similar problems to the Hard Stuff section up above. If I get asked \"kinks\/limits,\" I immediately think the person both lacks imagination and is probably just going door-to-door and hoping for a reply.\r  \n\r  \nOkay, this is veering on novella length, so I'll end it here. I'm using Reddit DMs or chat today. I look forward to hearing from you.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"CelebDPP","subreddit_id":"t5_3ggzk","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/CelebDPP","subreddit_subscribers":14186,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M4F] Nostalgic Middle-Aged Guy Looking To Have Fun With The Babes Of The 90's","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CelebDPP\/comments\/v2h1sn\/m4f_nostalgic_middleaged_guy_looking_to_have_fun\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Is this true? I can't find anything confirming this on any official website discussing either wehrpflichersatz or zivilschutz. It does confirm on ch.ch that people who are doppel UT and can't do Zivildienst, can still do Zivilschutz. But it says nothing about not having to pay wehrpflichtersatz.\n\nI'd rather ask here than at an official government institution, because I've been lied to my face by government workers before. I've been told by RAV workers that I have no claim on unemployment benefits because I had found a job that would start 1 month from then. Then I looked it up and found out I very much had a claim, as long as I kept applying for jobs within that 1 moth window. They just lied (to a 19 year old that had just ran away from home and and had no support system btw.) to save money. \n\nSo I'd honestly rather rely on you guys, because atleast you're actually here to help people.

Audible affirmations are best used when listened to during night as your mental is asleep and thus your subconscious is receptive — it's complicated to explain why but look up Dr Bruce Lipton on YouTube he explains it very well.\n\nNow how do we make it? Choose a topic, let's say you want to be 5'10 for our example. Then write your affirmations — all of these affirmations must start with “I am”, I found it to be more powerful because some sayings say we are what we say and believe we are so say “I am”.\n\nExample of affirmations:\nI am 5'10.\nI am known for my 5'10 height.\nI am constantly complimented on my 5'10 height.\nI am constantly noticed because of my 5'10 height.\nI am grateful for being 5'10.\n\nOnce you choose your affirmations, records them on your phone or anything recording devices.Do NOT speed them up, you need to be able to understand every words. Make it into a MP3 file et voilà ! \n\nListen to this recording every night until you have your results. Do not change audio every two weeks, just keep the same one until you have what you want. \n\nSTEP TWO: DAY RECORDING.\nDuring the day we'll use a subliminal. Subliminal should be used during the day as the music will distract your mental and thus the affirmations underneath will be perceived by your subconscious. \n\nHow to make your own subliminals? Like you would make any, excepts you won't used Text2speech, but instead you'll take the first recording you made in STEP ONE.\n\nThen open your editing software. You will then lower the volume of your voice recording and add music (or ambient sound as you wish) over it. You need to make sure your affirmations are low enough to only hear the presence of a voice but not hearing exactly what it says”. You can speed it a bit, but not too much so that your subconscious can understand every words. Save it into a MP3 file. Voilà !\n\nListen to it every day (NOT all day long, you need to rest as well) for an hour or so until you have your results.. Pretend it's just music.\n\nSTEP 3: YOU GOTTA DO YOUR HOMEWORK\nYou need to affirm during the day. Keep repeating yourself “I am 5'10.”, “Thanks universe for making me 5'10”. Remember, we are what we say and believe we are. By thanking and affirming, it'll be as though you already have what you want, which comes back to the law of assumption.\n\nDo these three things until you have what you want!\n\nNOTE:\nSome of y'all have horrible limiting beliefs. If you ever find yourself thinking things such as “subliminals never work on me” “i can't get any taller” “i can't manifest” make another night recording to target those negative beliefs.\n\nExample of affirmations:\n“I am constantly getting what I want.”\n“I am constantly manifesting everything I want in three days”\n“I am constantly getting incredible results from my subliminals and affirmations”\n“What I want wants me more”\n“I am capable to manifest everything and anything.”\n\nYou're welcome &lt;3\n(sorry for the mistakes English is not my native language)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Subliminal","subreddit_id":"t5_2v7bh","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Subliminal","subreddit_subscribers":58543,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":0,"thumbnail_width":0,"title":"I WANT Y'ALL TO GET RESULTS","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Subliminal\/comments\/v2h6da\/i_want_yall_to_get_results\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I've been with this current company for about three years now, and my total helpdesk experience is a few months shy of 4 years. The only certification I have is the A+, as I stopped studying for certs and focused on pursuing my degree. I'm currently in my second year in school, and I should have my AA in Computer Information Systems in May of 2023. After that, I'm transferring to a university to get my BS in Comp Sci.\n\nDespite not liking this job much, I've been with them for this long as it's had good job security with decent pay, and I work from home, which is nice. The main reason why I'm still here is the tuition assistance they provide, which has paid for all my college up until this point. \n\nBut the pain of the helpdesk has finally gotten to me, and I am looking for an out. There are a few positions internally that I'm going to apply to, but for the sake of this post, we can say that moving up internally is not an option.\n\nSuppose I wanted to pursue a new job, preferably a system admin or cloud role. What studying\/certifications would combine best with my four years of the helpdesk, and half an AA in CIS, to get me a higher-level job?\n\nI'm decently proficient and interested in Linux, and the RHSCA seems within my grasp with a few weeks of studying. I'm also very interested in Cloud and picked up a course on the AWS Solutions Architect Associates cert, which seems obtainable with a month or two of study. However, I'm not sure if that certification will be enough to net me a job.\n\nEssentially my question is: What certifications or skills will be worth picking up that can land me a sysadmin or cloud role? \n\nThank you all for your time.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ITCareerQuestions","subreddit_id":"t5_30560","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ITCareerQuestions","subreddit_subscribers":295261,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Advice on getting out of Helpdesk and moving to Sys Admin or Cloud roles","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.97,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ITCareerQuestions\/comments\/v2h8x1\/advice_on_getting_out_of_helpdesk_and_moving_to\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

He notices you and you make short eye contact, then he confidently chooses the seat in front of you. You both study for half an hour, giving short glances to each other from time to time. Then, all of a sudden, you feel something lightly touching your sandalled left foot, then again, by now you realise it's a skin to skin contact , obviously the hot guy's tips of the toes touching yours. You feel slightly turned on, and wiggle your toes in response. You notice him blushing as he soon puts his toes on top of yours and lightly presses them. You both make contact and he gives you a smirk.\n\n\nAnd my AirBnB prompt:\n\n  I am just a young guy visiting your beautiful country, that kind of guy who just finnished collage and needs a long vacation before starting the stressful routine of work life.I am 6,2 ft tall, with a round ass and rather athletic body.

Great year right! Mom and Dad never got married and he up and left when I was 8. They were both free spirited and hippyish when I was young, and I thought they were happy. I never saw them fight. He told my mom he didn’t want to be responsible anymore and took off. Mom was smart, always had a decent job. There were a few times we struggled, but not many. Mom was voluptuous and beautiful when dad left. \n\n\r  \nFast forward 9 years. I was 17, my 22 year old siter had left the house at 18 and never looked back. She married a military guy and was living in Germany. It was just me and Mom for the last 4 years. She delved into becoming a normal, responsible working mother dedicated to raising and providing for her kids. She also went from voluptuous to chubby, and I grew into a nerdy 6’1 280 really chubby depressed, picked on teenager. I didn’t really have a life. I wasn’t into sports and had only two other nerdy friends. At home I was always in my room playing Nintendo, the old computer games, or masturbating. Never had a girlfriend and can you believe it, still a virgin. Back in those days, even porn was hard to get your hands on. The Sears catalog came in real handy. Little did I know, Mom was going to save my life.\n\n\r  \nOn Mom’s 42nd birthday she went out with a couple of friends. She never really dated or did too much outside of work and taking care of us. I never really thought much of it as it was just normal for me. When Mom got home, she was a little tipsy, but not drunk. She looked at me and said, “We need to have a talk.” I thought I was in trouble as you usually are when your parent says those words, but I couldn’t think of anything I could have done wrong. My grades were halfway decent, even though I hated going to school, and I never complained about helping around the house.\r  \nMom went to the cupboard and pulled down two glasses, went to the fridge and pulled out a 2 liter of Coke and then to the cabinet and pulled out a bottle of rum. She mixed up the two glasses and handed one to me. I had never drunk any liquor in front of my mom before, so I was a bit surprised. She said, “I am going to tell you about my younger days from the time I was 18 to around 23.” I thought she was going to drop some messed up stuff on me, but she said she used to belong to a nudist club. I thought it was a bit shocking, but also kind of cool. She then went on to tell me the mindset and health benefits of being nude. I never thought about it before, so I had no idea how good it was for a person (look them up). She then asked me if I would be okay if she was nude most of the time while she was home. \n\n\r  \nNow I know she’s my mom, but I have never really seen a nude woman in real life before. I’ve naturally got glimpses of her and my sister over the years, but that’s about it. I wasn’t going to turn this down so I told her that it wouldn’t bother me. Then she said, when your comfortable, I’d like you to face your fear, and join me in being nude around the house. I was terrified, so I asked her “what if I get a boner?” She just said, “We’ll talk about that if it happens, don’t over think it.”\r  \nI don’t think I ever masturbated as much as I did that next week. I didn’t remove any clothes, but the gaming took a bigger break, that’s for sure. I hung out and watched TV, or just talked with mom. I asked if she was disappointed, I hadn’t joined her in being nude yet, but she assured me that she wasn’t. It was a big step outside of a person’s comfort zone, so it must be my decision. Week 3 I finally get the nerve to try.\n\n\r  \nI walk out of my room, I’m wearing a towel and I go out to the living room, sit on the couch and open the towel. Mom’s not there yet so I am trying to surprise her. Once she walks in, she has a big smile on her face, and of course I notice her breasts bouncing as she walks to sit next to me. Obviously, I get a boner. I get embarrassed even though mom doesn’t say anything, and I grab the towel around me, get up, and start to head to my room. I get a few steps and in her stern mom voice she says, “Charlie! Stop right there and come sit down! I said we would deal with this when it happens, and so we will.” I meekly walk back over and sit down. Mom says, “Remove the towel.” I remove the towel, but now I’ve lost my erection for the most part. She stands up and says, “Give me a hug.” I do, and as soon as I feel her breast against me, instant hard-on! Mom says with a smile, “I knew that would work. Now sit back down” She says, “Tell me the truth, I promise I won’t get upset. Are you still a virgin?” I admit that I am.  She ask’s, “Ever have anyone else give you an orgasm?” I tell her no, just me and my hand. She asks, “Would you like to change that? I ask her if she means having sex with me? Mom says, “No, I asked would you like to change the fact that no one but you has given you an orgasm?” I tell her of course I would like to change that. She asks if I would allow her to give me one. She says, “No pressure whatsoever. I know this would be a bid deal for you but know it will not be by having sex.” At this point I am a bit confused, but also very excited at the possibility of someone else playing with my dick. So, I say with a nervous squeak, “Sure”. \n\n\r  \nMom gets up, goes into her room, and comes back out with a bottle. She squirted what I now know is lube on my dick, looked me in the eye and asked, “Are you sure?” I nodded yes. She then said, “Just remember, I’m not your lover, and I’m not your girlfriend”, then she stroked my cock with a perfect grip and when I got close she cupped my balls and I had the most intense orgasm I’ve ever had at that time. I swear I shot a stream almost to the ceiling, and I kid you not it came right down on my mom’s boobs. She just laughed, and then she just sat there waiting, because she knew. After I got done shaking and reality set in, I said to my mom, “I’m sorry!”, and started to tear up. “I can’t believe I let my mom give me a hand job, I’m such a looser that I had to resort to my mom for fucks sake!” In her Mom voice, “Charlie, you knock that off right now! I’m going to let you know that what you are feeling right now is going to mean absolutely nothing in the long run of your life. Never beat yourself up for something that didn’t hurt anyone! We both consented to do something fun that we both enjoyed, and you obviously did! Just because your dick is involved doesn’t mean it’s special. Remember that! And just so you are aware, I am proud to have helped make such a nice one. You look to be just above average in length, but your girth is quite impressive. You will make some woman very happy someday. Now clean up your mess.” I’m feeling a bit better because she said I have a nice dick, but still feeling a bit uneasy I ask her, “Are you sure we’re, okay?” She smiles and says, “Of course we are. If you want, you can have one every week if you’d like. If you lose 30 pounds you can have one ever day if you’d like.” My world of possibilities just opened!\n\n\r  \nIt took a few months, but I dropped 30 pounds. Thankfully for guys, when you start doing things right, the pounds come off quickly. I held her to her word. I didn’t actually get one every day due to life happening of course, but I got them most days. Mom was also working on getting in shape over the months too. She said that being nude doesn’t allow you to ignore your bodies faults, but it does allow you to admire the parts you like. You learn to accept you, and your body. She is totally right! \r  \nOn my 18th birthday things changed a bit. I hung out with my friends most of the day and met up with Mom for dinner at the house. I immediately dropped my clothes and made my way to the dinner table. We had a good meal, and she even broke out some wine. After dinner she asked if I wanted a present or something else? I asker her what the something else was, and she replied, “I asked if you want a present or something else. You’ll have to gamble. You don’t know what the present would be either.” I took the gamble and said something else. She surprised me by grabbing me by my dick and leading me to my bedroom. She told me to lay down and said, “Remember, I’m not your lover, and I’m not your girlfriend.” With that she climbed on top of me, and her pussy brushed my dick. I thought this is it, but she leaned down and started kissing my neck and worked her way down. That was when I got my first blowjob! She swallowed every drop. I thought I was going to pass out! It was amazing! She looked at me and smiled and said, “Lose another 20 pounds and you can have one anytime you want. I’ll give you one every 3 weeks until then. Once you lose a total of 100 you get this and pointed to her pussy. \n\n\r  \nI did finally reach that 100-pound total. Its was little after I turned 19. Mom was laid out on her bed, she said, “Remember, I’m not your lover and I’m not your girlfriend, and because I was going to savor ever moment of this, I slowly entered and once I got all the way in mom started shaking! I ask if she okay, and she says, “I just had an orgasm! It’s been a long time since I had a dick in me and never one this wide!” She had one more while we fucked, and I blew my load so hard!\n\n\r  \nMom also taught me how to kiss, how to go down on a woman, and how to push the right buttons, and for 2 yeas we fucked almost every day. When I got my first girlfriend at 21 my mom said that was it, with one caveat, I could have one hand job (my birthday) one blow job (her birthday) and one fuck (Whatever day we chose) once a year. I am 52, and Mom is a healthy 77 and we haven’t missed a year.\n\n\r  \nI asked her once why she did all this, and she said, “I realized both of us were going in the wrong direction in life, and it needed to change. I was a teenager and her yelling at me to lose weight wasn’t going to motivate me. To most men between 15 and 30, and some until their in there 70’s; sex is a powerful motivator. You were heavy, insecure, not confident, and I’m assuming not very happy. Do you have any regrets?” I let her know I did not regret it at all. She saved my life, helped me turn into a healthy, fit young man confident in myself, totally confident in my sexual abilities, and more outgoing than I ever thought I would be. At 52 I am married with kids, have a great career that I enjoy, and I am extremely grateful for a loving mother that broke a social norm to help me become a good man.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"sexstories","subreddit_id":"t5_2qt19","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/sexstories","subreddit_subscribers":365159,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Mom saved me","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.94,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/sexstories\/comments\/v2hdu8\/mom_saved_me\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Making this post because i am simply craving various fandom RPs! I am 24 years old, and so expect it to eventually get into NSFW zone, BUT if you dont want to then its also fine to me, we can keep it as a more \"innocent\" romance. RP can be long or short term, but long terms are preferable since they allow us to explore more themes in it.\n\nMy pen name is \"Jin Locke\" , although obviously in RPs i will use the name of whatever character i am playing as.\n\nI cant really state the EXACT word count but as i mentioned before two full paragraphs of text or more are my preference. As for letters - i usually pass far above 1000 and it can go further and further...\n\nI prefer to play with literate RP partners who can achieve a paragraph length, and maybe go beyond that if really inspired. Sorry, but two-three sentence responses are just way too short for me to truly enjoy the RP. There is no set limit on \"max length\" but i wouldnt want you to exhaust yourself typing novellas! Just keep it comfortable but detailed.\n\nFor CanonxCanon or CanonxOC or OCxOC i dont really have a hard set preference but would enjoy at least one canon character in a pairing, since OCxOC can get a bit... vague. However i will not judge before hearing you out! By all means, message me if you have any ideas and i will be happy to hear them out.\n\nAs for genders... I guess i am on my FxF spell. I can try FxM but its a bit \"maybe\" for me and i usually only do it with a few specific kinks, so ye be warned.\n\nPlots can be discussed further in DMs, since writing it all out here for ALL the fandoms will take a few pages and i want us to talk about our preferences, kinks, themes, scenarios and whatever else we want before we start in DMs. You can still use the Chat but i like it far less then DMs.\n\nAlso you can ask me for my Discord and we can continue there if you like, which i actually prefer since Discord is far easier to track and notice fresh notifications then Reddit, which sometimes does not display them due to a bug of some kind.\n\nNow for fandoms i like (but feel free to suggest yours! I may have forgotten some \"hidden gems\" out there!): Genshin Impact, Overwatch, Fire Emblem, Zelda, DC\/Marvel, Mass Effect, Star Wars, World of Warcraft, RWBY, maybe GoT too all kinds of \"usual suspect\" anime like Naruto and etc... Fate (Grand Order and more!) , Witcher, Warframe, Assassins Creed, Dragon Age and list goes on and on...\n\nWill wait for DMs, Chats or any other form of communication. See ya!\n\nWriting sample. Here i will just try and showcase my writing style, in a more... playful way:\n\n\\*You wake up with a strange feeling of... uncertainty. You are not sure where you are, who you are or what are you doing here. Are you a famed hero of legend, a promising young apprentice or perhaps even a supernatural entity from another dimension? Nothing is certain in this land of endless grey and purple fog. You have no purpose or reason to be here, aside from being exposed to what seems like a \"sample test\" of a \"play\". But what kind of play is this? Answer alludes you, escapes your grasp like a fish in a murky water.\\*\n\n\\*You hear a chuckle coming from all around you, it reverberates endlessly until it finally stops infront of you, a sound forming into a sight - woman dressed in a frilly purple dress. You cant discern any features, and even her gender would be hard to guess if not for a distinct feeling of \"oh thats a girl\". What makes you feel this way? Perhaps merely author's nudging. Meanwhile the mysterious woman speaks, her voice carrying the same vague, echoing undetones.\\* Hello hello and welcome to \"Jin's Writing Sample\"! You are currently experiencing a healthy dose of graphomania created to demonstrate my writing skills and please the Rules of Advanced Roleplay! \\*She winks at you, and you somehow know that she did just that, despite not seeing her eyes. Or her face.\\* Of course i would love to provide a much better, more \"personal\" experience but i cant just take a chunk out of my other RP and call it a day dear... I do think RPs are so... personal, so private, it would be a bad form of me to \"desecrate\" one of my RPs by posting it for all to see. So perhaps you will enjoy this sample, and ask me for more?\n\n\\*With that, Jin curtsies , at you, then at someone behind you, and finally at her writer. The fog swirls , covering her body more and more, while your eyes grow heavy again, prompting you to succumb to the oblivion of sleep once more.
