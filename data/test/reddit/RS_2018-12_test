I am 20 year old from Russia. Okay to the theme of the post. It all started three years ago. I had a perfect GF for over a year. She was beautiful and stuff, but something happened to her. To this day i dont know what. She started acting wierd and on 31st of decemver 2015 she said to me:\"I dont want ot be your girlfriend anymore, thank you dor being so nice to me all the time, it means a lot, how about we stay friends.\". I said no to her offer and we stopped our comunication. From this moment in my life every damn thing was negative.  For over three months after breakup, as my friends were saying \"was walking without a face\". And there comes another hit from the life. In june 2016 my family cat died. After that, in december my mom sold our summer house, took all the money and divorced with my dad. There was nothing from the law side we could do to take a bit of the money, because, as far as i know she gave a lot of money to someone to make it her, and there is no proof of that. After that I became so depressed and I think a part of me died that year. I really wated to die. i said it to my friends, but instead of supporting me they said : \"if you want to die, then do it you pussy!\". and thus turned away from me.  to this day the do not want to come close to me. It was my birthday in jan of 2017  and old friend from childhood contacted me. She greeted me and insisted on meeting me. Then the whit stripe started. That was the best thing that happend to me in a while. i told her my story and she said that we must meet more often. That how the things were,she was my only friend, soulmate, idc how you call it, well things were good untill 21st of october came. It was the last time we met. We were on such level a relationship that stupid me decided to ask her out and to say her that i loved her ind i want her to be my GF. Her answer was totaly unexpected for me. She said that she would never be a GF of such a pathetic human being. she said litrally that. Other part of me died that day. And now, 1st od december the only thing that holding me from ending it all is my father. I just do not want to think about him crying. I think you know how hard it is to forget when you see on of your parents crying. Every week for me is just the same: Get up - go to university- come home- want to play some games- realize that i have no energy - cry myself to sleep- wake up. I dont know what to add anymore. Thanks for any help. Oh! And if anybody wants I will gladly try to answer any questions abot life in Russia. Again thanks for any help with my situation.

I've always struggled socially, which has inadvertently led me to bounce from warehouse job to warehouse job. I dropped out of college after about 2 years, when my stress levels seemed to just overload and I pretty much ran for the hills. I've always loved storytelling - as a matter of fact, I don't remember a time when I didn't enjoy writing. I've always enjoyed drawing as well (I'm not great, but I'm ok), and to make a long story short, both of these interests seemed to converge in high school where I discovered a love for filmmaking. The thing is, I think the desire has always been there. My friends were always floored with how much I knew about movies, whether it be the actors in the movies, the year they were made, what it was based on, who directed it, etc etc. When I watch a film with someone, and I revere that film pretty greatly, I always look to see how that person reacts to the scenes I consider the best. After dropping out of college, I kind of shut down. I've been prescribed several antidepressants, counseling, the works. None of it ever seems to do the trick.\n\nI had an epiphany moment recently, where I pretty much grabbed myself by the shoulders and asked, \"What the FUCK are you doing?\" For 8 years I watched time just pass by. For the past month or so, I've been reading extensively on the process of filmmaking, (illegally) watched a Master Class with Martin Scorsese, not to mention a slew of YouTube videos with both directors I consider idols, and amateurs providing a great deal of knowledge on what it takes to steer a film. I've written a couple of screenplays, drawn the storyboards, and bought some equipment (lights, shotgun mic, gimbal, tripod, wide-angle lens) to use with the only camera I can afford, which is my IPhone 6s. I dropped $25 for the Filmic Pro app along with the Cinematographer's Kit, and it's honestly a pretty great thing for someone who can't afford a high end dslr at the moment. The thing is, when I'm doing all of these things - writing, test shooting, editing, etc - I feel like I can take on the world. The courage and drive it gives me is staggering. I genuinely feel purpose.\n\nI know, all of that was extremely unnecessary, I apologize for rambling. I think I just really needed to get that out. So without any further nonsensical exposition, I'll get to the point.\n\n1st question: should I be utilizing the log mode function on the Filmic Pro app for all of my shots, both interior and exterior, even in low light? I plan to have someone color grade my scenes in post btw. Something I've read is that it's a good idea to overexpose by a notch or two, does that apply even to the Filmic Pro app? Like if an ISO of 260 looks good in natural mode, should I set it to about 262 for log? How does flat mode compare to log, is it just a less extreme version of the latter?\n\n2nd question: Is video noise unavoidable? I find that noise is even more pronounced when using log or flat mode. Is it just something you aim to minimize as much as you can while filming and clean up the rest in post?\n\nIf it sounds like I'm clueless on camera settings, it's because I partially am lol. I think I might also be a bit of a perfectionist, probably to a fault. I've got the picture in my head, but I'm trying to learn how to best extract that picture and apply it, so any help at all would be greatly appreciated from anyone with a better grasp than myself of the technical aspects of filmmaking.

I called the debt collector, who is a legit company and not a scam artist. They informed me that I am defaulting on three Federal Direct Unsubsidized Student Loans. I informed them that this is the first time I was ever aware of these loans let alone that I am allegedly defaulting on them\n\nThey informed me the cost for the loans plus the interest is $25,500 the debt collector company added $6500 in late fees onto it, despite this being my first notification from them, in any form (IE Phone or Email) on these loans. I WAS NEVER GIVEN ANY BILL ON THESE LOANS BEFORE THIS POINT. They gave me the dates, loan numbers, and disbursement amounts to the loans. Which go as follows (information has been changed on them for this post, if they don\u2019t add up to the specific amount that is why)\n\nMay 2013-$8700\n\nJanuary 2014-$8700\n\nJanuary 2015-$8600\n\nI informed them that I am disputing these charges and will not be making any payment until I am given further information.  They told me to contact the federal government department of education to get more information. \n\nTo summarize thus far, I was made aware for the first time in January of 2018 that I am defaulting on $25,500 worth of student loans with $6500 worth of late fees added, despite this being my first ever notice on these loans. The loans are from 2013, five years prior. I have absolutely no recognition of ever taking out these loans. I talked to my parents and they do not either. I wouldn\u2019t have signed up for $25,000 worth of loans unless they told me too and guided me to ensure no mistakes were made, and they would not have taken them out in my name without telling me. **No one has any idea how these loans came to be.**\n\n**Part 2: The Confusing Part**\n\nI called the US Department of ED and they told me the debt collection company has all the information now and they will not assist me due to not making payments to them. I then contacted my old University to inquire about this. They gave me access to the student portal again to see what loans were paid to the school and when. Now this is where it all gets very confusing.\n\nI reviewed the loan information paid to my school and none of the information matches what was given to me by the debt company. The disbursement dates are in the same month, but do not match the exact dates given. The loan numbers, and disbursement amounts do not match either. What was paid to the school is below. Please note these are the only federal loans paid to my former school. (Again information was changed here)\n\nActually Paid                                   What I was told was Paid \n\n5\/2013-$3200                                    May 2013-$8700\n\n5\/2013- $3200                                 January 2014-$8700\n\n11\/2013- $3700                                January 2015-$8600\n\n12\/2014-$3700\n\n1\/2015-$3700\n\nTOTAL: $17,500                                    Total: $27,000\n\n**I do not know if my student portal only shows loans I took out that were paid to them or if it shows all loans paid to the school.** I left the university that these were paid too in 2015. But the amounts are drastically off. \n\n**Part 3: What I have done so far to fight\/protect myself**\n\nWith this new information in hand, I filed a fraud alert on my credit score across Equifax, Trans-union, and Experian.  I called the debt company and informed them that I wanted a copy of the promissory note. They said they would give one in a few weeks, but it never came. I called them repeatedly to request information and state that I am still disputing it because the information given does not coincide to what was actually paid and that they needed to provide me with a burden of proof. **MONTHS WENT BY** without any word from them on this or the status of my promissory note. \n\nA family friend, who is a lawyer, but does not specialize in student loan or finances, helped me out. He was kind enough to use his law firm\u2019s stationary to \u201crepresent me\u201d and request the same information that I had, IE the Promissory Note. They finally sent ONLY AFTER HE REQUESTED IT. only after he requested it. \n\nThe Promissory note has my name, address, D.O.B, Drivers license number, and Social Security Number listed on it. It has my dad and grandmother (who has since passed away, not sure if this is relevant) listed as references. It is dated exactly two weeks before the first disbursement date that the debt collector provided me. However, I again have no recollection of ever filling out this document, but again 5 years has passed so my memory could be fuzzy here.\n\nMonths had passed at this point and the government kept my federal tax refund because of the debt I owed. I called the debt company again and told them the promissory note does not provide any additional information and I will not be paying until they can provide more info IE a burden of proof.  They told me to call the US Department of Education. I told them when I call US Department of ED they tell me to call the debt company. I informed them until they can provide additional evidence I will not be paying. \n\n**Part 4: Where I am at now**\n\nThis whole thing has been dragged out almost a year, due to a rough break up, changing jobs, and changing cities where I live. The debt company took their time getting any info to me and always claims to never have any additional information.  \n\nThe repercussions of these loans are slowly ruining my life. It is tacked onto my credit score, which is horrible due to this. I am not able to refinance the student loans I took out through a third party like Sallie Mae, Navient, or Wells Fargo. I have a hard time getting an apartment as well.\n\nAt this point I have no clue what I should do. **The loan amounts, dates, and disbursements do not coincide to what was paid to my school. I was never made aware of this, until $6500 worth of late fees were added on.And I have no recollection of ever signing the promissory note.**\n\nI have nowhere near the $32,000 needed to get this all paid off and off my credit score. I am 25 years old and work in sales and make about $63,000 a year before taxes, but I pay for my own apartment, car, have my other student loans amongst expenses, etc. it would take me years to pay this off, on top of the student loans I already have through a third party. All the meanwhile these will be attached to my credit score which it will slowly keep ruining. My family does not have the money needed either, and I don\u2019t know how I could ask them to take it out of retirement and work out a payment plan with them.\n\nI just want this whole nightmare to finally end and be off my credit score. It is an enormous burden, and I have no idea what to do right now. I am looking any actual legal advice that I can take to fight this and make it go away.  If you have any actual advice on what I can please let me know. This is my last hope before I call the company one last time to figure out what it would mean to fight it and what sort of payment plan I would be stuck on. If you have any actual advice on what I can please let me know, thanks for your time. \n\nSUMMARY: Debt collector sent me a bill for $32,000 worth of federal student loans I have no recollection of ever signing up for.

I found a little gem of a Gif over on a Hypnosis subreddit a while ago and...well...it got the wheels in my mind turning and the ideas began to go spark. So much so that I felt like I needed to play this out with someone or someones. Yes, I'm looking for men too. Specifically, subby men who like to please or enjoy a fair bit of cuckolding and feminization.\n\nWhat I was thinking is that I play a dominant that the two of you come across online. You two are curious but willing to try anything at least once. So, I send you two a little video of what exactly I can do. Little do you know that this video is a training video to turn you into my cute little obedient slaves. And, once you've watched it, you have no other pleasure in the world than my voice. My touch. My control. \n\nI'm fine with other scenarios as well. Maybe you're siblings or related in some way? Maybe you're friends looking for some relaxation guide and stumble on me. Maybe the two of you know exactly what you're getting yourself into, finally taking the plunge and becomings someone's hypnotized sex toys. Or maybe we're just a bunch of gamers that never meet in person, and I send you two a video to turn you into my personal HealSluts. The possibilities are endless and open on this one. \n\nNote: You don't actually have to be a couple or be in a relationship to play this out. However, you do get bonus points if you are. You can also get points for playing a lesbian couple\/sisters\/two females in general, for being both taller than me (I'm 5'3\"), or being an interracial couple. I also have a few pictures from the artist I can show you for some other prompt ideas. \n\n-----------------------\n\n[Oh Hey! I have a Kinkslist now.

Travelling soon, 6+ months  SE Asia. Also freelancing artist on the side. What do with $ ?? \n\n**Background:**\n\nI've been living on my own since 18, and had been working a high paying Shipper\/Receiver job for about 3 years. I knew that lifestyle wasn't for me from the get-go, so I've been learning Concept Design\/Illustration\/Digital Art for the last 3 years in any free time I had. (Art is bad-ass, the thing I most enjoy spending my time doing, and my goal right now is to eventually work as a freelance Concept Artist\/Illustrator)\n\nI was living alone in a small studio apartment and paying around $2000\/mo to live (Canada). Things weren't great at work, and I was constantly stressed, tired, and feeling like trash. I decided about 6 months ago I needed to leave. I felt I'd like to travel and\/or put *way* more time into improving my skills. I knew I wanted to be making art full time, and needed a plan that best put me on a path to progression. \n\nI decided I'd quit my job, travel + reduce my monthly living costs by moving to SE Asia for 6+ months, study my ass off during that time and start freelancing ASAP. I know, it probably seems like a crazy idea, it may not be all that responsible, but it also makes a lot of sense to me. I get to travel and expand my mind, spend tons of time studying art, and live far cheaper than I can here in Canada. Ex. $2000 CAD gets me a single month here, or nearly 3+ months in a place like Chiang Mai.\n\nI quit my job, moved out of my apartment, and reduced my possessions down to a single backpack (props to r\/onebag). I would have been leaving for SE Asia tomorrow, but when I left my job and told my parents my plan, my father graciously offered to let me live with them until I leave. I'm extremely grateful for that. It gives me lots of time to plan, study, and get ready for the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**That takes me to right now:**\n\nMy plan is I'll be flying into Bangkok in 2 months, making my way to Chiang Mai, and get an apartment for a month or two and decide what to do from there. As I said above, I plan on starting to freelance while I travel to help negate my costs and keep my savings up. (I've also recently set up a Society 6 page where I sell random illustrations I do. Made a couple sales already! Woohoo!) \n\nSo, now that's out of the way, some details on my current situation: \n\n* I'm living with almost no costs until I leave in late January\n* I have a paid off '04 VW Golf that's probably worth no more than $5000. I can thankfully keep that at my parents for the time being. Currently insured. Id like to leave it with them while i'm away, uninsured.\n* Everything else I own fits inside a backpack, and is maybe valued at $3000 total. (Laptop + Camera is most of that) \n* I have $27,000 in savings \n* I have \\~$400 in Cryptocurrency. (#Hodl) \n\nI also have payable pension benefits of $10,450.64. So I can either: \n\na) Get a cash refund, subject to 20% withholding tax\n\nb) Get a direct transfer to a RRSP, or another RPP,\n\nc) Cash refund of $xx, subject to withholding tax, and a transfer of the remaining to a RRSP or RPP. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as upcoming expenses:\n\nI'll spend about $700-$900 on my plane ticket\n\nI figure i'll need about $800 or less per month to live in Chiang Mai. (So i'll keep at least $5000 free after my plane ticket is purchased? How would I go about accessing that money in Thailand?)\n\nThat's about it. So, where I'm at right now; what's are some wise choices I can make to get the most out of my money? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My main questions:**\n\nDo I put that 10K into a RRSP? \n\nDo I invest some of my 27k instead of it all sitting in one account? \n\nShould I get multiple accounts in case one gets compromised while travelling?\n\nAs a Canadian, are there any good options for credit cards, or other useful things that I can take advantage of? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading all of this, I tried to be as thorough as possible. If anyone can give me some ideas on what I should do it'd be greatly appreciated!! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/personalfinance","subreddit_subscribers":13523227,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I'm 21, I have $27,000 CAD saved.

I should bulk myself up, make myself not look like this. \n(This isn't me this is an actor\/model, but this is an example of how I currently look. My hair is currently in an afro like this model. )\n\n* https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/4a\/af\/4e\/4aaf4e8c1a5ec56a8217ca506c6963c4.jpg\n\nHe wants me to look like this I guess. \n\n* https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/6f\/11\/32\/6f11326b2c7dc54126197604660d7746.jpg\n\nOkay, not only is that bullshit, and it's also a very damaging, trite, superficial suggestion and advice to give, but playing devil's advocate let me agree with that. Okay. \n\nFirst of all. I do keep in shape. Just because I'm attracted to chubby guys, doesn't mean I don't like fitness. I don't go to the gym no. No offense to guys that do go. Some guys like the gym and that's lovely. I don't. I go to the park, the beach, and do my own routine. I like to put on my headphones and jog and take walks and do jazzercise I guess? lol. Like breakdancing, hip hop dance, and tumbling and stretching. \n\nBut I have zero interest in weightlifting or muscle building. I find hulky and bulky guys like that okay, but that's just not my thing. \n\nBut for the hell of it, let's say I did transform my body into that. Now what? So I'm still a feminine flamboyant egotistical guy mentally, that because he wanted to conform to be liked and accepted and to get dick (possibly did steroids, but I'm gonna shut my mouth lol.) is now a muscle god adonis. So it's all still a facade. \n\nI wouldn't be happy with that at all. I'd rather still be my natural self. Than to transform and morph myself into a body I only want to be accepted. So they are only attracted to me because of my new body? Looks are not everything. Case in point, with my particular type. I know that most gay guys don't find Louis CK attractive. That's fine. He's not the most pretty looking man. But I'm attracted to him, and that's all that matters. That's such bullshit. \n\n***I'm not talking about guys who are athletes by occupation, or enjoy lifting and building muscle as a hobby. Or want to work as physical trainers etc.  That is what you call an exception to the rule. So stop.***\n\nHe's also missing the point. Yeah guys with muscles are nice, but I'm attracted to more natural looking guys. To me it's really easy to tell the guys that gain their body because that's what they want to do, versus the ones that were twinks that were tired of being called fag, so they went to the gym and started to lift. Smh.\n\nFinally, where does it end?\n\nOkay by that logic, why don't I just get plastic surgery and get an nose job. Bleach my skin. etc. You see. etc. It's a never ending cycle that never stops. \n\nNot everyone wants to conform.

I've had echocardiograms, 24hr Holter monitor, ecg tests, etc - all show that my heart is perfectly healthy and functuonal. This has kept me at bay but every time anxious, it makes my heart beat faster which spirals me into a completely unreasonable fear of sudden heart attack.\n\n\nNow I've been dealing with depression for a number of years and find it difficult to leave the house some days. Due to this, I've fallen into a very seditary lifestyle. I also work from home so am infront of the computer all day... I went to the DRs not long ago with high anxiety and got a pretty high blood pressure reading. I was incredibly stressed at the time as well. This prompted the Dr to get me on a 24hr blood pressure monitor which showed much more normal numbers. The problem is, every time I go back in, I have anxiety episodes about my BP minutes before the doc takes a reading. \n\n\nI went in on Monday just to get some antibiotics, in the waiting room I again thought about the BP results and went into panic mode. 5 minutes later I was in his office and he sprung it on me that he was going to take a test. It was high again and I can't convince myself that I'll be okay if I just get out more and eat better - not to mention the fact that the anxiety will be raising the reading quite substantially. I mentioned all of this to the dr and he again said it's likely a lot higher than the actual normal pressure because of the anxiety but I do need to exercise more and eat less sodium just to be safe. I cannot get it to sink in that HBP is completely treatable, even without meds, and only poses serious potential harm in the long term if untreated.\n\n\nI've been spiraling ever since. I've been obsessively exercising and checking my pulse all week. Yesterday I forced myself to walk way too much and completely exhausted myself. Multiple panic attacks with little energy to sustain myself at night that left me terrified, shaking and in tears.\n\n\nI f**king hate this so much. I just want to be healthy mentally and physically but it feels like the mental side is contributing to the physical side and it's a gigantic endless loop.\n\n\nI took my resting heart rate today when I was feeling very calm and relaxed and it was at 58. You'd think that's help me realise that I'm in decent cardiovascular shape, but no, 2bpm under the average resting range made my brain go into overpower thinking it wasn't operating well enough and I'm on the verge of a heart attack.\n\n\nI'm just so sick of this. I was so confident as a teenager, now I'm 26 and I can't deal with crowds, the feeling of my own heart beating or phone calls. I feel like an absolute wreck. I want to take a holiday somewhere but I'm so terrified that something will happen while I'm out of phone range or not near a hosptial that I just can't. Even when I'm exercising I stick to main roads just in case something happens, so people will see me and help.\n\n\nThis is constantly on my mind, from the very second I wake up to the hours that it keeps me awake at night in bed. I feel incapable of relaxation or enjoyment of life because of how constantly terrified I am. \n\n\nThis isn't how I pictured myself when I was younger. I just wish I could go back to being the life of the party rather than being so isolated these days that I have absolutely 0 contact with my old friends and haven't in years. I can barely talk to people without wanting to get out of the situation as fast as possible and I'm constantly obsessing over unrealistic health concerns.\n\n\nSorry for the long post and thank you if you took the time to read all of that. My girlfriend is my absolute rock and she us unbelievably supportive as she suffers from depression and anxiety herself, I don't think I would've made it out of the panic attacks last night if she didn't just hold me until I couldn't hold it back anymlre and started crying. I can't describe the emence feeling of releif once I had let it all out. The only problem is, it's started up all over again this morning and I have the same pulling sensation in my throat that I did before it really hit yesterday. \n\n\nLuckily enough, what I lack in non internet based friends, is absolutely made up by my gf, mum and work colleagues for being so understanding and legitimately helpful. I opened up to my work about my anxiety, turns out everyone that I work with knows someone very close to them with a severe anxiety disorder and actually understands it. It's a small company.\n\n\nEven with all of this positivity, I can't help feeling like I'm a burden and I keep it back from people until I cant hold it in anymore. The most stulid thing about it is the unrealistic expectations that I hold myself to that I wouldn't ever dream of holding another guy to. I'll be the first one to tell other guys my age that it's okay to cry and show your feelings and that no one will judge them for it. As soon as it applies to myself, it's the opposite - \"I'm a guy I can't be such a pussy. What kind of man am I? Don't cry or you'll expose yourself for being weak\". Absolutely toxic thoughts that are beyond ridiculous. I really relate to the typical older male that doesn't show his feelings and gets angry whenever someone brings then up on TV shows (like Frank in Everybody Loves Raymond when Ray tells the story of him affectionately patting a bunny). I wish I could stop it but I just can't. I don't know why it only applies to myself, if I see another dude crying all I want to do is go see if he's okay, I wouldn't judge him for a second.\n\n\nI thought I was finished when I said thank you above, but I guess I wasn't - pretty accurate insight into my mental space at the moment though.. I guess I'll leave it at this. I'm sure there are thousands of people all over the world just like me, its just hard to convince myself I'm not an outcast. \n\n\nThanks again for reading, I'm going for a walk.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Anxiety","subreddit_id":"t5_2qmij","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Anxiety","subreddit_subscribers":226075,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Unrealistic self expectations, Social and Health Anxiety - just need to vent..","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Anxiety\/comments\/a1yjmb\/unrealistic_self_expectations_social_and_health\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

I think that Zuras and Alars will be brothers and each have a son - Starfox and Thanos.\n\nElysius: In the comics she's a kree robot made by a robot. She's the mother of Phyla-Vell and Genis-Vell. In the movies I think they'll just straight up make her the first Quasar.\n\nGilgamesh: There's a place for him in the first story. He's a rebel Eternal who got his name stripped away from him for running away. \n\nKaren: Possibly a stand-in for Margo, the human POV character\n\nPiper: Possibly a stand-in for Sprite, the evil little kid that wants attention\n\nDruig: The Satan-Like villain.\n\nZuras: The King of Eternals a.k.a Prime Eternal who rules over which Eternals get to breed\n\nThena: Zuras' daughter who inherits the throne \n\nMakkari: Thena's right hand man and eventual lover to Sersi. A speedster.\n\nSersi: The Eternals that prefers to party with humans than spend time with the rest of the Eternals.\n\nIkaris: The powerhouse of the team, also ends up inheriting the throne.\n\nSo\n\nFirst movie: Given that Druig, Gilgamesh and Piper were listed I think the first Eternals story will loosly be based on Gaiman's run, the Knauf run and the Gillis run. I think they'll borrow the Eternals \"waking up\" plot from the Gaiman run and Piper being the one that made themm all forget, Druig being the big bad from both the Gaiman and Knauf run and Gilgamesh working for the enemy the entire time until it's revealed he was spying for the Eternals. Also Zuras dies here and Thena becomes the Queen because we've already seen 2 franchises with King and it's gonna get stale. Druig can also wake up other Eternals if I remember the storylines correctly.\n\nSecond movie: Introduces the Deviants. Inspired by the Kirby and Knauf runs. The Deviants rise up and the Eternals want to stop them. The Deviants just want to be free and individualistic but they have to fight for it since the Eternals want to fuck them up each time. Ikaris spends his time taking tracking them down. Nobody shows up for Thena when she's on the throne and she slowly starts loosing faith in the Eternals and teams up with her Deviant lover Kro. The Eternals see this as blasphemy and want to track them down, but by the end Thena ears her place as the rightful Queen unlike the comics where Ikaris was a giant dick. Movie mostly focused on the Deviant vs. Eternal Ideologies and fates.\n\nThird movie: whilst the war is still going on the Celestials come down to judge the Earth. This movies is most heavily inspired by the original Kirby run where the same thing happened. The Eternals end up being spread out between trying to stop the Deviants, stopping both Deviants and Humans from interfering with the Celestials because if they get attack the Earth is destroyed, trying to get the Celestials off Earth and Fighting off Druig again. They stop the Celestials using the Uni-Mind.\n\nSome cool moments I'd like to see happen:\n\n1. Sersi totally not giving a fuck about the Eternals stuff, instead just partying away with humans. But eventually she ends up with Makkari (I know it's rumored that the first movie is gonna deal with her and Ikaris' romance which I hate as a concept)\n\n2. Sersi saving a suicidal dude and turning his life around.\n\n3. Karkas, a Deviant, joining the Eternals and Ikaris giving him the \"You may be a Deviant in body, but you have an Eternals soul\" speach. They form a bond and Karkas ends up being the only one with Ikaris when he has to bury Margo\/Karen's dead body.\n\n4. Pre-transformation Makkari being a doctor, Sersi a party planner, Thena a scientist that gets hired by Stark, Zuras a random drunk, Druig a russian ambassador etc.\n\n5. Ikaris fighting a disguised Deviant in a boxing match \n\n6. The Uni-Mind being built up and used in the final movie against the Celesetials\n\n7. Thena having a romance with a Deviant\n\n8. The iconic scene set a million years ago when the Celestials came down in the First Host to create Deviants\/Eternals\/Humans \n\n9. Maybe Hercules and Sersi joining the Avengers? They spend the most time among the humans anyway. Technically Gilgamesh does too, but not as much.\n\nSome things that need to be fixed:\n\n1. I want Thena on the throne immediately, and I do not want Ikaris taking the throne away from her because she fell in love with a Deviant. As I said, having another King role in the MCU is gonna get stale. I would have kept Zuras outside the whole Eternals story but since he's listed in the cast he's probably gonna play a role for at least the first act.\n\n2. Ikaris desperately needs a good character depiction. He's the lead character of every Eternals book yet he's the dullest, most boring character. Him with Margo, great, but there's barely any scenes of that. He's just a cliche powerhouse character. Oh yeah he also got the name Ikaris because of his dead son Icarus which is basically just the myth, and after he's reminded of that he starts forgetting about Margo, which leads to her getting captured and killed by the Deviants.\n\n3. Sersi easily being the stand-out star, eventually becoming an Avenger. She's easily the best Eternal in the comics because of her attitude, her outgoing, optimistic but incredibly sassy and sarcastic personality. I don't want that character going away just to be replaced as Ikaris' love interest.\n\n4. Makkari also getting some more spotlight. In the comics he's probably the only speedster whose speed matters. He constantly has to calculate how fast he has to carry people to not hurt them, how to stop bullets without grabbing them etc. He's also Thena's right hand man.\n\n5. Zuras is another cliche OP character. And I do not want to see him having more than 20 minutes of screentime because he's basically just another Odin. \n\n6. Druig being more complex. He's not TOO bad in the comics, but they should really come up with a compelling story for him. I don't want a \"agh Thena's on the throne, I'll have none of thaaaat\" story. I kinda liked him being a Russian warlord, maybe do that. I keep forgetting, his powerset is also really fun. He's basically an evil version of Karnak, being able to see weak spots in everyone\n\n7. Piper, if she ends up being Sprite, also being more complex outside of \"Ugh I'm 11 but I think I'm more mature than I actually am, people need to give me more attention\"\n\n8. The characters being waaaaaay powered down. I'm fine with the superstrengths and immortality, but for example Sersi can just rearrange molecules into whatever she likes, even living beings. Ikaris, you literally can't do anything to him, like nothing at all hurts or kills him. There's a comic where he's literally blasted until just his electrons are left and he still manages to come back. \n\nHonestly the Eternals as characters are all pretty boring which is probably why they never really got that popular even tho their story concepts are actually really fun. Sersi is the fan favorite and rightfully so given her fun popularity and long time on the Avengers. Thena got more depth during the second run with the DEviant romance. Makkari got kind of fixed during the Gaiman run. However none of the other Eternals have very little depth to them, ESPECIALLY the lead character.\n\nAlso, their history is wonky as fuck. Kirby originally didn't even want them connected to the Marvel Universe and his run ended up getting cancelled by issue 18 which sucked. You can see reading through that run that he had grand ideas and he hadn't even finished setting everything up on the board before it got cancelled. The run would have probably lasted good 50 issues with the amount of history he created during those 18 issues. There were so many unresolved plots that are still being solved to this day by other writers. Also Gaiman did a big number on their stories, he basically kinda nerfed them and made them all more connected to humans which was a welcome change because it made them more grounded and reletable.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Marvel","subreddit_id":"t5_2r40o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Marvel","subreddit_subscribers":470798,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I think, using the supposed cast list for Eternals, I can figure out the plots for the trilogy of movies.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Marvel\/comments\/a1ynp1\/i_think_using_the_supposed_cast_list_for_eternals\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I am 17 years old, and am currently PIMO. I live with my brother (PIMI) and my dad (PIMI). My dad is EXTREMELY strict and controlling, and sometimes gets abusive. He has turned away almost all of his family. My mom left around two years ago (I no longer talk to her, because of the way she left), one of my sisters (19, \u201cnot past the bloom of youth\u201d), moved out because my dad wouldn\u2019t support her dating at 19. And finally, two weeks ago, my other sister moved out because she had a worldly boyfriend. A little more about me: I started attending community college when I was 15, and will graduate with an associate of arts degree at the same time I graduate high school. Not to brag, but I get good grades, and I am extremely motivated when it comes to school. I want to be a doctor (I WILL become a doctor), and I am also gay. It took me a long time to mentally remove myself from the religion, but now I just want to leave. Its Friday night and I am sitting here in my bedroom, depressed, doing nothing, which happens every night, because I hate anyone that\u2019s a JW and I can\u2019t have worldly friends. That being said, I have like two friends from school I occasionally do things with, but even when I do i can\u2019t enjoy myself because I\u2019m worried that the lie\/excuse I told my dad (I usually tell him I\u2019m working on a group project) will fall through, and he will find out. And he\u2019s already suspicious of me, my brother told me, because of all the time I\u2019m away from home. That means I can\u2019t do too much, I can go out maybe once every few weeks. But I am SO SICK of living like this. I wanna be out of the closet, I wanna go out on Friday nights, I wanna be normal so bad. I wanna celebrate the holidays, and have a boyfriend I can post pictures with. Now, I turn 18 on April 4th. You\u2019re probably thinking \u201cthat\u2019s only around 4 months away\u201d. And you\u2019re right, but that\u2019s too long. And even then, I work a minimum wage job part time, and I can\u2019t afford to move out. So then I would wait until college. I recently got accepted to the university of Minnesota to major in biology, my favorite subject (which should have been a happy moment, but it wasn\u2019t, because I had no one that cares about me enough to be excited with me or tell the news to). I will probably stay on campus, but that means I can\u2019t move out until September. And who knows if that will work. Who wants a roommate who is just coming from a cult and has experienced nothing, with a shit ton of childhood trauma?? No one. The other day we had a shepherding, and of course they asked me my spiritual goals, and I made up \u201cto get baptized\u201d, and now my dad wants to study the Bible teach book. Lately I\u2019ve been working every Saturday to get out of the ministry, but my dad literally started keeping my attendance, and screams at me all the time about it. But it\u2019s like 4 days of my week are dedicated to \u201cspiritual things\u201d and I can\u2019t stand it.So in conclusion, i guess I just have all these dreams and new things I want to experience, and typical things I wanna do. But I can\u2019t. And I don\u2019t want to spend more time wasting my life away sitting in my bedroom because my dad won\u2019t let me have friends. So I\u2019m just looking for advice.\nThanks!\n\n*sorry if this is confusing or there are parts I seemed to leave out, but I just typed what came to my head.\nAnd no, I don\u2019t have any close worldly friends or relatives to stay with","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"exjw","subreddit_id":"t5_2qp5l","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/exjw","subreddit_subscribers":31451,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"What should I do","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/exjw\/comments\/a1ysaj\/what_should_i_do\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

My family has owned a farm for 6 generations, my dad runs it right now. Keep in mind it's only an agricultural farm, no livestock. I'm the only boy out of my siblings. Neither of them like farming, my older sister is in college to be a teacher, and my younger one hates being outside. I have helped out on the farm for my summers, because easy work, and I know my dad knows I enjoy working with computers. I don't really enjoy working with tractors, I enjoy working with him, so if I did go to work at the farm, I'd only enjoy it when he was there. He keeps telling me to do what I enjoy, but he has also said stuff at certain places (that I don't want to work at) \"You know, if you worked here, I wouldn't require you to work at the farm.\" Also, if I don't go to work at the farm and he retires, he'd have to hire someone else to manage the place, and the fact that that kills the 6 generation timeline we have makes me feel obligated to work there. What do you guys think I should do? Should I pursue one of my interests with creating things on computers or send the rest of my life managing a large farm?\n\nEdit: I should mention my dad hates technology and tries to keep the farm as simple as possible, so making computers more integrated with the farm would take alot of convincing before the work.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjdm","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Advice","subreddit_subscribers":207037,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Should I work at the farm?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/a1yzpj\/should_i_work_at_the_farm\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Hello. I've been trying to stop drinking for years. I'm able to go short spells without it but then I always start back up. The longest I ever went was 3 months. I actually only drink once or twice a week. But one day a week I ALWAYS drink to excess. Big time binge &amp; usually on an empty stomach. I can't stop until it's too late &amp; my head is spinning. I hardly ever recall half of what I do while intoxicated. And that scares me but obviously not enough to stop. I have entire conversations on the phone with family members &amp; not remember it until they tell me.\n\nEven having persistent esophagitis, ulcers, mild pulmonary hypertension, &amp; neurological issues doesn't stop me from that one day a week awful binge. The next day I always hate myself, sink into blues &amp; then a week later do the same thing again. Did I mention I drink alone? Last night I had a bottle of wine followed by 8 or 9 beers. All alone on my porch. I'm a loner though, I prefer it. And I'm fine with that because being around people for too long zaps my energy levels, drains me big time. \n\nNothing I try works to stop drinking for good. Every heightened emotion I have makes me want to drink. Good or bad. Nothing else gives me the serene feeling I get from drinking. I've tried replacement hacks, self help guides, apps, holistic therapy, etc. Nothing I've done so far works. I don't know what to do &amp; I need to stop. One day I might end up hurting myself &amp; be too drunk to realize it. I in fact got a concussion once after hitting my head while drunk. That only stopped me from drinking for exactly one month.\n\nI live in a state where drinking is a core part of our culture. I'm constantly surrounded by it. I'm considering moving. I want to be healthy &amp; happy &amp; the alcohol cravings to go away. I used to drink every single night for 23 years. I'm 44 now. And sometimes I would indeed binge but not like I do now.  For the past year it's been the once or twice a week. It's like I'm doing enough drinking in one night to make up for the rest of the week I didn't drink.\n\nI have many soothing hobbies. I eat healthy, take vitamins, exercise daily, meditate....None of which helps stop the alcohol cravings. I wish I could find inner peace, ways to feel tranquil without using alcohol to accomplish that. \n\nWell I guess I'm done rambling. Thanks for reading. Hoping this forum can help. This is me trying again. Hopeful first day of sobriety.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stopdrinking","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7yr","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/stopdrinking","subreddit_subscribers":152479,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"First Day (I hope)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/stopdrinking\/comments\/a1z6d1\/first_day_i_hope\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

I am 21 and a Female my brother is about to turn 20 and our little sister is 5 (I did not ever get enough courage to ask why but my parents decided to reverse my father vasectomy and have a baby when I was 16.) \n\n   My brother and I have always been close other than the usual sibling rivalry and bickering we have been more like friends than siblings especially when we got into highschool. When Michael was a freshman I was a sophmore and we ended up having the same friend group which made us that much closer. All the girls at school always thought Michael was cute and he truly is plus his personality is amazing but he never really made any moves on the girls we hung out with. On my prom night he went with my best friend and at the after party when everyone was getting ready for bed and starting to hook up I took my boyfriend upstairs and my friend took Michael downstairs so I figured that he got laid like everyone else. Turns out as she told me that he fingered her and went down on her but never got naked and said he was going to get sick when she tried to take it that extra step. After that night a part of me always thought he might be gay either way I never asked him because he would be mortified that she told me all that she did. \n\n   Fast forward to now he just started college after taking a year off and is now going to where I have been going, our parents said that if we wanted to move out then they would get us an apartment but that is the only way they would be comfortable if we both moved out (and I know my dad especially is more worried about me living alone) but I was happy with that arrangement I've lived with him for this long may as well make it a few years more. \n\n   I have never been one that was shy about sex or sexuality and that could not be any further away than what Michael is. I lived as a goth lesbian for a few years because why not but when the first cute boy asked me on a date and my girlfriend didn't want to go with us I broke up with her and realized that I was neither a lesbian nor a goth. After a year of college and growing up on the internet in the age of fast free porn at your finger tips I learned I was not just one thing I found out that an array of things tickled my fancy when it came to sex and the one that made me feel the weirdest because I was very turned on by was the Incest boom on the tube sites. After learning about this interest I came here and never really fantasized about anyone in my family at all but the taboo of reading about some of these stories really peaked my interest. \n\n   It was Halloween night when the first thing happened that lead me to this sub for something other than material to get me going. I was getting out of the shower going to get ready for this party my brother and I were going to at this frat house but when I was walking to my room from the bathroom I noticed he was playing xbox on the couch in basketball shorts and a tee shirt. I walked in and sat on the couch (sectional couch so I was almost directly across from him) I was wearing a towel wrapped around my head and a towel wrapped around my chest so all my lady bits were covered but as I was talking to him asking him why he wasn't ready or at least getting ready since we were already late. The fact that he would not look me in the eye was so obvious it was actually awkward so finally I yelled MICHAEL look at me when I am talking to you. He turned to me and his face was super red and he quickly glanced down which caused me to look down to see what he was looking at I noticed that my towel when I sat down rode upwards and what I thought was covered was actually exposed and he seen all of my undercarriage. Quickly I jumped up and ran into my room and got dressed and about 16 min later I walked out determined to pretend my little brother did not just see my pussy, but he was not where I left him. I turn around and see the bathroom was open but his bedroom was not. I walked down the hall and knocked on his door and tried to turn the knob when he answered \"Yeah\" but it was locked \"Go on to the party I aint going I dont feel good.\" When I tried to ask another question his tone changed and he basically yelled for me to go away,\n\n   I was not at the party long I just couldn't get into party mode the drinks were not going down easy and I kept thinking about Michael and him yelling at me plus something was up because he had been excited about this party all month then all the sudden he doesn't to go. It was a few hours I had been gone so I took off my heels and walked the few blocks with a few other people that lived in our apartment building and I headed home. When I got into my room I noticed that my hamper had been gone through at first I thought maybe he did some laundry but it didn't seem like there was any less than there was when I left. I flopped back into bed and when I rolled over I found under my pillow was the pair of panties I had on before I took a shower and they were wet, not cum but like spit. I reach over to grab my bottle of water and notice that my nightstand drawer was slightly open and when I opened it up my one and only toy was not in its usual spot. I gave it the once over and it was not used that I could tell but still I thought it was weird. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The next morning I was up early and before my brother when he woke up he was normal and came and sat down next to me on the couch. He normally sits on the other side of the couch but this morning he sat down so close his legs were touching the bottom of my feet ( I was sitting with my knees bent and my feet under my butt) its my classic morning coffee sitting position. I wanted to ask him if he had been in my room but I didn't I decided to study his behavior and see if he was at all different. I have found my dirty underwear in different places from where I left them almost daily when I come back from class or anywhere when he is home and I am gone for a long time through out the day. Another thing I notice after I use my toy it is moved and smells like breath, (like when you lick your hand and after a few seconds sniff it) and I can not help but think that he is trying to taste me off of it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   Now I know normal people would be disgusted or at least pretend that way so other people wouldn't judge them but I am highly turned on by all of this. I make sure to leave the panties I know I got super wet in on top for him to get and when I noticed my toy has been moved I use it almost immediately. The thing that I am having issues with is I am starting to see him different no matter how hard I try not too I do so even more. He is actually sitting down from me on the couch now and I have my knees bent supporting my laptop and my toes are tucked up under his leg as he plays xbox thinking I am writing a paper for class. A part of me wants to keep this a secret and never let him now I know what he is up too but a bigger more scared version of me wants to tell him I know and he doesn't have to sneak around and see where that leads us. I suppose that is where you all come in to play at if at all anyone reads this.

He is 20, I am 13. I am male as well. The problems started far too long ago to say, but it has escalated as of late. He is selfish. He has almost no friends. He doesn't care about others and babies our dog that needs training. We share a Nintendo Switch. He is in community college. He doesn't have a job. He is constantly rude. He almost always has his headphones on and can't go 10 minutes without his goddamn phone. He has no inspiration. He doesn't have a driver's license. He has submitted ONE job application and didn't get it, which doesn't surprise me. He swears A LOT. He is worse with chores than I am.\n\nAfter all that background information, I feel the need to point out one specific thing. He had bought a game and wanted to play it first because it was his, which makes complete sense. He is seldom not home before me and complains about not having any free time to play. This is horseshit. He has more time than me, his younger brother. I had confronted him many times about the issue because I wanted to play it to and he was being selfish and controlling. One day, a few weeks before Thanksgiving, I asked it I could have a date to play because I was done with his shit. We agreed on Thanksgiving of that year. He didn't hand it over until I called out mom down (we don't live with our dad) and she talked about it. In one week I had played 18 hours, which I felt was a really long time.\n\nHere's where it gets good though. He has played for at most 3 days and has around the same amount of time, let's say 15 hours. I used ~1\/9 of my total time in that week playing. He has used ~1\/5 of his time in those three days. I talked to him about it and he blew up in my face and started cussing me out. \n\nI would generally say I am rude to him, not nearly as much however. My mother does not want to buy him a PS4 for Christmas because he wastes his time enough as it is. I agree with her concern.\n\nNow people of this subreddit, AITA and do you have any advice for me on my situation?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AmItheAsshole","subreddit_subscribers":382296,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA for being rude to my addicted brother?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/a1za17\/aita_for_being_rude_to_my_addicted_brother\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}
