I was in the USMC from right after graduating Highschool. It wasn&amp;#39;t a thing I took lightly as I honestly needed help to pay for the schools I was accepted into. I ended up struggling through Boot as everyone does, but learning to love it. I never had depression issues prior or honestly most of the time I was in. I don&amp;#39;t want to go into too much detail but I was deployed and injured 2005/2006 timeframe. My injury was not to the point of early retirement but, with something changed in me. I developed the strongest hate for myself, and just the thought of breathing made me fill with rage. with the highs of anger came the deepest valleys of lows. After being released from the naval hospital and going back to my &amp;quot;light duty routine&amp;quot; on base, well I couldnt take it anymore, and made an attempt on my life. I wasnt scared, it seemed like the release of pressure. That&amp;#39;s the only way I could describe it. To put it short, they sent me to a naval head doc, and gave me a general under honorable conditions discharge for failure to cope. I went home to my parents home a truly even more broken man. I couldnt even end my own pain. My family treated me like a special person. The spikes of rage and long periods of absolute dark misery continued and grew. I was unable to hold down a job for very long, and struggled with money, at times being homeless living in my car. (I couldnt stand being around my family no matter how much they wanted to help, they just couldnt understand). During this time 06-08ish, I moved a bunch, was in a few truly horrible relationships with women I should have known would be nothing but misery, and they fed into my self loathing. I hid my feelings, hid them as much as could, and would go home (when I had one), and cry, cry like a sobbing child unable to breath. This all continued, and in 2008 I started a relationship with another &amp;quot;troubled soul&amp;quot;, she had every warning sign to stay away there could be. (recently divorced at 22, history of infidelity, no personal drive, etc.) well convinced of how horrible I was, and I couldn&amp;#39;t do any better, I stayed with her..even was convinced to marry her (because as i was told by family, &amp;quot;thats the right thing to do&amp;quot;). I refused to have a formal wedding as I was embarrassed. We married, and continued to struggle. As part of my off and on treatment through the VA (Department of Veteran&amp;#39;s Affiars), I was put on a number of medications to stabilize my moods, and to help me sleep. One night a few months after the &amp;quot;sham marriage&amp;quot; begun, I had taken my nightly cocktail of zombifying drugs and proceeded to go lay down in bed by myself. My then &amp;quot;Wife&amp;quot; having numerous issues of her own, and desperatly wanting children (which I did not), forced herself on my half unconscious, yet completely not lucid self. I had never been so angry, and from that point on slept alone in another bedroom with the door locked. She confirmed later that she was in fact with child.

I was in the USMC from right after graduating Highschool. It wasn't a thing I took lightly as I honestly needed help to pay for the schools I was accepted into. I ended up struggling through Boot as everyone does, but learning to love it. I never had depression issues prior or honestly most of the time I was in. I don't want to go into too much detail but I was deployed and injured 2005/2006 timeframe. My injury was not to the point of early retirement but, with something changed in me. I developed the strongest hate for myself, and just the thought of breathing made me fill with rage. with the highs of anger came the deepest valleys of lows. After being released from the naval hospital and going back to my \"light duty routine\" on base, well I couldnt take it anymore, and made an attempt on my life. I wasnt scared, it seemed like the release of pressure. That's the only way I could describe it. To put it short, they sent me to a naval head doc, and gave me a general under honorable conditions discharge for failure to cope. I went home to my parents home a truly even more broken man. I couldnt even end my own pain. My family treated me like a special person. The spikes of rage and long periods of absolute dark misery continued and grew. I was unable to hold down a job for very long, and struggled with money, at times being homeless living in my car. (I couldnt stand being around my family no matter how much they wanted to help, they just couldnt understand). During this time 06-08ish, I moved a bunch, was in a few truly horrible relationships with women I should have known would be nothing but misery, and they fed into my self loathing. I hid my feelings, hid them as much as could, and would go home (when I had one), and cry, cry like a sobbing child unable to breath. This all continued, and in 2008 I started a relationship with another \"troubled soul\", she had every warning sign to stay away there could be. (recently divorced at 22, history of infidelity, no personal drive, etc.) well convinced of how horrible I was, and I couldn't do any better, I stayed with her..even was convinced to marry her (because as i was told by family, \"thats the right thing to do\"). I refused to have a formal wedding as I was embarrassed. We married, and continued to struggle. As part of my off and on treatment through the VA (Department of Veteran's Affiars), I was put on a number of medications to stabilize my moods, and to help me sleep. One night a few months after the \"sham marriage\" begun, I had taken my nightly cocktail of zombifying drugs and proceeded to go lay down in bed by myself. My then \"Wife\" having numerous issues of her own, and desperatly wanting children (which I did not), forced herself on my half unconscious, yet completely not lucid self. I had never been so angry, and from that point on slept alone in another bedroom with the door locked. She confirmed later that she was in fact with child.

Which shockingly didn't work very well or at all, but the tics eventually became manageable enough that I could go back to school. I went on (real) medication for TS.

{"mod_reports":[],"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, \nJust wanted another opinion here and see if any of you could help, since I don&amp;#39;t really have anyone to ask in real life about this. Just for reference, I&amp;#39;m 22 and about 140lbs at 5&amp;#39;7&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve never been overweight or anything. So I&amp;#39;ve been doing the stronglifts program for almost three months now, and eating pretty healthy. I lift weights three times a week, and do cardio 4-5 days a week, either 20 or 30 minutes of it, depending on whether it&amp;#39;s a lifting day or not. I eat mostly paleo, except I don&amp;#39;t really follow the no-legumes rule; I still eat things like black beans sometimes, and I do consume a bit of dairy, although not too much. I also don&amp;#39;t count calories and would like to avoid doing so if possible, as I feel like it will drive me absolutely insane. I do cheat sometimes on the weekends, but I don&amp;#39;t do whole &amp;quot;cheat days.&amp;quot; Also I generally eat two meals a day (because I don&amp;#39;t get hungry all that often), plus a snack before my workout. I don&amp;#39;t FEEL like I&amp;#39;m eating too many calories at each meal...for lunch it&amp;#39;s usually a salad with no dressing and some kind of meat, and for dinner it&amp;#39;s usually just meat and veggies. If I eat breakfast I always have two eggs, sometimes fruit with that. I always stop when I start getting full. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I do think I look more fit, and have definitely improved quite a bit in the amount I can lift than I did before I started the program, I realized the other day that I do not look any different than I did about two months ago. I feel like I&amp;#39;ve been putting in all of this work with almost no aesthetic results.

Just for reference, I'm 22 and about 140lbs at 5'7\". I've never been overweight or anything. So I've been doing the stronglifts program for almost three months now, and eating pretty healthy. I lift weights three times a week, and do cardio 4-5 days a week, either 20 or 30 minutes of it, depending on whether it's a lifting day or not. I eat mostly paleo, except I don't really follow the no-legumes rule; I still eat things like black beans sometimes, and I do consume a bit of dairy, although not too much. I also don't count calories and would like to avoid doing so if possible, as I feel like it will drive me absolutely insane. I do cheat sometimes on the weekends, but I don't do whole \"cheat days.\" Also I generally eat two meals a day (because I don't get hungry all that often), plus a snack before my workout. I don't FEEL like I'm eating too many calories at each meal...for lunch it's usually a salad with no dressing and some kind of meat, and for dinner it's usually just meat and veggies. If I eat breakfast I always have two eggs, sometimes fruit with that. I always stop when I start getting full. \n\nWhile I do think I look more fit, and have definitely improved quite a bit in the amount I can lift than I did before I started the program, I realized the other day that I do not look any different than I did about two months ago. I feel like I've been putting in all of this work with almost no aesthetic results.

Here is the whole story. I live in a small apartment with my parents (my older brother has moved out). My dad is sort of indifferent, but my mum is absolutely against it.\n\nI will skip straight to the main reason of my bringing of this matter up at this particular time. I have estranged myself from my own emotions during my life by actively trying to reject emotions in general since I was little due to traumatic events that happened in kindergarten. Think Star Trek's Vulcans. I have been working on it and have felt whole a few months ago for the first time in years, but now another problem has arised, relationships with other people. I can say I communicate well with others, and can talk about my deepest thoughts fairly easily, but I still cannot feel emotionally connected with anyone. I can almost say I feel lonely except, and here's the kicker, when playing with dogs. I believe it's due to their rather simple nature: their emotions are pure, there are no hidden intentions or anything alike. I can sit with my grandparents' dog, Ari (black Labrador Retriever, he's 4 years old now), just watching the sunset and feel a really special bond, and some sort of warmth I haven't felt in literally years. I don't see Ari much, but when I do, there's a well-established relationship I've been working on since he was a puppy. As if there is mutual respect between us, as if he understands my thought process. He will play when it's playtime, calm down when he needs to, we've come to a point where I barely need to scold him anymore, which is just magnificent. I firmly believe that raising a dog will be the most difficult, fun and enriching task I will have ever done, and I haven't considered myself ready for such a responsibility until I reached this point where I can firmly say I am comfortable with who I am and I wouldn't be okay taking this on if it were any other way.\n\nMoving on to more practical concerns. Summer is coming up and with the free time, I think I'll be able to get to know my pup well. My mum's main arguments for not allowing a dog are living in a small apartment (a fair point, it's not cluttered or anything, but it is still fairly small, about 600 sq feet), shedding and potty training (especially with basically every inch of the apartment's floor being covered in carpets). The first one is my main concern as well, I don't want the poor thing feeling trapped as a small apartment with no yard is definitely not an ideal environment for any breed. I would remedy this by taking it on runs every day in the morning, and in the evening if needed as well. As for the other two, there are breeds that don't shed heavily and I would be responsible for cleaning up after the puppy and potty training it. I think her primary concern is space and having to take care of the dog herself with work and all. I would absolutely be taking care of everything dog-related, but space is my concern too. The *last* thing I want is for the thing to feel tortured, I fear my best care may not be enough due to space constraints.\n\nIn short, I believe I am fit to own a dog, but I live in a less than ideal environment, a small apartment with no yard.\n\nIs getting a dog a good idea? If so, what breed would you recommend (I'd just like it to be fairly calm when it grows up, and intelligent) given the situation?

It sucks doesn’t it? You’re emotions are on one of the worst rollercoasters you’ve ever been on? You feel like you are the only one to truly be hurting? No one has ever felt this pain that you are feeling? You’ve been in bed crying for three days and don’t want to even talk about it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m here to tell you that it gets better..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see my fiancé of 7 years and I broke up last week. We tried EVERYTHING we could to save it, counseling, date nights, acting “as if we were in love”, nothing seemed to fix a relationship that quite frankly just…”ran its course”. It happens, sure you’ve had a great run, but have you really? I will go more in-depth what I mean by this here in a moment. I want you to know that ALL the emotions that you are feeling are not abnormal, everything is completely normal and we all feel them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m going to go step by step as much as I can to help you begin your healing process....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Failing Relationship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you find yourselves falling farther and farther away from each other? You guys aren’t communicating anymore are you? There’s no intimacy, and you cant remember the last time you’ve hugged, held the persons hand, or let alone gotten a kiss right? These are all signs that something is up in your relationship, I’m not saying that someone is cheating I’m just saying that something is off. When I stopped hearing an “I love you” occasionally is when I started to get nervous about where our relationship stopped. Sure we didn’t say it a lot to each other but we still said it, and when we did it meant something more since it wasn’t over used in our relationship. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the warning signs are there you can do a few different things. Every couple is different and will go through a different process than the next, but the most important thing to do is try and fix what you can before it’s too late to fix. So explore your options that you have around you before you decide to end this relationship. Seven years (like my relationship) had a lot more in it than a relationship of seven days, weeks, or months would have so play your cards accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you work this out on your own? Has this worked for you in the past? Have you guys sat down, talked about it, the other changes for a few weeks and before you know it…BOOM! You’re arguing about the same stuff again. This is something that happens in EVERY relationship, not just yours. Some talk it out and are great forever, others are only good for a week or two. If you decide to go this route really think about if you are getting what you want out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ever considered going to a counselor? Someone who can look at your relationship as a whole from the outside and see if this is something can be fixed. This is the route I took and it helped me with realizing that she just wasn’t into the relationship the same way I was, and made the breakup a lot easier for the two of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about the breakup? Sure it’s a tough decision to make, but if you guys aren’t happy then end it before you end up hating each other for the rest of your lives. Like they always used to say to us “If you love something set it free, if it comes back it was meant to be; if it doesn’t; it wasn’t”. Don’t wait to go down this road until after you guys truly start to hate each other, go down it sooner than later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Breakup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This section is the hardest one to cover. People go through all different types of breakups. Regardless of your type of breakup eventually you will feel all kinds of emotions, some good, some bad, and for the most part you will be VERY sad. But something you need to realize is that you will get over whatever emotion you are feeling. Today marks day 8 since I said my very last “goodbye” to (in my opinion) the greatest girl in the world. Last week I would have told you I will NEVER get over this intense feeling of sadness that I am feeling, but here I am 8 days later telling you it does get better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main things you need to keep focus on in this portion is that you make it a clean breakup and NO CONTACT ! If you do that it will make the healing process go a lot more smoothly. One of the things that suck so bad is that when I was sad, mad, or felt any other kind of emotion I would talk to her about it, and now I can’t because she’s the one who I am hurting over. But please don’t lose your cool no matter what….DO NOT LOSE YOUR COOL!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post Breakup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You did it! You broke up with the “love of your life”.... How are you feeling? Sad, depressed, angry, stress? Those are all very normal feelings after a breakup, that’s what makes them suck SO BADLY! I had a 4 day “pitty party” for myself, I didn’t eat, I only drank water, and laid in bed all freaking day. That’s all I wanted to do, I mean how could anyone function after losing the greatest thing in their life? How can someone go outside without their other half? How can I face big decisions without talking to THEM first? Guess what? You &lt;strong&gt;CAN&lt;/strong&gt; do it! &lt;strong&gt;You can do it, and you will do it!&lt;/strong&gt; But please take time for yourself first. Don’t breakup and then two days later go “ok I’m good, lets go out and find a new partner”. You are repressing normal human emotions by doing something like that and eventually you will regret it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to take time to grieve and then go about your normal every day life. You’ll have to grocery shop; FOR ONE....You’ll have to pay the bills; ALONE....You’ll cook dinner; FOR ONLY YOURSELF....You’ll go to bed every night; ALONE....It’s a rough transition to go from thinking about another person to only thinking about yourself. My other half LOVED coffee, the smell of it throughout the house would signify the start of her morning.  Imagine what it was like going down the juice aisle at the store and smelling the coffee from behind you. The same smell that would let you know she was up, ready, and waiting for her “morning kiss”, or her “have a great day”, imagine what that was like smelling the smell of coffee for the first time post-breakup. There will be the little triggers that will make you think of that person, and that’s ok.That’s a memory that will always be with you no matter what and that’s something no one will take or can take away from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please have a support system in place as well. Whether it’d be family, friends, a neighbor, someone from church, anyone you can just unload your feelings onto and they will just listen, that&amp;#39;s what makes a great support system. My greatest crutch has been an old friend I haven’t seen since High School but we’ve maintained a “Facebook Friendship”, she’s been the best one out of my family and closest friends so far. Because she doesn’t bring it up, we’ll talk about other things and then I’ll just casually talk about it and she’ll make some comments or remarks and we’ll move on from the discussion. Just make sure you have someone to talk too, feel free to contact me if you’d like, I’d be more than happy to just listen to you and hear you through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think back on your entire relationship……….. What did you sacrifice for that person because he or she didn’t like it? Really dig deep and think about it, hard. Because you will realize that you made a lot of sacrifices to make someone else happy, while ignoring what made YOU happy. Sure at the time you don’t mind making those sacrifices because that person truly matters to you more that you matter to yourself, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to be able to LOVE YOU before you can love another. This one hit me in the middle of the night, out of the blue. I was sitting in bed thinking about my former girlfriend (I don’t refer to her as my “ex”) and I remember going “Wow, you haven’t been happy for a really long time”. It’s true, I’ve been so miserable for the past year and a half deep inside of me that I was no longer the old me, I had become someone I wasn’t. Then it got me to thinking, it was because I was forming to what “SHE” wanted me to be, I was doing things that made HER happy and not doing things that made ME happy. In order to truly be happy with your life you need to be happy with yourself, and to achieve that you also have to be in love with yourself as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Breakups suck! Plain and simple, you will think that you are alone in feeling what you are feeling but you aren’t we were their once too, I’m still there. But you have to make sure that you allow yourself to heal properly before moving on and being happy again. I’ve started doing that and the other day I had to go over to the former girlfriends house for something and when I was talking to her I felt as if I was talking to a really good friend. This was only 5 days post-breakup and I was already starting to move on and heal. Why? Because of a great support system that I had in place to help me move on quickly from the breakup. Now, don’t get me wrong I’m still sad! But this process has hills, and it has valleys…Right now I’m in a valley at the base of a hill, I need to tell myself “It’s time to climb that hill” and when I do, I will have people to lean on to help me get over the hill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember to love yourself…THAT’S the MOST IMPORTANT part of the healing process!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to read about how I am doing with my breakup check out my blog: &lt;a href=\"http://www.breakupsarehard.com\"&gt;www.breakupsarehard.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Authors Note: I typed this on my iPhone in the middle of an airport, so don’t judge me based on grammar or spelling mistakes I will fix them when I get to a computer tomorrow.

It sucks doesn’t it? You’re emotions are on one of the worst rollercoasters you’ve ever been on? You feel like you are the only one to truly be hurting? No one has ever felt this pain that you are feeling? You’ve been in bed crying for three days and don’t want to even talk about it?\n\nI’m here to tell you that it gets better..\n\nYou see my fiancé of 7 years and I broke up last week. We tried EVERYTHING we could to save it, counseling, date nights, acting “as if we were in love”, nothing seemed to fix a relationship that quite frankly just…”ran its course”. It happens, sure you’ve had a great run, but have you really? I will go more in-depth what I mean by this here in a moment. I want you to know that ALL the emotions that you are feeling are not abnormal, everything is completely normal and we all feel them.\n\nI’m going to go step by step as much as I can to help you begin your healing process....\n\n\n**The Failing Relationship**\n\nDo you find yourselves falling farther and farther away from each other? You guys aren’t communicating anymore are you? There’s no intimacy, and you cant remember the last time you’ve hugged, held the persons hand, or let alone gotten a kiss right? These are all signs that something is up in your relationship, I’m not saying that someone is cheating I’m just saying that something is off. When I stopped hearing an “I love you” occasionally is when I started to get nervous about where our relationship stopped. Sure we didn’t say it a lot to each other but we still said it, and when we did it meant something more since it wasn’t over used in our relationship. \n\nWhen the warning signs are there you can do a few different things. Every couple is different and will go through a different process than the next, but the most important thing to do is try and fix what you can before it’s too late to fix. So explore your options that you have around you before you decide to end this relationship. Seven years (like my relationship) had a lot more in it than a relationship of seven days, weeks, or months would have so play your cards accordingly. \n\nCan you work this out on your own? Has this worked for you in the past? Have you guys sat down, talked about it, the other changes for a few weeks and before you know it…BOOM! You’re arguing about the same stuff again. This is something that happens in EVERY relationship, not just yours. Some talk it out and are great forever, others are only good for a week or two. If you decide to go this route really think about if you are getting what you want out of it.\n\nHave you ever considered going to a counselor? Someone who can look at your relationship as a whole from the outside and see if this is something can be fixed. This is the route I took and it helped me with realizing that she just wasn’t into the relationship the same way I was, and made the breakup a lot easier for the two of us.\n\nWhat about the breakup? Sure it’s a tough decision to make, but if you guys aren’t happy then end it before you end up hating each other for the rest of your lives. Like they always used to say to us “If you love something set it free, if it comes back it was meant to be; if it doesn’t; it wasn’t”. Don’t wait to go down this road until after you guys truly start to hate each other, go down it sooner than later. \n\n**The Breakup**\n\nThis section is the hardest one to cover. People go through all different types of breakups. Regardless of your type of breakup eventually you will feel all kinds of emotions, some good, some bad, and for the most part you will be VERY sad. But something you need to realize is that you will get over whatever emotion you are feeling. Today marks day 8 since I said my very last “goodbye” to (in my opinion) the greatest girl in the world. Last week I would have told you I will NEVER get over this intense feeling of sadness that I am feeling, but here I am 8 days later telling you it does get better. \n\nThe main things you need to keep focus on in this portion is that you make it a clean breakup and NO CONTACT ! If you do that it will make the healing process go a lot more smoothly. One of the things that suck so bad is that when I was sad, mad, or felt any other kind of emotion I would talk to her about it, and now I can’t because she’s the one who I am hurting over. But please don’t lose your cool no matter what….DO NOT LOSE YOUR COOL!\n\n**Post Breakup**\n\nYou did it! You broke up with the “love of your life”.... How are you feeling? Sad, depressed, angry, stress? Those are all very normal feelings after a breakup, that’s what makes them suck SO BADLY! I had a 4 day “pitty party” for myself, I didn’t eat, I only drank water, and laid in bed all freaking day. That’s all I wanted to do, I mean how could anyone function after losing the greatest thing in their life? How can someone go outside without their other half? How can I face big decisions without talking to THEM first? Guess what? You **CAN** do it! **You can do it, and you will do it!** But please take time for yourself first. Don’t breakup and then two days later go “ok I’m good, lets go out and find a new partner”. You are repressing normal human emotions by doing something like that and eventually you will regret it.\n\nYou have to take time to grieve and then go about your normal every day life. You’ll have to grocery shop; FOR ONE....You’ll have to pay the bills; ALONE....You’ll cook dinner; FOR ONLY YOURSELF....You’ll go to bed every night; ALONE....It’s a rough transition to go from thinking about another person to only thinking about yourself. My other half LOVED coffee, the smell of it throughout the house would signify the start of her morning.  Imagine what it was like going down the juice aisle at the store and smelling the coffee from behind you. The same smell that would let you know she was up, ready, and waiting for her “morning kiss”, or her “have a great day”, imagine what that was like smelling the smell of coffee for the first time post-breakup. There will be the little triggers that will make you think of that person, and that’s ok.That’s a memory that will always be with you no matter what and that’s something no one will take or can take away from you.\n\nPlease have a support system in place as well. Whether it’d be family, friends, a neighbor, someone from church, anyone you can just unload your feelings onto and they will just listen, that's what makes a great support system. My greatest crutch has been an old friend I haven’t seen since High School but we’ve maintained a “Facebook Friendship”, she’s been the best one out of my family and closest friends so far. Because she doesn’t bring it up, we’ll talk about other things and then I’ll just casually talk about it and she’ll make some comments or remarks and we’ll move on from the discussion. Just make sure you have someone to talk too, feel free to contact me if you’d like, I’d be more than happy to just listen to you and hear you through.\n\n**Moving On**\n\nThink back on your entire relationship……….. What did you sacrifice for that person because he or she didn’t like it? Really dig deep and think about it, hard. Because you will realize that you made a lot of sacrifices to make someone else happy, while ignoring what made YOU happy.

Seven years (like my relationship) had a lot more in it than a relationship of seven days, weeks, or months would have so play your cards accordingly. \n    Can you work this out on your own? Has this worked for you in the past? Have you guys sat down, talked about it, the other changes for a few weeks and before you know it…BOOM! You’re arguing about the same stuff again. This is something that happens in EVERY relationship, not just yours. Some talk it out and are great forever, others are only good for a week or two. If you decide to go this route really think about if you are getting what you want out of it.\n    Have you ever considered going to a counselor? Someone who can look at your relationship as a whole from the outside and see if this is something can be fixed. This is the route I took and it helped me with realizing that she just wasn’t into the relationship the same way I was, and made the breakup a lot easier for the two of us.\n    What about the breakup? Sure it’s a tough decision to make, but if you guys aren’t happy then end it before you end up hating each other for the rest of your lives! Like they always used to say to us “If you love something set it free, if it comes back it was meant to be; if it doesn’t; it wasn’t!” Don’t wait to go down this road until after you guys truly start to hate each other, go down it sooner than later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Breakup:\n    This section is the hardest one to cover. People go through all different types of breakups! Regardless of your type of breakup eventually you will feel all kinds of emotions, some good, some bad, and for the most part you will be VERY sad. But something you need to realize is that you will get over whatever emotion you are feeling. Today marks day 8 since I said my very last “goodbye” to (in my opinion) the greatest girl in the world. Last week I would have told you I will NEVER get over this intense feeling of sadness that I am feeling, but here I am 8 days later telling you it does get better. \n    The main things you need to keep focus on in this portion is that you make it a clean breakup and NO CONTACT ! If you do that it will make the healing process go a lot more smoothly! One of the things that suck so bad is that when I was sad, mad, or felt any other kind of emotion I would talk to her about it, and now I can’t because she’s the one who I am hurting over. But please don’t lose your cool no matter what….DO NOT LOSE YOUR COOL!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Post Breakup:\n    You did it! You broke up with the “love of your life”! How are you feeling? Sad, depressed, angry, stress? Those are all very normal feelings after a breakup, that’s what makes them suck SO BADLY! I have a 4 day “pitty party” for myself! I didn’t eat I only drank water, and laid in bed! That’s all I wanted to do, I mean how could anyone function after losing the greatest thing in their life? How can someone go outside without their other half? How can I face big decisions without talking to THEM first? Guess what? You can do it! You can do it, and you will do it! But please take time for yourself first! Don’t breakup and then two days later go “ok I’m good, lets go out and find a new partner”. You are repressing normal human emotions by doing something like that and eventually you will regret it.\n    You have to take time to grieve and then go about your normal every day life. You’ll have to grocery shop; FOR ONE! You’ll have to pay the bills; ALONE! You’ll cook dinner; FOR YOURSELF! You’ll go to bed every night; ALONE! It’s a rough transition to go from thinking about another person to only thinking about yourself. My other half LOVED coffee, the smell of it throughout the house would signify the start of her morning.  Imagine what it was like going down the juice aisle at the store and smelling the coffee from behind you. The same smell that would let you know she was up, ready, and waiting for her “morning kiss”, or her “have a great day”, imagine what that was like smelling the smell of coffee for the first time post-breakup! There will be the little triggers that will make you think of that person, and that’s ok! That’s a memory that will always be with you no matter what and that’s something no one will take or can take away from you.\n    Please have a support system in place as well! Whether it’d be family, friends, a neighbor, someone from church, anyone you can just unload your feelings on and they will listen makes a great support system. My greatest crutch has been an old friend I haven’t seen since High School but we’ve maintained a “Facebook Friendship”, she’s been the best one out of my family and closest friends so far. Because she doesn’t bring it up, we’ll talk about other things and then I’ll just casually talk about it and she’ll make some comments or remarks and we’ll move on from the discussion. Just make sure you have someone to talk too, feel free to contact me if you’d like, I’d be more than happy to just listen to you and hear you through!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moving On:\n    Think back on your entire relationship……….. What did you sacrifice for that person because he or she didn’t like it? Really dig deep and think about it, hard! Because you will realize that you made a lot of sacrifices to make someone else happy, while ignoring what made YOU happy. Sure at the time you don’t mind making those sacrifices because that person truly matters to you more that you matter to yourself, right?\n    You need to be able to LOVE YOU before you can love another. This one hit me in the middle of the night, out of the blue. I was sitting in bed thinking about my former girlfriend (I don’t refer to her as my “ex”) and I remember going “Wow, you haven’t been happy for a really long time”. It’s true, I’ve been so miserable for the past year and a half deep inside of me that I was no longer the old me, I had become someone I wasn’t. Then it got me to thinking, it was because I was forming to what “SHE” wanted me to be, I was doing things that made HER happy and not doing things that made ME happy. In order to truly be happy with your life you need to be happy with yourself, and to achieve that you also have to be in love with yourself as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Breakups suck! Plain and simple, you will think that you are alone in feeling what you are feeling but you aren’t we were their once too, I’m still there. But you have to make sure that you allow yourself to heal properly before moving on and being happy again. I’ve started doing that and the other day I had to go over to the former girlfriends house for something and when I was talking to her I felt as if I was talking to a really good friend. This was only 5 days post-breakup and I was already starting to move on and heal. Why? Because of a great support system that I had in place to help me move on quickly from the breakup. Now, don’t get me wrong I’m still sad! But this process has hills, and it has valleys…Right now I’m in a valley at the base of a hill, I need to tell myself “It’s time to climb that hill” and when I do, I will have people to lean on to help me get over the hill.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember to love yourself…THAT’S the MOST IMPORTANT part of the healing process!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to read about how I am doing with my breakup check out my blog: &lt;a href=\"http://www.breakupsarehard.com\"&gt;www.breakupsarehard.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Authors Note: I typed this on my iPhone in the middle of an airport, so don’t judge me based on grammar or spelling mistakes I will fix them when I get to a computer tomorrow.

She looks nice and she&amp;#39;s a genuinely nice person. You start feeling attracted towards her sexually and one day you admit this to her and she says &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m flattered but you&amp;#39;re just too short.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This makes you feel awful. It&amp;#39;s so unfair that the only thing holding you back from what you want is a trait totally out of your control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well guess what mate : Fuck you! :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s not fair!&amp;quot; attitude has just told everyone that if you were the &amp;quot;ideal height&amp;quot; you&amp;#39;d date this person. Your problem isn&amp;#39;t that your short, your problem is that you have no integrity. How do I know you have no integrity? Because the correct response to someone saying &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t date &lt;em&gt;physical trait here&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;Fantastic, I don&amp;#39;t date fuckwits!&amp;quot;. You don&amp;#39;t get upset, you don&amp;#39;t howl at the moon, you don&amp;#39;t write terrible poetry, You smile, wish them the best and get the fuck out of there feeling grateful that you dodged a bullet. A big stupid bullet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re short, you have an automatic filter for people who are emotionally immature, lack a certain amount of basic introspection and who more than likely have little to no intellectual aspirations. &lt;strong&gt;This is only a problem for you if you&amp;#39;re emotionally immature, lack a certain amount of basic introspection and have little to no intellectual aspirations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I know women who have an issue dating shorter guys and they&amp;#39;re really nice, social and well enough adjusted people! Most of them are also incredibly insecure and derive huge amounts of their self worth from their physical appearance. They validate themselves through sex and define attractiveness by the most basic and limited criteria possible. Why? Because it&amp;#39;s worked so well for them their entire lives. It&amp;#39;s kind of hard to blame someone for shitty behaviour when they&amp;#39;ve encountered almost no stress from which to grow. I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;re having a great time cruising along like this but guess what? It&amp;#39;s a terrible system that is doomed to failure. Sooner or later there are going to be some major psychological implications once they start to fall apart physically and they&amp;#39;re going to be thoroughly unequipped to deal with any of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, for the rest of us, the world is a horrible place and we all get to suffer and compensate for it! Then we get broader perspectives, become more well rounded and gain a deeper criteria for attractiveness. There are a rare breed of people out there who are both physically stunning and mentally amazing but the astonishing thing about them is the mental side; that they&amp;#39;ve been able to cultivate this intellect without the typical stress. But if you don&amp;#39;t read (at all), don&amp;#39;t have some basic appreciation of art, history, philosphy, culture and have no intellectual curiosity, then yeah, you are completely fucked, you&amp;#39;re playing the wrong game. If you&amp;#39;re physical attributes, which have no intrinsic value and are almost entirely defined by the culture in which you live, aren&amp;#39;t considered attractive, then you don&amp;#39;t get to be a shallow dickhead and have a good time, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day it&amp;#39;s also worth remembering there isn&amp;#39;t a single group of people with distinct physical traits that don&amp;#39;t get discriminated against. I know a lot of women who look at the mainstream attractive ideal male and say there&amp;#39;s no way they&amp;#39;d date a guy like that! Yep, even attractive people can be deemed unattractive (who knew being perceived as high maintenance and shallow could be sexual kryptonite to certain people!). I also have a few male friends who are well above 6&amp;#39; who absolutely struggle to get dates. Being tall isn&amp;#39;t the magic answer either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you&amp;#39;re going to bitch about being marginalised by men : Go do some functional, preferably maximal strength training and learn a horrifying martial art for 5+ years. You&amp;#39;ll never have to use it (unless you&amp;#39;re a fuckwit) but it will change your posture and make you feel comfortable and amused knowing just how hilariously weak and untrained the general male population is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally, to anyone saying how would I know what it&amp;#39;s actually like, well, I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;3&amp;quot; and in my early 30&amp;#39;s - I&amp;#39;m a crafty veteran.

My dad cooks very well and we eat all kinds of food during the week (I'm talking about dinner cause it's the only meal we share together).\n\nI'm wondering if I can have good gains with this diet which doesn't seem very hard to follow. I will only write the kcal values:\n\n----------------------\n\n**BreakFast**\n\n2 X A bowl of cereals with milk (~800 Kcal)\n\n1 X A glass of milk (~100 Kcal)\n\n**Snack**\n\n3 X chocolate biscuits with a tablespoon of peanut butter on it (~600 Kcal)\n1 X A glass of milk (~100 Kcal)\n\n**Lunch**\n\n1 X A piece of baguette with ham, cheese and olive oil (~600 Kcal)\n\n1 X Milkshake bananas/vanilla ice cream/ milk/ olive oil (~600 Kcal)\n\n**Snack**\n\n3 X chocolate biscuits with a table spoon of peanutbutter on it (~600 Kcal)\n1 X A glass of milk (~100 Kcal)\n\n**Dinner**\nAs I said, I don't plan on changing my dinner diet so it's sometimes chicken, sometimes beef, pork, fish... Always with french fries or potatoes or pasta. And some vegetables too.\n\n----------------------\n\nAs you can see, without counting the dinner's Kcal and a last snack the evening (not sure if I should eat it or not), \n**the amount of Kcal =~3500** (so easily 4000Kcal with the dinner)\n\nWhat did I miss in this diet? It seems too easy to follow and I don't get why. Can you guys help me a little bit?

As of today, I am 13 lbs down from where I started 12 weeks ago and I feel amazing. \n\n[PROGRESS PICS! NSFW](http://imgur.com/a/ocABr)\n\nWhat I've been doing:\n\nNutrition: Counted calories religiously for the first 2 months; now have a pretty decent feel for how much I can eat in a day and come in at 1500 calories (what MFP put me at to lose 1lb per week). I eat fast food very, very rarely now (once a week MAYBE but I would prefer to go to a nicer sit-down anyway if I'm going to splurge). I pack my lunch almost every day. My food scale has become my friend. A couple of things about me and my habits: \n\n* I buy a huge bag of fresh spinach every couple of weeks, puree it down and freeze it in ice cube trays.\n\n* I am dairy/casein/whey and egg intolerant so while I technically CAN eat those things, they don't make me feel good...eggs are the worst for me, I can handle one or two pieces of cheese during the day. So everything listed below is going to be mostly dairy/egg free, with a couple of exceptions for convenience. \n\n* I am a caseworker and spend a decent part of my day on the road with no microwave or refrigerator. I see clients for 2 hours at a time, then drive to see the next one, while making and returning calls and trying to eat...usually seeing 3-4 clients per day. This means my food has to be packable and ready to eat. Fast food used to be my downfall because I didn't plan well!\n\nA typical day's food:\n\n**Breakfast** - one of three protein smoothies, they all run about 350 calories, plus a cup of coffee with 4 oz. unsweetened almond milk and a Splenda. (Breakfast total: 400 cal)  \n\n* 1) half a frozen banana, a cup of frozen, unsweetened strawberries, 2-3 cubes of spinach, two scoops of Trader Joe's plain soy protein powder, and 1.5 cups of unsweetened almond milk \n\n* 2) half a frozen banana, a cup of frozen, unsweetened mixed berries, 2-3 spinach cubes, 2 scoops of TJ's plain soy protein, 1.5 cups unsweetened almond milk, and cinnamon (OMG...mmm)\n\n* 3) a whole frozen banana, 2-3 spinach cubes, 1 tbsp cocoa powder, 2 tbsp chocolate PB2, 2 scoops TJ's plain soy protein, 1.5 cups unsweetened almond milk (this one tastes just like a milkshake and it's incredible)\n\nHaving a few smoothies in rotation helps keep me from getting too bored with them.\n\n**Lunch**\n\n1 cup of homemade turkey chili (290 calories) in a Thermos, or a piece of cheese rolled up in a big piece of turkey lunchmeat, secured with toothpicks and cut into a couple of pieces (appr. 200 calories) and a Kind or Luna Protein bar (190-200 calories). Lunch total: 300-400 cal\n\n**Snacks**\n\nA light Babybel cheese, roasted unsalted nuts, air-popped popcorn (popped at home in a paper bag), or my emergency on-the-road, gotta-have-something-salty snack, Pop Chips or Special K cracker chips (single serve), pickles (mmm...pickles)\n\n**Dinner**\n\nSome protein and a vegetable. [This fish Veracruz recipe is a favorite of mine.](http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Fish-Veracruz-Style) I love to roast or grill chicken and serve with roasted Brussels sprouts, asparagus or steamed broccoli. Chicken sausages (AmyLu makes some really good ones, as does Trader Joe's) tend to be low in calories (but high in sodium!) and make a great quick dinner with some broccoli or cauliflower. Frozen shrimp are also a favorite around here, since they are quick to thaw and you can just do a shrimp cocktail or throw them on the grill for a minute. \n\n**Dessert**\n\nNot something I eat every night anymore, but I like the different Skinny Cow chocolates that come in a single-serve package every once in a while. \n\n**Fast food in a pinch**\n\n* El Pollo Loco: chicken tostada bowl, no rice, no shell, lite cilantro dressing. Under 400 cal.\n\n* Subway: 6\" chicken or turkey sandwich, no mayo, avocado, mustard, and veggies. Under 400 cal.\n\n* Chipotle: Burrito bowl, no rice, barbacoa, fajitas, hot salsa, corn salsa, guacamole...~500 cal\n\n\nExercise has also been an important part of my weight-loss so far, as well as giving me an enormous boost to my well-being. In fact, when I went to the doctor this week for the second round of a vaccination, my blood pressure was back in the NORMAL range!!!!! :D I am so happy about this! Pre-hypertension blood pressure is the whole reason I got started on this journey so I was STOKED! I'm slowly adding more and more workouts into my week, finding that I am enjoying exercise more and more. \n\n* Body Pump at my local gym 2x per week.\n* Swimming laps for at least 30 minutes at least 1x per week.\n* 30 Day Shred at home on the days where I'm strapped for time (1-2x per week)\n* Overall being more active...riding bikes on the weekend, trying new classes at the gym, etc. I found a trainer that I want to start working with in order to start lifting heavier weights. \n\n\nBasically, I've only lost 13 pounds but I feel tons better about myself. I've lost 3 inches from my waist. I'm in better shape, I fit in my clothes from 2-3 years ago, I'm paying attention to what I eat, when and WHY, I'm sleeping better and waking up more easily in the morning. The other day my husband looked at me, sweaty and exhausted in my gym clothes, and he said, \"Wow, you look GOOD.\" I know he finds me attractive but the way he said it, it was a big endorsement and was very encouraging.\n\nI've got LoseIt to thank for my progress so far. This sub is so encouraging and supportive, I love checking in and seeing how everyone is doing. Thanks guys! I'll do another big post in a few months :)","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1aou9h/starting_out_f510196lb/\"&gt;My first post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey Loseit!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been looking forward to making this post!
