So sorry if the following rant would seem redundant, but still.\n\nLate Norm McDonald had that famous \"I'm not a real welder\" joke. I myself am not a real mathematician. I've always been fascinated with pure math, with it's rigor, it's clever methods, it's mind-blowing insights. Yet I've never really had a chance to properly learn it. My bachelor's was in software engineering, my master's – in so called \"applied mathematics and informatics\". All the \"math\" for those 6 years was basically just linear algebra + calculus + some elements of discrete math, then ODE's, basic probability theory, statistics\/data analysis, a bit of cryptography and numerical analysis, that's it for the most part. All of those taken with the approach \"more calculations, less proofs\".\n\nSince I graduated, I taught myself some algebra (mostly from van der Waerden and Atiyah &amp; McDonald) and topology (mostly Hatcher), but it took me literally years due to, you know, time-consuming adult stuff. Bills usually don't pay themselves, so I was mostly concentrated on these issues.\n\nAnd now I'm 31 and finally got a job that is both financially stable and not so stressful (probabilistic modelling for a betting office), so it leaves some room for learning math again. \n\nBut now I feel like I'm really missing out. And the more I try to learn some more advanced stuff (beyond Hartshorne and Hatcher), the more I feel frustrated. I try to read books and watch online lectures, but nearly every time I find myself stumbled upon things like \"As you can easily see, this group is semidirect product of those two groups, so by X, Y and Z theorems, which you obviously know by heart, it's just п_2 of 4-dimentional torus, and the rest is trivial\". And the audience nods in enlightened agreement.\n\nBut no, dude, I don't know every single class of groups like it's 1st-grade arithmetics, I hear about those theorems for the first time in my life, and your conclusion seems not trivial at all! And I definitely can't imagine how those sophomore students are already that skillful in advanced group theory _and_ homotopy theory _and_ homological algebra _and_ K-theory to think otherwise.\n\nEither I'm too slow-thinking and too old to start learning this, or I can't realistically learn this without good tutoring in top university. I can't even decide what's more frustrating. Anyways, it feels like there's a huge gap: you can find either really basic stuff you already know (like explaining what a coherent sheaf is, or calculating simplicial homologies, for instance), or something that takes weeks and hundreds of pages of additional books to even understand a single lecture.

My friend and I found a nice apartment at very affordable rent.\n\nMy monthly income is sufficient to cover rent, estimated utilities, transportation, groceries... My emergency fund can cover a years worth of rent and utilities. I have a remaining amount in my savings that will be used to pay off student loans before I finish school. My major along with the experience I gained will very likely give me a large increase in income within the next 7-8 months when I finish university. \n\nHere is the issue, how do I tell my parents I am moving out? I am not anticipating a smooth reaction, they are overprotective to say the least, even at my age. \n\nHere are things I predict they will react harshly about:\\\nThey want me to wait until I finish school. I am okay with moving out before finishing school. My current job is through the university and I get paid very well for part time so I can focus on studying also.\\\nThe apartment is about 40 minutes away from them and about 50 mins from university. I am fine with driving but they will not like this.\\\nThey never met my to be roommate (I have known him for 3 years) I am thinking of having him present when I tell them, is this a good idea?\\\nI think deep down they do not trust me to live on my own and don't want me making mistakes. They always intervene or direct me so I avoid making harmless mistakes.\\\n\nI know I am an adult, and I feel very well prepared to live on my own. The problem is I am always nervous to tell my parents anything about my life because of a history of negative reactions. I know I should not be concerned if they do not trust me, but I can't help but get nervous telling them I am going to move out, or doing anything really. I am not concerned with my safety btw, just their reactions. What are ways you recommend to handle bad reactions? \n\nThanks for any input, I appreciate it. \n\n---\n**tl;dr**: Moving out soon, and I need to tell my overprotective parents, what are ways you have told your parents and how can I best handle their reactions?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationships","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/relationships","subreddit_subscribers":3227751,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"(22) How to tell overprotective parents I am moving out and handle their reaction?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.94,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/pywdqb\/22_how_to_tell_overprotective_parents_i_am_moving\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I have taken GIS courses, attended the 2017 user conference as well as had a basic GIS internship when in college. I love GIS so started applying for jobs and landed a full time, temporary position as a GIS tech that is supposed to transition into a permanent spot here a few months (took me absolutely forever just to get one job offer for GIS).\n\nBecause my degree is not GIS or geography and I have no educational certification or even a college minor in GIS on my resume, I found it very difficult to get into the field and imagine it would be extremely difficult to get promoted and continue to make more money in the field. For this reason I have been looking into a GIS graduate certificate to grow my knowledge, confidence and resume. Is this a good idea or even worth it? Does anyone have any advice for me on where to go from here because I am at a loss. Would I need to pursue a masters for it to be worth it?\n\nBTW: I have gotten into a couple universities grad programs just have not started classes yet. I personally like the thought of doing more school but only if it is worth it because I will have to take out loans (currently have $0 in loans) and will work full time to cover living expenses.\n\nPlease.

My problem is that my friends (who also don't care that I'm gay) behave a bit different compared to well the other straight friends.  \nAbout me:  \nI'm 16yo and a normal guy, I don't really tell people that I'm gay unless they ask or it is a girl trying something. I do this because I figured that they really don't care. I even had a classmate tell me how I can be so \"normal\" behaving and another gay classmate is this typical picture ppl have when they think about gay guys (it wasn't meant as hate though). In general, people wouldn't know that I'm gay if nobody told them. Also, I might add that we do some gay jokes (me too) so I am very open and don't care bc I also find them funny and know they aren't meant to hurt me  \n\n\nwhat bothers me:  \nI have noticed many times by now that my friend (I guess unintentionally) left me out on some stuff. in  7 grade I had a friend with whom I used to wrestle sometimes and well after he found out that I'm gay it stopped (maybe bc I had a crush on him, but different story, we're still friends), my friends I usually hang out with also sometimes \"wrestle\" and stuff but I'm the only one that well isn't doing it. We are in 10th grade now so it's normal that we behave more mature. I am very ticklish so my friends take advantage of that sometimes and it's funny but I have a tendency to develop a damn deep crush on my friends that last really long so I noticed how they wouldn't really come as close (or long) when tickling\/poking me into my side me than when they do it on others. Then about a month ago when we were out drinking (I'm german btw) another friend that was surprisingly going out with us was drunk and started hugging everyone and when he came to me he said \"I might not hug you, so you don't start liking me\" to which I responded don't worry I won't (so he eventually also hugged me Oof\". This shocked me a bit because now I'm afraid all the time that boys think that I develop a crush on them. \n\nA month ago in my hobby, I noticed how much I missed just doing normal boy stuff every little normal boy does with his friends, stuff I never really was able to do like chasing each other randomly and laughing and wrestling and all that boy stuff Idk how to describe it. I noticed when I went on a field trip with 2 other members and the dude (he's 12yo) and I came along great and I had a feeling I didn't experience for a long time, actual fun, a different kind of fun. Well I know I can't really hang out with 12yo kids and behave like them it would just seem weird especially since my friends already make jokes I like younger dudes (actually no Idea where it comes from   ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_\/¯  )   lately I had a good female friend tell me that when I had fun with another dude that I just wanted to f\\*\\*k him wich I won't deny, he was cute but I want to have fun not make a move on him. I mean why do they always say it, am I not allowed to have fun, only because I do smth. with a dude doesn't mean I wanna bang him. We were doing silly stuff (it was at a MINT-Camp) like running from door to door spying on the others then texting them and awaiting their reaction then knocking and running away. I know this is kindergarten behaviour but I cannot stress how much I missed it, the downside is that all these ppl don't know I'm gay and I only like, meet them once a week or only once at all. I actually thought about searching myself new friends, On the weekends I'm currently going out with some other dude from my class and not my usual friends because he and his friend give even less of a shit than the other apparently do. I was introduced into his friend group with \"hey op, your gay right? well, this is John Doe, he's also gay!\". But I also know I can't stay because when my usual friends say let's drink smth, it's about some beer and a bottle of wine for everybody (I think it's not much), last weekend with the other I drank a bit less than a quarter Jägermeister, 1\/3 of a Berliner Luft bottle some shots and nips of fruit schnapps and half a bottle Havana club...  \n\n\nSo now my question is what do I do, I feel like I just wrote everything from my soul and I doubt that anybody is really reading through this trash and my bad English but I still hope for an answer. I know that there are ppl with bigger problems out there but it was bothering me really hard because I'm not really able to do what I like in my small town. I'm sorry if it sounds weird but I'm sometimes still very childish and miss being childish again even though I'm 16. I know it's kinda weird for my age but I wasn't really able to do these things but stand next to them happening so I feel like I missed out on something.\n\nEdit: it is not like my usual friend are complete a-holes, we still do a lot of \"fun\" stuff but i guess they are afraid i might \"like\" them.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"askgaybros","subreddit_id":"t5_2vgfw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/askgaybros","subreddit_subscribers":325273,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"How to make my (straight) friends behave more normal again?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askgaybros\/comments\/pywthf\/how_to_make_my_straight_friends_behave_more\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I really appreciate having a place to come and read others experiences when in search of motivation.\n\nI want to share a bit of my experience as a 39yo woman.  I am 5'9\", started around 212lbs for reference.\n\nSome history: I was very active growing up. This reached a climax in high school as I was participating in Swim Team, Water Polo, and Women's Softball.  \n\nDuring the swimming years, I my weight would cycle (150lbs up to 165lbs) during times of the year when I was only swimming 5 workouts a week; regular schedule was 9 workouts a week.  After I graduated High school, I enjoyed some down time, more sleep, and started working full time and University full time.  This all filled in the time I used to spend working out.  I gained the usual 15 lbs.   Any attempts to lose weight after this point always ended up with me losing successfully but eventually gaining to a higher weight than I was to begin with. I found that I have specific weights that my body tends to 'fall' into.  150, 165, 180, 195, 215....\n\n216 is the highest my weight has ever been.  I've been thinking about what to do about it for some time, but have not been motivated enough to do something about it till I recently got engaged.  The thought of having to look at my wedding photos at 200+ lbs for the rest of my life has managed to light the fire. \n\nMy Fiancé suggested I read Tim's book as I was in the stage of working out and eating less, but not a specific diet.  \n\nI had heard him talk about Ferris and his recommendations many times, but this deep dive into the book exposed the true obsession he had with all things Tim Ferris. \n\nI read the book in 3 days. I started with chapters that are available for free, and within a day purchased the book.  I know that's not how it was meant to be read, but I wanted to know all the things and what to do as fast as possible.  It was a blind commitment to a diet that I was told worked the best of any diet my fiancé had ever tried.  He is well read and versed in all things diet, exercise, and Tim Ferris.  \n\nSince the first reading, I have it available on my phone to pull up and reference at any time.  This makes getting the source and questions answered particularly easy.  I am of the opinion, if I am going to do something, give it all the effort and get results as fast as possible.  Given that I work full time and we have 3 kids running around, this is what I have been able to cram into my life.\n\n\\----------\n\nSlow Carb Diet .... no cheating at all, except for the single Cheat day of course.  I track my food &amp; supplements in MyFitnessPal to be sure I am not eating things I am not accounting for.\n\n30 grams of protien within 30 minutes of waking\n\n1000ml of ice cold water within 30 minutes of waking\n\nCold Showers at least once a day \n\nPAGG\n\nCissus on Cheat Days\n\nExercise - a moderate swim workout 1-2x a week\n\nMeasurements before food or water on the day before cheat day, this way I don't have to 'wait' to stuff my face......after the recommended water, eggs, lentils, protien, PAGG, Cissus, insoluble fiber and Fructose.... of course!\n\n\\---------\n\nThings I could be better at:  \n\nDrinking more water consistently throughout the day and making sure I am eating enough of the lentils. I have reached the point where there are times I am starving and times I have to force myself to eat. I rarely feel deprived. I add the foods I crave to a cheat day list and am sure to indulge on the next cheat day.\n\n\\--------\n\nCurrent Results\n\nI noticed an immediate reduction in inches.  My first week I lost almost 4 inches!!! \n\nThank god that my Fiancé was doing my measurements for me. If not for these, I would not have any idea what I had lost.  My weight remained the same for 3 weeks!\n\nOver the last 4 weeks, I have consistently lost between 1-3 inches a week.  As mentioned in Tim's comments on when women start to see the effects of the diet on their weight, I am utterly average.  I am in week 5 and the scale just dropped 3lbs.  So overall I am 4 lbs down.  \n\nEven with the measurements and the weight documented, this doesn't address the true change that has happened over the last 5 weeks.  My body composition is very different now.  Ive lost much more fat than 4 lbs. I am down an entire Bra Band Size, down to a 10 pant size (no muffin top) and am feeling slender even though the scale still says over 200lbs.  I tried on the same wedding dress week 3 and week 4 and it fit dramatically different. \n\nMy biggest takeaway's so far are:\n\n1. Take before photos (Front, Side, Back, Side - with limited clothing and with arms up and down) - I know its embarrassing...even when you are taking them of yourself.  I found a way to do it in a bathroom where I can set my phone on the sink and video record to get the screenshots. My 'before' photo is terrible, so now I have to compare with week 2 photos instead of when I started.  It's more than worth it in the end.  I find looking at them helps me when I feel that I am not making progress.  You don't have to share them with anyone, just keep them to yourself.  Guaranteed when you have some results under your 'belt' ;)  you will be more than happy to show them off.\n2. Take weekly photos (same poses for comparison) \n3. BE SURE TO MEASURE!!!!\n4. Just do it....don't analyze it.  I have done all the diets out there, and this is different.  I am losing weight different than I ever have before.  I notice it in different areas each week, instead of just feeling like my entire body is atrophying in the same shape.  (examples:  week 1 - hips, week 2 - mid and lower back, week 3 - upper back etc) \n5. Lose the obsession with the scale - I am still working on this, but the more inches I lose the more evident to me that the number doesn't really matter.  Doesn't mean I still don't want it to go down faster ;)\n6. Cheat like you mean it!  Considering cheat days have been chocked full of sugar, chips, pizza, nachos, and even a full day of beer at Oktoberfest, I feel like I am still eating the same quantity of the bad things....I have just rearranged when I eat them.\n\nThis week I am adding kettlebell swings (twice a week) and adding a second cold shower every day.\n\nWish me luck!\n\nCJ","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"4hourbodyslowcarb","subreddit_id":"t5_2sk62","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/4hourbodyslowcarb","subreddit_subscribers":27445,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Slow Carb First Timer - 39yo Female","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.92,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/4hourbodyslowcarb\/comments\/pywtjy\/slow_carb_first_timer_39yo_female\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

there you wonderful kinky and fun individuals and welcome to my world of HORNY because yah i'm really wanting to get some nice detailed roleplaying going on again so let's get to the good stuff ~  But first we have some rules we have to go over, don't worry it won't take too long and i'll be sure to include lots of little fun details for you all to enjoy!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RULES-**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n- I am 22, all characters portrayed in this roleplay will be above the age of 18 with no expedition!**\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- I am a pretty extreme submissive with pretty much no dominant intentions, and while I can fake being dominant here and there for instructional purposes such as making examples, I do not dominate others in roleplay!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- I have a heavy preference for females and futa dominates but if you are a guy and wanna play female or futa  that is also 100% fine with me. If you wanna play as a guy you will have to convince me to rp but it is not impossible. Skill with favorite kinks, good plots, and generally being nice really helps!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- I have lots of images and captions that i have collected over quite some time if you want reference images from me please state what you are seeking, yah know male female futa ect give me some idea of what ya want thanks**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- When you send me a message I will need more than just a simple hello. Introduce yourself, send images of characters from shows ya like being good and lewd. Give me something fun to read that will make me wanna roleplay with ya heck roleplay examples are great incentive double if they are about kinks i truly adore! As well say: Sexy Swaying Hips~ in your first message its our little secret!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- I Play male female futa and femboy characters although I have more male female and femboy images than anything else so please be patient if you want something specific. Now i also 99.9% of the time play as ocs as they are just something i greatly prefer to play as**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry about all of that, these are pretty basic and well i would greatly prefer to follow them. Now because I made ya read through all of this I will be putting a full imgur link at the end of this post and you can enjoy the 50 lewd images I will be giving all of you. They include some of my favorite kinks and the like as well. Be sure to read the captions and I'm sure you will understand what my favorite kink is. Now then we will be talking in depth about some of the kinks from my somewhat extensive list then i'll give you the entire list so don't worry~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**-Humiliation~**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is one of those strange kinks for me, I'm not sure why I like it there really is no key event or singular aspect about it I like. Force me to walk around naked while on a leash. Isolate me from those who try to bring my character up. Take away my name and call me whatever degrading term you desire, heck even force me into prostitution public use and th eliek for your profit just come up with something interesting for this one in particular.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Latex~**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAh yes the tight grip of latex against smooth skin~ feeling it constrict against each and every part of my body. Feeling layer after layer applied as it binds my arms back uncomfortably leaving my body exposed and usable to anyone! If you can not tell I adore this kink in particular I love this stuff and my main thing is application~ How did you get me bound up in latex! A trick? Technology? Did I get  into this situation of my own accord? There are many possibilities! And i would love to explore this kink in more detai with ya~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Maids~**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know a single person who doesn't like a good dominant maid~ as an archetype. I love to combine this with hypnosis, mind control, feminization and lots of other kinks for the sake of diversity! I find this to be one of those kinks you don't really have to explain so if you want to explore this kink with me then just say so but you will have to come with a good plot and a few other kinks under your belt if you wanna get it off the ground!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that we have talked about a few kinks i will be giving you all a full list of each and every kink i have this list will have a few kinks bolded these are personal favorites of mine and well i adore them more than anything really but i would need any rp including them to be really detailed or really fun~ Say at least one of the bolded kinks as a secondary password cuties ~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kinks:*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n \n**Characters**, Mind break, **Hypnosis**, Brainwashing, Corruption, Mind Fuck {Literal and Not}, Feet {Female\/Futa only}, **Gentle Dominant, Strict Dominant, Motherly Dominant, Teasing Dominant**, Extreme Dominant, **Loving\/Caring Dominant**, BDSM, **Latex**, Bondage, Toys, Stockings, Public Sex, Humiliation, Degradation, Loss Of Control, Kidnapping, Gangbangs, IQ Loss, Dominant Femboys, Dominant Traps, Femboys, Traps, **Feminization**, **Transformation**, Tomboys, Stockings, Uniforms, Sexy Clothing, Collars, **Non-Human Characters**, Futa, Large Breasts, Thick Thighs, Large Asses, Aphrodisiacs, Panzuri, Thigh Jobs, Foot Jobs, **Edging, Orgasm Denial, Orgasm Control**, Oral, Anal, Training, Technology, Fantasy, Magic, Breast Smothering, Possession, Addictive Cum, Addictive Scent, Addictive Milk, Lactation, Maids, Heroes, Villains, Powers, Non- Con, Pet Play, Toys, Vibrators, Body Worship, paws {fem}, paw worship {fem}, **Forced Body Worship**, Sweat, Face Sitting,  others i can't remember\n \n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n \n**Limits**\n \n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n \nGore, Vore, Weight gain, Blood, Scat, Self-harm\n \n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow then we will chat about the settings that i like to play around in, there are really only two but i will play around in others these will however be the ones i can do the most in as i have the greatest amount of experience with these types of settings! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Fantasy**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love me some fantasy settings, i'm a huge d and d nerd so if you wan ado dungeons and deviants then we can talk no matter what~ HIgh fantasy is a preferred environment for rme with magic and monsters everywhere but i am not going to say no to low or mid fantasy settings! Fantasy can include a massive array of kinks and all of my favorites fit into this particular setting genre so dont worry ill most likely be able to come up with something fun for us to do here if you can't~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Alt earth\/ Slight future**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA setting that is very common but also very fun allowing for different technologies, people and events. This also encompases canonical earth worlds for me so things like the dc universe marvel and the like can be considered part of this setting package should you wana do anything with this kind of setting. It also just lets us have a lot of freedom with whatever we wanna do! Sorry that this is so short but it is one of the two settings I use most often!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow then we will be getting into a few characters that I would love to have dominante me into the ground. I will not be giving the entire list here but that is available on request if you just ask nicely. Same goes for the kink list above if you don't feel like coming back here every time you wanna see it! Anyway let's get to the characters then~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Batgirl{DC}**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBarbra Gordon better known as batgirl is definitely one of those characters i want to destroy me, mind and body. Working long nights fighting crime in a light latex suit building up sweat needing release~ oh boy do i think she would make for a great dominant. Maybe im a young ruffian who is taught an extra special lesson dragged back to her apartment and turned into her personal maid and sidekick~ maybe i get captured by a new device of hers a grenade that completely envelops me in skin tight latex that i cannot escape~ i feel she would make for so many good plots!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n{she works best either as a corrupted hero or as someone who thinks they are doing good by turning ruffians into loyal cute toys for her use! Sorry there is not a ton of extra detail here but i hope she interests you~}\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Palutena {Kid Icurus}**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lovely goddess of light and ruler or angelland~ powerful and dominant to the extreme what does she seek! Maybe a new maid to keep her home clean, a new slut to take her aggression out on a lovely wife or husband, perhaps she just wishes to have a new seat. For whatever reason she has decided to seek someone out on her own for this new role~ Magic, power, body worship, there are so many kinks this lovely goddess would probably love to use on a new toy~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n{ No real plot idea for this lovely lady but hey that doesn't matter that much she is around here for the fun and enjoyment of everything~}\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cerberus the triple demon {Helltaker}**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAh the dog eared demons from hell yes yes yes yes i adore these lovely gals and well guess what i have so many weird ideas that I would love to use with these cuties as my dominants. Being demons they can alter their form but what else can they alter. One idea was they could alter their body fluids and cum latex all over my body~ change their fluids to be highly addictive even their kisses and saliva i think they are just so interesting!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n{All i have to say is that we should definitely corrupt the mortal realm and have a blast doing it!}\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Azula {Avatar the last Airbender}**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo then if you have ever been on the internet or at least even been near where i have been you have definitely seen the fire nation victory AU where everyone winds up becoming brainwashed loyal citizens of the great fire nation. So I can definitely see Azula helping to train a brand new personal Attendant~ and I hope you can see that as well! Not much else to say here! So get ready to brand me however ya like~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n{Not a ton to say here sorry about that but hey she would definitely be fun~}\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Raphtalia{ Shield Hero}**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAh yes the cute racoon girl who knows what it is like to be abused and beaten down, I believe she would make for an amazing caring loving dominant never mean never unkind just strict in what she desires from the one she is training, helping and in her own mind saving! She would definitely be a ton of fun in my opinion!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n{Not a ton to say here either but she could also be replaced by any generic former slave in a fantasy setting if you dont wanna use her!}\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd guess what there are plenty more where that came from so don't worry I won't exclude any character just say who they are and i'll definitely consider it! If you want the full list of characters i'll definitely provide it on request that sall you have t do ask and you shall receive~ mention a character in your opening message as well please~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Contact info and pictures!~**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**KIK: Etresta**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTELEGRAM: Kitsunesweety\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPics as a reward~ https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/1zyEotE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLets chat soon cuties read carefully and send me a message as soon as ya can!~&lt;3","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DirtyKIKRoleplay","subreddit_id":"t5_3kem5","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/DirtyKIKRoleplay","subreddit_subscribers":57667,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[A4A] Hey Lets Have Fun~","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DirtyKIKRoleplay\/comments\/pywupt\/a4a_hey_lets_have_fun\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

So stupid.) and thought I sprained it again after the fall. I couldn't get up so I was sent to the hospital because the EMT thought I tore a ligament. The MRI showed that I have a chronic avulsion fracture of the lateral malleolus with marrow oedema in the avulsed fragment indicating acute on chronic injury. ATFL nearly completely attached to this fragment shows grade II sprain. CFL has a grade II sprain. Superficial deltoid severe sprain versus low-grade partial tear. No osteochondral lesion seen.

It does seems like it’s slowing the leveling down abit keeping them kinda current m. Also I’m lvl 22.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"newworldgame","subreddit_id":"t5_3gmxe","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/newworldgame","subreddit_subscribers":263624,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Gathering","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.67,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/newworldgame\/comments\/pywy9x\/gathering\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

all, I am browsing fb marketplace for a used road bike. I am new to road bikes and don't know much about them so I would love some help choosing one that is the best for my fit and purposes.\n\nI mostly ride my bike for commute in the city in Boston, running errands and for leisure on paved bike trails, occasionally on unpaved trails (I would like to have the option to). I am interested in having a bike that I can use as a touring bike to go on bike packing trips where I pack light (\\~10 lb gear). On my last bike trip I used panniers attached onto a rear rack and I liked that setup. I recently rode on my friend's road bike (Giant Contend AR 4) for the first time and loved the feeling of gliding through the air, I've never experienced that on my hybrid bike before (Retrospec Mantra 7). I would like a bike that has a nice feeling while riding but isn't too aggressively built for speed so that over long periods of riding while carrying some load, it will still feel comfortable.\n\nI am also confused about sizing - I think the bikes I have picked out are in my size range? I am 5'3 and my inseam is 30 inches. I would also appreciate some pointers about what to look out for when I go try the bikes, and what kind of information\/photos would be useful to ask for (some of these places are 1 hr + away and I would need to rent a van to go there and transport the bike).

It starts off pretty simple.  I walk into the bar with a huge smile on my face, I just closed a big contract with one of my best clients and I am looking to celebrate.   I have picked up a hooker here before so when I see a beautiful woman in a sexy outfit sitting at the bar by yourself talking to the bartender.  I automatically assume….\n\nAs I walk over to you I am super pumped up all smiles and in a confident voice..…”hey is this seat taken?  I am from out of town…My name is Mike…”. I hold my hand out as I don’t wait for the answer and pull the bar stool out\n\nI sit down I am confident that I am talking to a hooker and start making small talk. But who are you really?  A down on her luck waitress, a married woman out of town on business or maybe just a college girl that got separated from her friends.   It would be ideal if you were having money problems?  Like you need money for car repairs, an unexpected medical bill or just money to pay for college books.. \n\nI am a typical high level business man, a VP that is recently divorced and has way more money than I have time for relationships.  I am 45 yrs old, short blonde hair blue eyes and wearing a dark Armani’s suit.  \n\nEventually I ask you up to my room clearly there is a misunderstanding and you get a little pissed, of course you are not that kind of girl.  When I explain that I thought you were a hooker, that doesn’t really help.  But I was expecting one!  You are curious and you ask questions about how much I pay and what services I want?  Of course you need the money don’t you.  This ends up being a pretty involved discussion.  Of course it’s a lot of money maybe $1000 bucks could be more..what does it take to get you in bed for a few hours.  \n\nOf course I have some things I want …you have to enjoy it…there is a bonus for Anal?  How much is ATM?  I want to push your limits…\n\nKinks include:  oral, anal, corruption, outfit\/orgasm control, hair pulling, spankings as punishments, humiliation, dirty talk\n\nLimits: severe pain, blood, kids","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dirtypenpals","subreddit_subscribers":458314,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"M4F The reluctant hooker, just a little misunderstanding","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtypenpals\/comments\/pyx9mi\/m4f_the_reluctant_hooker_just_a_little\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I would answer that I don’t actually know, however I do know that it’s not something masc. Also when someone refers to me as a man\/male(I’m born male) it would just feel wrong and it would just make me uncomfortable, but when someone refers to me as a boy, it doesn’t bother as much, does that mean I don’t have gender dysphoria? Because I’ve heard that when trans people get misgendered, they would feel really strong emotions.

It's so hard for me to get up, and make myself dinner, and get ready for bed. And I do, eventually, I just feel off. It's like im looking at my life through a glass window. I end up feeling lazy because of it, but I try not to guilt myself to much, since it dosent help if I feel worse. \n\nI don't have any mental issues, except that I'm stressed out all the time but who isn't lol.\n\nI heard some people talk about that if they live by themselves, and have nobody around they can't take care of their basic everyday needs.

me tell you about my ultimate fantasy; *wrestling with a girl for sexual domination.*\n\nMy favorite scenarios include:\n\n* SexFight: Winner forces the loser to cum. This is also my favorite.\n* Ultimate Surrender: Self-explanatory if you know what it is. Wrestling bouts where you fight for submissions as well as sexual prowess over your opponent.\n* Domination: Winner beats the loser by pin, submission, or knockout. The winner fucks the loser. \n\nIf you decide to message me, I would love to know how you would prefer to set up our match. **Please include what type of match you would prefer fighting in; as well as a list of your fetishes.**\n\n* Underground Wrestling League: A Rookie goes into his first match?\n* College: The rival Sorority\/Fraternity sends their best fighters for control of the school.\n* Ronda Rousey: Ronda wants to get dirty, but she does it the only way she knows how. \n* Do you have your own? Or do you not care and want to get to the fight?\n\nI would describe myself as a cocky guy with Dom qualities, but I have had the desire to be broken down into a submissive. Not with whips and chains, but with your superior physical\/mental\/sexual strength.

Hi! Im horrible at starting things so im just gonna jump in I am your average twenty something with one addition, loving dominant women. What can I say, Vanilla is boring and I feel like I can be myself with a dom. I am 6'1 ive got brown hair that I like to keep short(ish), brown eyes, brown glasses :P , and have one tattoo. I have a very unserious demeanor, I get depressed easily so its best to treat everything as a joke. That being said I absolutly love new experiences. anything from trying a new resturant, Trying to bake a new pie, or driving down a road to just to see where it leads. If im not doing any of those things you can find me at home with my cat trying to find a better job or browsing the interwebs\n\nSo what am I looking for? Well the easy answer is a dominant women to talk to, mess around with, bond with, and if the stars align start a relashonship with. But beggers cant be choosers so if you want something casual I could always use a dopamine hit.\n\nKinks wise I love so many and want to experiment with even more that I find it easier to list the kinks that I wont touch with a 10 foot pole. Those being Forced Bi, Exhibition, scat and piss, Harsh pain or torture,Findom, and Cuckolding. On a side note, if anyone reading this is looking for a brat sorry I really dont have that in me ive tried.\n\nLastly I understand your a real person with emotions, not a kink dispenser. I hope you think of me the same way, I wont be able to respond asap all the time even though I want to and I wont trust you right away im sorry theres to many scammers around.  \n \nIf you got to the end here is a pic so you can see if you like :P https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Dodv8qQ","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"femdompersonals","subreddit_id":"t5_2xp8o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/femdompersonals","subreddit_subscribers":74542,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"25 [M4F] #NewMexico\/Online Your typical sub looking for something gentler","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/femdompersonals\/comments\/pyxw8j\/25_m4f_newmexicoonline_your_typical_sub_looking\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

And what I mean by that is I'll take a quick 20-minute nap on my couch, I'll wake up and the only thing I can do is stare at my phone. It's so hard for me to get up, and make myself dinner, and get ready for bed. And I do, eventually, I just feel off. It's like im looking at my life through a glass window. I end up feeling lazy because of it, but I try not to guilt myself to much, since it dosent help if I feel worse.\n\nI don't have any mental issues, except that I'm stressed out all the time but who isn't lol.\n\nI heard some people talk about that if they live by themselves, and have nobody around they can't take care of their basic everyday needs.

I'm a patient person and simply stood there on my phone while I waited. A minute later they came up with a friendly \"find everything okay?\" And of course I say yes. \n\nThey then ring it up and go \"let me just make sure this works.\" And to my absolute horror opens the box and pulls out the damn thing out with their bare hands. They then go on to show me how to charge it and what all the buttons do ect. They put it back in the box and I hesitate, but pay for it. \n\nIt's sat in the box, in the bag, in the living room for at least three days because im so horrified that it happend. Today I was brave enough to try to clean it and im just really worried that the mental image of them handling an item meant for such a delicate place is burned into my head and I'll never be able to use it without flashing back to the thought. \n\nAgain, I'm just wondering if it was okay for them to do?

I can still flex them so I guess my muscles aren't actively doing anything. It occasionally feels sore too. It's similar to the feeling of when you're nearly about to push baby out or the sensation after delivery. I do not believe that I am in labor. But maybe it's some sort of Braxton Hicks symptom? I've been having the random contractions already. This and my last pregnancy both started almost daily BH contractions around 6 months.

I'm Adriana (she\/her\/hers). I'm 21 from Connecticut USA and had my epiphany a few months ago. I'm out to my close friends, my whole family, my psychologist, and now you folks. I'm eager to begin my transition to female. Research is very important to me.\n\n# Wardrobe\n\nWardrobe! Macy's and Forever21. Imma ask the question every transgirl asks: how do you convert between mens sizes and womens sizes? Is it just that I have to take measurements? I want shirts, crop-tops, underwear, jeans, and (casual) shoes. I LOVE COLOR! tie-dye, rainbow, just either a range of bright colors and\/or different shades... What's your advice on how to find the most colorful of the articles listed? Any tips for navigating those two stores in particular? Preferably online?\n\n# Doctors\n\nMy doctor is super inclusive. He is going to research the next steps he needs to take to get me on mtf gcht. My doctor is from UConn and uconn has a good transgender support program [Transgender Medicine Services | UConn Health](https:\/\/health.uconn.edu\/patient-services\/transgender-medicine-services). My psychologist knows the one at Middlesex [Center for Gender Medicine and Wellness \/\/ Middlesex Health](https:\/\/middlesexhealth.org\/center-for-gender-medicine-and-wellness). I've looked at both. I need both. Which do you like better in terms of friendliness, services, and outcomes? for mtf (male to female) gcht (gender confirmation hormone therapy), vfs (voice feminization surgery), ffv (facial feminization surgery), and grs (gender reassignment surgery)? I clarify only to be explicit.\n\n# Before GCHT\n\nEager little me can't! But in the meantime, I'd like to modify my diet to make me feel more feminine. I've assembled a list [pro-estrogen and anti-androgen | Pastebin.com](https:\/\/pastebin.com\/rzEjFcz1). What did I'm miss? What did I get wrong? What would you add or remove? To either segment? What could make me feel more girly? Should I look into gamete preservation before starting?\n\n# Hair removal\n\nHere's the problem(s). I have hair on my face, armpits, arms, nipples (yes I know gross right), my stomach, my privates, my legs. There are options. I have light to ash blond hair. There is electrolysis, IPL, laser, waxing (that doesn't even use wax!). I have athetoid cerebral palsy and low low pain tolerance. HELP?! What combo do you recommend? How do you hire an anesthesiologist? Can hair removal be done in a medical setting? I'm okay with some pain but I have hard limit.s\n\n# Hard questions\n\ngcht, vfs, ffs, grs, oh my word. What is a good body of questions to ask the doctor on the first consult? Meaning... For MTF GCHT, what do I ask the endocrinologist first time we meet? I've started a little list ([gcht questions - Pastebin.com](https:\/\/pastebin.com\/KjRah6kJ)). Even tough ffs, vfs, and grs are years off for me, what good list of questions to email surgeons? To compare multiple surgeons for each surgery?\n\n# Gender transition navigator\n\nMy psychologist is reaching out to the MiddleSex transition navigator. Any tips for introducing myself? for articulating my goals?\n\nI was questioning when I was nine years old. I never told anyone!

Well today I went to my grandpa's house (my moms dad, lived there since the 70's) and lo and behold, a package was waiting for me. I was honestly expecting some sort of legal documents when I saw who it was from. To my complete surprise, it was my baby book that my mom had made me when I was born. I truly thought I would never seen it again, I thought his wife had probably thrown it away just like everything else. There was no letter from him included and he mailed it, even though he live less than 15 miles away. I feel like this is his way if completely erasing my existence...my brother and I don't talk to him because he allowed his wife to mentally\/emotionally abuse us for years while he stood by. Why is he like this? I seriously don't get what I did to him, the same man who promised in my baby book to always love me......\n\nEdited to add: Had a weird conversation with him where he yet again denied the mental\/emotional abuse his wife committed against my brother and I. He used classic gaslighting techniques that he was the victim in this. He ended our conversation with the absolute WEIRDEST prayer (he's NEVER been religious) and then immediately blocked me. This man literally cannot even have a rational conversation  with me....wish I could figure out how to post all the screenshots.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"breakingmom","subreddit_id":"t5_2y6ap","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/breakingmom","subreddit_subscribers":98546,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"NC father sends my baby book","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.95,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/breakingmom\/comments\/pyyir6\/nc_father_sends_my_baby_book\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

At the time I am 15 But have been  studying politics, religion, ideology, etc since I was nine (i had an Asian parent and a parent which was a big political buff.) Ever since I've discovered Peterson my life has been on an upwards spiral and now I am facing two paths. \n\nOne path leads to me going to the Philippines(where I was born) and I study there for a few years and attempt to go to a university in Japan or Korea. \n\nOr as I am i the united states soon I will be given the option of a scholarship(i have no clue full ride or half ride) but ill have to stay in the states until I'm 17-18 to be able to access the fund. the fact being I wanted to go to the Philippines before I was 16. The thing about this path though is i have no idea what id like to do in college, i had a plan when i was going to the Philippines (i hate American universities and colleges especially since i went to an early college and experienced 3 years of hell).\n\n Id study language and take all the knowledge ive gathered and write a book. (which ive been in the process of coming up with concepts, sketching, illustration, etc for about a year now {ive only started sketching a month or two back}) \n\nbut I'm also torn with the fact that i have a friend which has been in a rough spot for a long time now. But over the pass few years ive been helping him out and ive seen him grow astronomically. We planned on going to the Philippines together (he's been on and off about the idea) but now there's the option of me staying in the states I'm absolutely torn. and I'm looking for any kind of advice i can get.   \n\n\nps. The friend is helping me with the book as we speak and we've been working on it together for several weeks now after i introduced it to him. as well sorry for the information dump I'm new to reddit.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"JordanPeterson","subreddit_id":"t5_32jqy","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/JordanPeterson","subreddit_subscribers":283552,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[Letter] Im a student and i need help with a choice.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/JordanPeterson\/comments\/pyykon\/letter_im_a_student_and_i_need_help_with_a_choice\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}
