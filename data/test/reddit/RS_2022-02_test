My grandparents live here well now just my grandpa , my uncle also lives here in the back but he‚Äôs just so awful \n\nMy uncle started his shananigans when I was barley 18 out of high school . My grandparents moved into my house to spend their golden years which I was all for and still am . It started off with him giving attitude for literally no reason and when I asked him what did I ever do to you for you to treat me like that he said sorry he didn‚Äôt realize . \nI accepted and that was all. \n Fast forward to a few months after , my dogs we‚Äôre being over fed and they were so big they couldn‚Äôt breathe and they didn‚Äôt want to do a thing! \n\nI gave them to my mother who doesn‚Äôt live far at all and she whipped them back into shape. When I was packing them up to leave with my mom , there was a mess of the bedding and toys and I was in the other room folding their laundry , he came out and started yelling and cussing and for what ? \n\nHe‚Äôs not a very clean person so idk why he was so bothered. We then got into a big argument and my mom pulled up. He put on THEEE fakest show I‚Äôve ever seen and my mom was at a loss for words as she knows how he is . He then apologized as his reaction was not just and hugged me , which I was not a fan of .\n\nNow I am 22 and it‚Äôs only gotten worse. \nHe has broken my stuff and hides my things , he doesn‚Äôt clean and when he cooks it‚Äôs just a big mess. I have not thrown anything away of his , but if he just leaves it in the sink I put in in a box so I don‚Äôt have to clean it. He recently got diagnosed with a heart condition but when he said he just wanted to co exist I just stared at him because I‚Äôve repeatedly asked him to never talk to me to never touch my things , to not feed my dog and he still does. So when he said that I just stared at him and walked off.\n\nHad he been nice to me as a child , which he was not , had he shown respect to anyone in this household at any time I might have moved past this. \nI need advice on how to stay calm and how to ignore and how to just get by , because any little thing he does sends me to another level of anger at this point . \nThis is about me and him and I didn‚Äôt even try to explain what he‚Äôs done to my dad who owns the home or my grandparents because there is more and I‚Äôm trying not to take it to court . Yes it‚Äôs that serious .

Let's see how many mistakes I can make.  Can't say when this process started for me.  I became acutely aware after a 2nd divorce.  Had moved out of the house and living alone when one day the thought \"I'm going to be the best damn woman in my house\" floated thru my stream of consciousness, I never spoke the words.  Within a couple of months my mind was set and I started down a long winding dead end road that the further down the road you got the harder it became to turn back.  But there were rest stops along the way, enough to get off the road and take a break but not to turn around.  That came together in the last 6 months of 2014.  There was no plan, no check list just when it felt right do it.  Fast forward to right now.  I've been taking a variety of supplements since about the 3rd month and on HRT for 3 years.  Estrogen or more correctly Estradiol self injected quickly became my drug of choice for the rest of my life.  I was an outward looking guy family, friends, needy came ahead of myself in that order.  My emotions were joy or anger, I didn't know who I was.  Feminization has introduced me to myself.  I have learned to feel and to cry and it can be so cathartic to cry for no known reason.  Along the way I completed an MBA in 2018, had my ears pierced and fell in love with earrings!  In a marathon 4 year effort I had all facial and ear hair removed, and eyebrows thinned down and now working on my arms.  A year ago I decided on castration and it wasn't easy, I couldn't undo it.  But I came to grips with my concerns and the process was a smashing success and accelerate my desire to undergo SRS.  I've been dressing female almost exclusively for 3 years now.  And I'd asked my Doctor several times recently for permission to proceed with SRS and 2 weeks ago he told me to find a surgeon.  Does anyone have any recommendations.  OH YES, almost forgot to mention I'm 75 y\/o so I'm hoping to use Medicare for at least part of the cost.  I can't express how wonderful my life has become as I've grown to be Transgender.  I feel like a 25 y\/o with excitement, joy, energy and drive.  For someone who has stumbled through this process with never a plan nor advice, listening only to the inner me, I am ecstatic!  Maybe I can come back to this story later and fill in more of the intentional blank periods as I'm not out to write a book here this evening.  After all, this is the first time in 75 years I've done something like this.  And if you read this far, you have my earnest gratitude, Thank You!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"asktransgender","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4b9","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/asktransgender","subreddit_subscribers":225443,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"An Introduction - How I Got Here","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.86,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/shgqqy\/an_introduction_how_i_got_here\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

It was the summer before her junior year of high school, and everything was going quite well. There was a gorgeous blue sky and about ten miles of roadway to enjoy in her '55 Gullwing. She was listening to Bobi Sinatra, an artist that combined the likes of her father with a new, and quite interesting, fast-paced lyrics.\n\n\\- - -\n\nIt was a typical summer for African-English Elliott Goulbourne as well. He went to work with his beat-up 1940 De Soto coupe in the white side of town. He was shocked that he'd gotten a job as a gardener in a nice neighborhood, as opposed to typical factory or where his grandfather had worked. He too was a high school student, though was starting his sophomore year. As he was one of the few students of his race in the school district, he was often picked on. The same went for when he went home. So to get away from all of that was nice.\n\n\\- - -\n\nGiulia was one of the typical members of an upscale community, and today, Sunday, was the day that she was getting away from all of it. At 6 AM that morning, she had taken the keys to her car (one of the few big things that her parents had let her pay for) and hit the road before her two brothers and two sisters went to church with her parents. When everyone else had woken up, she was gone. She, of course, had left a note in the kitchen stating that she had errands to run.\n\nThe errands portion was the best excuse that she could think of, though was a poor one considering that her trunk space was excruciatingly limited...but oh well. A day without religion was better than a day with.\n\n\\- - -\n\nElliott had finally arrived in the neighborhood he was due to begin working in. He looked down at the note that he had been given and parked near the driveway of the house. Not knowing what to do, he got out of his car and walked to the front door and knocked.\n\nHe was almost answered immediately by a middle-aged woman, who didn't seem to be too pleased.\n\n\"Um, I'm Elliott, the new gardener...\" he began, his Cockney accent quite audible.\n\n\"You're not welcome in my house,\" she sneered. \"Now what company did you say you worked with?\"\n\nHe presented her the page given to him by his boss, the current owner of Martin &amp; Beckett's. \"I can give you the phone number if you need to clarify ma'am.\"\n\nShe took the page from him in a huff and stormed off to the phone in her kitchen, and Elliott was soon accompanied with the sound of woman angrily entering the number on her phone.\n\nThe woman reappeared at her front door moments later, quite displeased with the outcome of the phone call.\n\n\"I'm surprised that they would send one of your kind to work on my garden,\" she grumbled. \"I'll be watching you...\"\n\n\"This shouldn't take me more than an hour or two, miss...I mean, ma'am,\" he replied.\n\n\\- - -\n\nGiulia turned the radio off and began whistling a tune she had heard on the other side of town in the farmer's market. There was just something about the other side of town that was quite pleasing and comfortable. She wasn't sure what it was, but she liked it. Perhaps it was the lack of \"Whites Only\" signs or demands that certain folks enter through the back of the store. Though she may have received some strange looks regarding her presence, she felt at home.\n\nCurrently, she was on her way to a corner store near a railway station. She slowed down to a stop at the intersection and looked both ways before continuing onto 8th Street. After another half mile, she was in a dirt lot where many other folks had parked their cars, though none were quite as nice as hers. She was quite pleased at the sight of an old Lincoln-Zephyr, though.\n\nAfter locking the driver's side door, she headed into the corner store, which had recently been stocked up with salted bread loaves. The attendant, recognizing her almost immediately, said, \"Here for another grocery run, Giulia?\"\n\n\"Sure am!\" she replied.\n\nThe attendant motioned for her to stop walking towards the back of the store.\n\n\"Can I ask you something?\" he said.\n\n\"Sure,\" she replied, \"what is it?\"\n\n\"Do your folks know that you're on this side of town?\" he inquired.\n\n\"I'm not sure why that would matter, Darius,\" she answered. \"This is just as good as the other side.\"\n\n\"You are on the *black* side of town,\" Darius said, rather bluntly.\n\n\"And why should that be a problem? It's just as good as the white side; the food might even be better.\"\n\nDarius smiled weakly. \"Well, when you put it that way...ah hell, I won't hold you up!\" His weak smile turned into a grin.\n\n\\- - -\n\nFifteen minutes after entering, she was ready to pay.\n\n\"Fifteen dollars and eighteen cents,\" Darius said.\n\n\"That's it?\" Giulia replied.\n\n\"Yes, fifteen dollars, eighteen cents,\" he repeated.\n\n\"Don't you think it should be more? Like on the other side, I'd be paying you forty-five or fifty dollars,\" she reached into her overalls and pulled out two twenties, a five, and two ones. \"Here, take forty-seven,\" she said. \"Have a nice day!\" she said as she picked up her groceries and left.\n\n\\- - -\n\nIt was around six in the evening when Elliot completed planting in the third garden that day. He gathered his tools and got into his De Soto and drove down to the office of Martin &amp; Beckett's.\n\nUpon arrival, he dropped off the gardening equipment and walked inside. He was immediately greeted by a well-dressed man in a polo shirt.\n\n\"You're Elliott, right?\" he said with a grin.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Elliott replied, his Cockney accent betraying him once more alongside a nervous smile.\n\n\"You did a fucking incredible job today,\" the man continued, \"I heard that you not only planted three full gardens, but you did it neatly and with good reports from our customers.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Elliott replied. \"I'm not sure what else to say.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm Martin Anderson. I'm the co-owner of Martin &amp; Beckett's,\" the man said. \"Feel free to call me Martin. Say, you prefer to get paid in cash or with a check?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm 16, so I don't think that I can really open up a bank account. Also would be a tad more difficult here than in England with white tellers,\" Elliott said to Martin.\n\n\"Cash it is. Say, are you a Londoner then?\" Martin asked him.\n\n\"I am,\" Elliott answered, \"and how did you know?\"\n\nMartin thumbed through his wallet and handed Elliott sixty-five dollars. \"I have a couple neighbors from there. I hope you have a good rest of your day.\"\n\nElliott was stunned. \"Sixty-five?\" he asked Martin.\n\n\"You did a swell job. Couldn't pay you any less,\" he said with a smile.\n\n\"Thanks!\" Elliott replied. He turned to leave.\n\n\"Elliot?\" Martin called out. Elliott turned to face him. \"Yes?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Stay in school. I can see you have a bright future ahead of you, no matter where you are now.\"\n\n**Ch. 2 - The New Kid**\n\nGiulia's brother Antonio honked at her from his '53 Quattroporte.\n\n\"Get out of the garage! I have to be somewhere!\" he shouted.\n\n\"Where do you possibly have to be at nine in the morning?\" she replied.\n\n\"None-ah ya fuckin' business!\" he replied.\n\nShe was taken aback. \"Are you drunk?\" she replied, startled.\n\n\"Uh, no,\" he snorted. She could smell the alcohol on his breath from where she was standing.\n\n\"I'm painting my car blue today,\" she said. \"Give me your keys.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Unless you want *babbo* to get pissed, then give me your keys,\" she demanded.\n\n\"*Fuck*,\" he muttered. \"Fine.\"\n\n\"*Grazie*,\" she replied.\n\n\\- - -\n\nElliott whistled \"Camptown Races\" as he planted a flower bed lining the boulevard. It was a lovely summer day in 1959, and he was feeling good about his job. He'd made one hundred and ninety dollars his first week on the job, and was quite pleased with his craftsmanship regarding the flower beds and wooden siding that he'd assembled for some of them. Some of the folks he'd planted for even gave him some lemonade.\n\nIt was nine-fifteen and he was already halfway done with the job he'd been given that day. He had checked with the gentleman who owned the house he was at, and the man was quite pleased. He paused for a moment to admire his work. In this mere moment, the homeowner walked out onto his porch.\n\n\"Say, you've done a fine job with those flower beds!\" he called out.\n\n\"Why thank you!\" Elliott replied. \"I'm quite satisfied with my work!\"\n\n\"I have a question for you, young man,\" he replied. \"Do you, by chance, do wooden engravings?\"\n\n\"I've done some woodwork in my sixteen years, though I can't say too much of it,\" he replied honestly.\n\n\"Well, I need some woodwork done, and based on what you've put together in my yard, I think you'd be good for the job.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd have to check with my boss briefly ---\"\n\n\"Oh, don't you worry!\" the man replied. \"I've already spoken with him. He gave it a 'go' when I told him of your work!\"\n\n\"It sounds like a plan then!\" Elliott responded. \"When do you want me to begin? I have three jobs left for today, but I'll see what I can do!\"\n\n\"Don't worry about them. Other gardeners have been fetched already from the business,\" he answered Elliott's unspoken question.\n\n\"So, what do you want me to do, sir? I had thought that Martin &amp; Beckett's was a gardening business.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no, no, young man, they do woodwork as well -- and a fine job too! I've seen many things go up and come from paper to reality in the past thirty years!\"\n\n\"So, what would you have in mind, sir?\"\n\n\"Oh, a covered patio! I've always desired one! I'd build one myself, but my attention span has withered away alongside my ability to do the grunt work I used to.\" The old man paused. \"Oh, how I thoroughly enjoyed my youth. I remember building a treehouse for my brother's children in the thirties. Oh how wonderful it was to implement that design of mine.\" He turned to face Elliott. \"I don't suppose you have any ideas for a patio, do you?\"\n\nElliott chuckled. \"When I was younger, I remember redrawing the floor plan of the house I lived in with secret passageways and interesting new features. Though I didn't have the knowledge to actually assemble such things, I did teach myself the mathematics to see if they held up. My pops would sometimes work to build some of the things that I'd drawn, well, before his injury that put him in that wheelchair.\"\n\n\"Oh, splendid! Oh how I've always loved seeing a youngster's vision come to life! The imagination of today's youth is so wonderful!\" the old man said with great joy.\n\n\\- - -\n\nGiulia was laying down on her front lawn, and staring at the sky above her, watching the clouds pass overhead. Her friend Gerdy was with her, mindlessly filling out a crossword puzzle.\n\n\"Does it ever hurt your head?\" Giulia asked Gerdy.\n\n\"Does what hurt my head?\" Gerdy answered pensively.\n\n\"Being so intelligent that you have to constantly keep your mind stimulated,\" Giulia answered.\n\n\"I don't think that's how intelligence works. Though we do have an Intelligence Quotient system to estimate intellectual capacities, I believe that the system is flawed and we should instead---\"\n\nA loud snort erupted from Giulia's nostrils before Gerdy was able to finish her sentence. She blinked and turned around. \"What?\"\n\n\"Never mind then,\" Gerdy replied.\n\n\"You know Gerdy, there's gonna be someday that you're going to go to a great college and probably help send something to the Moon,\" Giulia began, \"but for now, just chill the fuck out and enjoy this wonderful summer day.\"\n\nAnd seconds later...it began to rain.\n\n\"Why in the fuck shit did I say anything,\" she grumbled. \"Okay, let's go inside. I actually have shit to do today.\"\n\n**Ch. 2 - The Next Week**\n\n*It's five PM. The streets are empty, the city is quiet, and not a sound can be heard. The year is 1997, and I am alone in this world.*\n\nElliott put down his pen and sat back at his desk to read and admire what he had written. It was only the first three sentences but it seemed like a good place to start. He had big dreams and aspirations, but constantly doubted himself.\n\n\"I supposedly am now living in the land of the free, yet I can't do the same things that crackers do without being second-guessed. Bloody hell,\" he said aloud.\n\n\"Oi! You alright in there?\" his father Abeo asked.\n\n\"Yes, Pop, I'm alright,\" he answered, \"I'm just a tad fed up with how things are in this blasted country.\"\n\n\"I know! It's bleeding atrocious!\"  Abeo replied.\n\n\"I'm going back to writing my screenplay,\" Elliott announced.\n\n\"Ok,\" his father answered.\n\n\\- - -\n\nGiulia put Antonio's Maserati in park in the driveway. She had fixed the suspension after he had gone for a drunk drive around the block. She rested her head against the steering wheel.\n\n\"I am the third oldest yet I am the responsible one. I am the responsible one,\" she repeated. \"Goddammit.\"\n\nShe took the key out of the ignition and stormed inside. She turned the corner out of the garage and ascended the staircase. She then checked her father's -- Giovanni's -- study, and was thankful to find her father there.\n\n\"Is my idiot brother home?\" she asked, worlds beyond irritated.\n\n\"Yes, and I'd prefer it if you stopped referring to him that way,\" Giovanni stated. \"He's your brother, you should have more respect.\"\n\n\"Why? He's drunk half the time, and I'm cleaning up his messes every other damn day,\" she replied. \"I just fixed his fucking car for the twelfth time this year.\"\n\n\"Why must you swear so much?\" her father asked as he slammed his pen on his desk.\n\n\"I'm irritated?\" she stormed off to Antonio's room.\n\n\\- - -\n\nAntonio heard a pounding on his door. He was listening to Elvis again. There was something about his music that resonated with him. He set down the wine bottle he'd snagged from his father's wine cellar and opened the door.\n\nHis sister, Giulia, pissed out of her mind, stood there with the keys to his car in her hand.\n\n\"This is the twelfth time I've fixed your fucking car. Sober up, or someone else will have your car,\" she sneered.\n\n\"Dad!\" he called down the hallway. \"Did you give Giulia permission to sell my car?\"\n\n\"Not this again,\" his father grumbled from the study.\n\nHe smirked, and Giulia slapped him.\n\n\"Why the hell do you insist on fixing it yourself anyways?\" he said. \"There are plenty of ni----\" Giulia slammed her fist into his gut.\n\n\"Don't. Call them that,\" she stood over him with fury in her eyes.\n\n\"Fine! *PEOPLE OTHER THAN YOU can fix it*. Better?\"\n\nGiulia continued to give him her death stare.\n\n\"This isn't about who fixes your car,\" she replied grimly. \"It never was.\" She threw his keys through a gap between the floorboards.\n\n\"Hopefully you'll be sober by the time you get those out.\" She vacated his room and disappeared around the corner.\n\n\\- - -\n\nIt was nearing ten o'clock, the sky was dark, and the streets were cordoned off. Five cars sat at the starting line, and among them were a brand-new 1960 Chevy C10, a beat-up '58 Coupe DeVille, a red '55 Thunderbird, a newer '59, and a 1955 300SL Gullwing. Giulia, in her 300SL, glanced over at her competition. Gordon Petty was in his \"stars and bars\" clad '59 Thunderbird.\n\n\"You ready to lose in that piece of Euro trash?\" Gordon yelled from his T-bird.\n\n\"This Euro trash is going to be a museum piece in fifty years,\" she responded.\n\n\"Whatever, bitch! A woman belongs in the kitchen, and a man should be her benefactor,\" Gordon sneered.\n\n\"I bought this myself, work my ass off despite coming from a wealthy family, yet I'm being lectured by a 25-year-old daddy's boy who hasn't spent a dime in his life?\" she announced loud enough for their audience to hear.\n\nLaughter erupted from the crowd.\n\n\"Duane!\" she called to one of the on-lookers. Duane came over to Giulia's car.\n\n\"What's up?\" he said.\n\n\"Who's in the '58 Caddy?\" she asked.\n\n\"No one knows,\" he replied. \"Some newcomer from out-of-town supposedly. I've never seen that car before tonight.\"\n\n\"This will be quite interesting then,\" she replied.\n\n\"Don't let your guard down,\" he warned her, \"I've heard that some of these guys don't like to play nice.\"\n\nMinutes later, five engines roared to life, and seconds after the word \"go\" was yelled loud enough to wake the livestock of a nearby farmhouse. The drivers were off on the five-mile dash to the finish line. \n\n\\- - -\n\nThe driver of the Coupe DeVille was a dark-skinned, well-practiced driver with a long history of racing in the family. He himself was a mysterious and unknown figure in this small town, though his father was known as \"the Adversary\" and had been a force to be reckoned with on the race track.\n\nAhead of him were the C10 and a '55 Thunderbird, struggling to navigate the sharper turns on the roadways marked for tonight's race, which made the driver chuckle as he waited to overtake them. At the two-and-a-half-mile-marker came a straightaway, at which he took the opportunity to swing out and lay down on the accelerator. \n\n95. 100. 105. 110. 115. 120. The speedometer rushed to the Coupe DeVille's modified top speed of one hundred and seventy. \n\nDespite his impressive overtake of his fellow drivers, he couldn't help but notice the sea blue '55 Gullwing racing towards him. In the depths of his mind, he couldn't help but be impressed that not only was his competitor challenging him in what was typically a garage queen if not on a racetrack, but that his fellow competitor did not seem overly consumed with toxic masculinity. The competitor was a *woman.*\n\n\\- - -\n\nIt was Mile 3, and Giulia had the obnoxious and the knife-in-the-bollocks pain-in-the-ass Gordon Petty riding her ass as she overtook the '55 Thunderbird and C10 ahead of her in the race. Gordon's supercharged '59 T-Bird was proving to be a truly challenging opponent, though Giulia had a few tricks up her sleeve. Gordon was more or less joyriding, while Giulia was *actually racing*. A 330-degree turn was not too far ahead, and she boldly guessed that Gordon was most certainly unprepared for it.\n\nShe guessed correctly, and Gordon's overprivileged ass overshot the turn and spun out. She slowed down and gracefully completed the turn. The Couple DeVille was not too far ahead and she believed that he too would not be too much to handle. \n\nThe growl of a wild and untamed beast unlike she'd ever heard erupted from the Cadillac ahead. Flames popped out of the tailpipe and the driver of the DeVille thrust the accelerator to the floor. In mere seconds, the DeVille gained one hundred yards between itself and the bumper of Giulia's Gullwing.\n\nShe guessed correctly, and Gordon's overprivileged ass overshot the turn and spun out.

I grew up in a very strict household with outdated beliefs. My mother stayed at home and father worked. My parents were toxic and always tried to convince me that my purpose was to get married, have kids and be a housewife. No offense to anyone who is a housewife. The problem with my parents though is they were misogynistic and felt women belonged in the kitchen. This was a huge conflict I had with them and caused resentment as I got older, moved out, graduated college and started working as a nurse. Eventually, I did meet someone and get married. We have a 4 year old daughter together which she was fully planned.\n\nUnfortunately the marriage didn't last and we divorced over a year ago so now we coparent. My ex-husband has been self-employed since we originally got married so his schedule is very flexible compared to mine. When we were still married, he would either watch our daughter while I worked at the hospital or have his parents watch her. Since the divorce, every time I had work on a day that my daughter wasn't able to attend daycare or preschool, my ex or his parents would watch her. Also whenever there was an emergency, I had my ex pick up our daughter from daycare or school instead of me taking off work. We have split custody but he's been willing to watch her during my days when I can't due to work.\n\nI've made a lot of progress in my professional career and something I hope that would be a good role model for my daughter when she gets older as I don't want her to grow up in a household like I did. Lately, my ex has been a lot busier since he began dating someone. He's been refusing to watch our daughter while I'm at work. The school recently called both of us to pick up our daughter due to her having an accident. I told them to call my ex-husband. They called him and he said I had to get our daughter because it was my week. Which is unlike him because he's always been willing to watch our daughter during my week if I'm working that day.\n\nThis threw me off and I ended up having to ask my parents to pick up their granddaughter. Last week, I got called in for work on a day I was supposed to have off. I brought our daughter to my ex's house while he was asleep. He usually leaves his door unlocked by habit, so I brought her inside and left for work. I also left him a text saying she's there with him.\n\nApparently his new girlfriend was there too but also asleep, probably in the guest room as I didn't see her. I got an angry call from my ex saying his girlfriend is pissed about me dropping off our daughter when they were asleep. From what I know she has no kids. She doesn't understand the work I have to do to keep a roof over mine and my daughters head. Now my ex-husband says he's going to be less available and told me to stick to our custody schedules. I'm thinking that the girlfriend is manipulating him. I can't afford a babysitter and calling off work is off the table too. The grandparents aren't always available either.

I have panic attacks every morning and  night. I can't stop thinking about all of the terrible things that could happen in life. I have crippling health anxiety and have been to the doctors so many times and had dozens of tests done. On top of that I started panicking that all the radiation i've had from xrays and CT scans has doomed me (previous post lol).

I can't even enjoy my time with him now because of how anxious I am. He is so sick, and tired and to think that his entire amazing life has come to this just makes me absolutely sick. His vocal cord was paralyzed during his biopsy in October and he can hardly talk. I've tried to find so many different doctors to help but nothing has worked yet and it's affected his quality of life so much and it KILLS me.  I have been seeing a therapist for a few months and taking Zoloft but honestly i'm not sure anything is going to help. I work on being mindful and breathing, and meditation but my anxiety wins almost every time.  I  don''t know how I will handle life without my dad, I really don't. Everyone tells me time will make things better, but things will never be the way they used to and I will never be that happy again. I feel like the best of my life is over.

I honestly thought I was just being crazy and that we'd be there for an hour or two for an NST and then be sent home.\n\nWell, we ended up being kept overnight. During the NST I had a couple Braxton Hicks and during those, my baby's heart rate dropped but they weren't sure why, because during the ultrasound she was measuring on time, had plenty of amniotic fluid, and was fidgeting the whole time. Of course while we were there they took a urine sample and found out I was pretty dehydrated, so I got a bag of fluids, and after they decided to keep us overnight I got another, bigger bag.\n\nEverything ended up ultimately being okay and they think it was a result of dehydration, which is a continued problem for me because of a stomach condition I have that makes it difficult for me to eat or drink as much as I need to be. They decided to make everything easier on me and baby to have us come in every week in my third trimester (I'm 27 weeks) for a fluid transfusion and an NST, and they're having me start kick counts a week early. Overall I'm happy with how things turned out and I'm happy I wasn't crazy and something really was going on.\n\nWhat I learned\/my thoughts during our overnight stay:\n\n- Trust your gut. If something feels wrong, call your birthing center and see what they think. They might have you come in to get checked. Better safe than sorry.\n\n- Even though my baby is twice as big as I actually thought she was, I still have a hard time feeling her move if she's positioned the right way.\n\n- Those IVs that go in your hand are a bitch! It didn't help that I was dehydrated so it was difficult for them to find a vein. It wasn't unbearable and I didn't have the urge to pull my hand away, but it did hurt and having it in overnight was uncomfortable. But if those IVs are worse than the epidural, then I'm definitely not afraid of the epidural anymore. I can do it no problem.\n\n- It's super annoying to have to move an IV stand with you when you have to use the bathroom. Especially if you also have the NST monitors strapped to you.\n\n- Those overnight rooms have mini fridges so you can bring your own cold food! Super convenient and I'm glad I now know in advance so we can plan our snacks during labor around that.\n\n- It takes damn near an eternity to get discharged from the hospital. From the time someone told us my midwife would be in to see us soon to the time she actually showed up, it was like three hours. Obviously not her fault as I'm sure there were babies to deliver and other people to tend to, but it was hard to not be irritated after having not gotten any good sleep, still being uncomfortable, and being hangry. At this point the part of birth that I'm dreading most is the wait to be discharged.\n\n- After all the jelly they used for the NST, being poked four different times, and sleeping like garbage, the hot shower when I got home was the most magical experience I've ever had. I can't wait for that first shower after birth. It's going to feel incredible!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BabyBumps","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7cl","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BabyBumps","subreddit_subscribers":306956,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My experience being kept overnight at 27 weeks","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BabyBumps\/comments\/shgzmp\/my_experience_being_kept_overnight_at_27_weeks\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

We won't go into debt but we will have to pull money from different areas that we've worked hard to put away. But i feel like our chances at IVF would be good at this point?

I can't pull hard in steep terrain on little holds cuz my fingers just won't do it. After talking with a coach I was told my fingers are behind my body in terms of strength. I'm 6'0 weigh about 170, max 7s hang is 210 on tension 20mm grindstone mk1.\nI've been trying different hb protocols for the last year or so since I hit a grade+style plateau (trouble with roofs and steep crimps). Ladders, 7\/53, max hangs, repeaters at 70%%. I've tried this all, usually for 6 weeks at a time with a couple weeks rest between trying a new protocol. Meanwhile my max strength has not gone up, perhaps actually gone down (7s max hang is around 120%). \nI can think of two possible limiting factors: 1. Chronic issue with my left upper body. Occasionally the left shoulder girdle is a limiter for my hangs. I've done a lot to improve this but it's still occasionally noticeable. I also find my right fingers are much more sore after max hangs or repeaters than my left (possibly weighting right more to compensate). 2. Linear periodization: I've been trying it out for the last 6 months or so (mid way in my second cycle now, so into the heavy hangs now). I just came out of endurance, but I kept a limit boulder day and also did the repeaters during this time.

I loved her more than I will probably ever love anyone else. We have had our issues in the past with her fidelity. Once when we were teenagers and the once when we were in our mid 20s. Fast forward to today. We are married, I am early 30s she is late 20s and she has been unfaithful again. Now, no one knows more than I do that I so stupid for taking her back. I mean, now we are married and she is out running around with some dude from another state driving my car and spending money she didn't earn. So of you may wonder why I married her, well, I didn't not ask to marry her. I didn't really plan on marrying her. She came to me and asked me to marry her. She told me that what she had done in the past were her biggest regrets of her life and that she would never hurt me like that again. So you can call it stupidity or hopefulness, but I said I would. So we have now almost been married for 2 years and it was all for nothing. I really tried my hardest for her. Especially after she became my wife. I bought us a house and her another new car. Second nee car I bought for her too, while I have never had a vehicle newer that 2008. I won't say I gave her everything she wanted, but I tried to give here everything I could. She didn't work (by preference) top of everything this last year we suffered through 2 miscarriages. It was ridiculously tough because we both really wanted children. Now with this situation, I feel like I may never get the chance to have kids because I would really like to before I am 35. It is really tough this time because she is my wife this time. I don't really know where I am going with this, I just needed to vent a bit.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BreakUps","subreddit_id":"t5_2ra79","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BreakUps","subreddit_subscribers":196188,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"An Unlucky 13","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.81,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/shh07w\/an_unlucky_13\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I am 15 years old and I have been watching you for about 6 months now and would like to say thank you for everything that you have done for me and my family. You have helped me out with many struggles such as pornography, relationships, hardship, and school just to name a few. But I have some questions about the topic of God. I am a Christian and I know that you do not necessarily like the question ‚ÄúDo you believe in God‚Äù because of how vague it is so I will present a different question. I have heard things about the bible and about God how they are fundamentally the basis of truth in at least western society and we can prove this to be so. The question I have for you is: Do you believe God is an actual being that we can talk to or is he just a figure of our imagination; a figure of truth but not actually something real. We know that the writings of the bible are so true they are the fundamental truth of civilization but does that mean that a supernatural being created them. The story of Exodus with the snakes, Jesus comparing himself to them, Cain and Abel, Moses wandering through the desert. These are all stories that I think we can both agree are literally true and fundamentally true but was there a supernatural influence or were they simply coincidental? I really hope that Jordan Peterson reads this even though he most likely won't. I know that him reading it is really unlikely and this is even less likely when he comes to Colorado on his tour if this would ever even happen. I wish I could talk to him and learn his wisdom. I wish I could be a student under him because I want to be a better person for myself and the world. He has helped me to learn to think and understand the world better. But I have so many questions that I cannot answer like the one above. They are too--too complex. I can see that the bible's stories are the ultimate truths as he has said it's ‚Äútruer than truth itself‚Äù but I cannot see if God is really physically real, not just some ghost. I have other questions that are just so hard to think about like relationships and evolution that some of the smartest people I don't think could even answer but I just wish I had someone to talk to, rebound questions off of. someone that was older and wiser than I am so I could learn and make my own thoughts.

My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in October and I have not been able to cope at all. My dad has been the closest person to me my entire life, literally my world. I am 29 and have a 3 year old daughter. Life prior to this was pretty idealistic and dare I say \"perfect\". I worked part time as a nurse and spent the last 3 years raising my daughter and it was honestly just a dream and I lived for each day. I was supposed to start a new nursing position, my daughter was starting pre- school..everything was just falling into place. I ended up turning the job down because it was just too much to take on especially because I'm my dads biggest support. I am blessed to have a supportive husband and to be able to help my dad so much but the reality is I am crumbling.  The last few months have destroyed me. I am a shell of who I was. I have panic attacks every morning and  night. I can't stop thinking about all of the terrible things that could happen in life. I have crippling health anxiety and have been to the doctors so many times and had dozens of tests done. On top of that I started panicking that all the radiation i've had from xrays and CT scans has doomed me (previous post lol).  I just can't shake the feeling of something happening to me, or my husband and picturing my daughter going through what i'm going through. The entire idea of mortality has become debilitating. I cannot fathom the idea of life without my dad. I know everyone in life goes through this, but I really just can't come to terms with anything, and i'm constantly \"mourning\" my life prior to all of this. I wish I was stronger and could handle it better. As a nurse who's been around this stuff for years I thought I'd be able to cope, but with it being my dad I just can't. I can't even enjoy my time with him now because of how anxious I am. He is so sick, and tired and to think that his entire amazing life has come to this just makes me absolutely sick. His vocal cord was paralyzed during his biopsy in October and he can hardly talk. I've tried to find so many different doctors to help but nothing has worked yet and it's affected his quality of life so much and it KILLS me.  I have been seeing a therapist for a few months and taking Zoloft but honestly i'm not sure anything is going to help. I work on being mindful and breathing, and meditation but my anxiety wins almost every time.  I  don''t know how I will handle life without my dad, I really don't. Everyone tells me time will make things better, but things will never be the way they used to and I will never be that happy again. I feel like the best of my life is over. The happiness has been ripped out of me and all I do is catastrophize all day. I haven't been able to sleep through the night in months and have tried every anxiety and sleep med that there is.  I realize I sound incredibly depressing but this is just the reality of how I feel and I just hope someone out there has some words of wisdom or advice because I feel like i'm at the end of my rope.

I'm a younger guy I'm 33.  I started doing welding and fabrication work about ten years ago.  I picked up on it rather quickly and am now a d1.1 certified welder. \n\nI started working at my current company about four years go.  I learned from the two older gentlemen who had worked there for over 20 years each, now are both retired.  In a few short years I have built all of our standard equipment, all of our R&amp;D\/prototype's and all kinds of specialty builds.\n\nThis employee started early October.  He is early 50's i would guess.  According to him  \"I have been doing this type of work longer than you have been alive, kid\".  He told me that shortly after he passed our in house weld test.  My team lead had me work with him to \"try\" and show him our processes and give any tips to help him make his work easier and more efficient.  He struggles reading our weld prints, he seems to have little common sense or critical thinking skills.  Doesn't plan his builds out ahead of time, just picks something and works on it.  So, I have tried time and time again to show him things on our prints, steps in build processes, help with weld techniques, all to no avail.  He REFUSES to listen to me because I'm just a \"kid\".\n\nA couple weeks ago he started working on a new project, a rather large project that we are on a tight deadline with as is.  Whenever we get big projects like this, the team lead and I comb over prints so we can ask engineers about anything we may be concerned with.  So, I've seen the prints and looked them over thoroughly.\n\nI bring his skids in with all the steel.  The prints for just the skid or 12 pages, I watch him look absolutely befuddled and mind blown looking at these.  Once he somewhat gathers himself he starts working.  I watch him start doing his sub assemblies, so just welding small things that are easeier to do on a table.  I see him tacking things together wrong, easy fix no big deal.  In my mind I even said \"I should tell him that's wrong\", but then I just didn't.  Then he welded it, now I should definately say something, nope.  I watch him start laying this huge project out...wrong.  For somewhat perspective the unit is 44' long, just under 12' wide, 24\" I beam and 18\" C channel.  It's big and heavy, and hard to fix once you start building.  I just sit back and keep thinking to myself, this is wrong I should tell him, but then i also say to myself he's been doing this longer than I've been alive.  And sure as shit, he welds the top, flips it over on the rotator, welds the entire bottom.  Now he is about 85 working hours into this project.  And sure as shit, he has NO idea half of it has to be cut apart and rebuilt.  The steel was all specially ordered and had to be coped and all kinds of shit, so we don't have extra.\n\nSo, now here I sit, my work all done and done right.  Just feels good, I guess.  Just because you have been doing something for along ass time, doesn't mean you have been doing it right or shouldn't ask for advice or outside opinions on shit.  I don't even feel bad about.\n\ntl:dr  New employee called me a kid, and never ask for my advice or seeks any help because he is older than me.  85+ hours of work is wrong and is going to cost the company HUGE, for late delivery and rework.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TrueOffMyChest","subreddit_id":"t5_2yuqy","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TrueOffMyChest","subreddit_subscribers":1469937,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I watched my co-worker build a multi-million dollar project wrong","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.86,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/shhab8\/i_watched_my_coworker_build_a_multimillion_dollar\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I have so many emotions leading up to this. I believe I have OCD. I've struggled with it since I was about 4 years old. I'm 27 now. To name a few of my compulsions, I have to wash my hands excessively up to my shoulder to the point where my hands are bleeding, and I have rashes on my arms (this recently lasted 23 minutes with much crying, haha.. üò∂). It takes me an hour to shower, because I have to wash myself multiple times. I don't have an exact number, but definitely 10+. I frequently check things like the door, the oven, the air conditioning, etc. And my obsessive thoughts have turned into panic attacks and severe insomnia. These are just a few. I don't want to be the person who is self-diagnosing, but just so you kind of have somewhat of an idea. \n\nI was hoping that some of you on here might be able to tell me what to expect. What is treatment like? Should I just come out and say first thing to my psychiatrist that I think I have OCD? Do you have any advice you would offer to someone in my position? This will be the first time mentioning this to another human being in my life. (side note: I have no idea how to tell my husband any of this)\n\nThis whole experience is liberating but daunting at the same time lol. \n\nI also want to thank everyone on this forum. I happened upon this forum when I was googling my symptoms and looking for relief. Reading through other people's experiences and tribulations made me feel like there are other people having similar experiences to me for the first time.

read the entire post before messaging. PM's only please. Chats will be ignored)\r  \n\r  \nYou step out of your car, your heart pounding in your ears. You had just arrived at the nudist beach, and even from here you can see dozens of nude bodies milling about on the sandy shore. You sling your bag over your shoulder and begin the walk down the wooden stairs that lead from the parking lot to the beach itself. \r  \n\r  \nAt the back of your mind, you can't help but wonder what brought you to this [moment], to try something like *this*. Perhaps it was a sense of adventure? Feeling you had gotten stuck in a rut, and wanting to shake things up a bit? Or perhaps it was simple curiosity? Having heard about nudism years ago, you wanted to see what was so great about it?\r  \n\r  \nWell, regardless of the reason, you were here now. You had found a beach that was a good couple of hours from your home, thinking that you wouldn't be seen by anyone you know. God, if anyone found out you were here...\r  \n\r  \nAfter a minute or so of walking, passing by people of all ages, ethnicities, and body types, you find a spot that you think is as good as any other. Dropping your bag onto the ground, you look around and sigh. \r  \n\r  \n*Here goes nothing...* you think, grabbing the bottom of your shirt and pulling it up over your head, revealing a simple bikini top. Truthfully, you don't know *why* you wore a bikini beneath your clothes. Maybe force of habit, maybe for an extra layer of security. Regardless of the reason, you push your shorts down, revealing matching bottoms. \r  \n\r  \nThen, you brace yourself. The moment of truth. Reaching behind your back, you untie your top and pull it off, exposing your boobs to all of the other beach goers nearby. Not wanting to chicken out, your grab your bottoms and push them down quickly and stepping out of them. \r  \n\r  \nYou close your eyes and tense up, waiting for people to start making a big fuss that you're now naked. However, when you open your eyes, you see that no one has taken notice of your nudity. If anything, you now blend in even more than you did a minute ago. \r  \n\r  \nYou release a breath you didn't realize you were holding, reaching into your bag and pulling out your towel. You spread it out and lay on top of it, feeling the sun's rays warming parts of your body that had always been covered. \r  \n\r  \nA few minutes later though, you hear someone walk up to you and speak.\r  \n\r  \n\"Uh...hi.\"\r  \n\r  \nOpening your eyes, you feel your heart drop to your stomach. Someone you recognize is at this beach. And he's standing \\*right there\\*!\r  \n\r  \n()()()()()()()()()()\r  \n\r  \nHi, everyone! My name is John. If you couldn't tell, today I'd like to do an rp centered around a woman going to a nudist beach for the first time, and coming across someone she recognizes against all odds!\r  \n\r  \nNow, who am I? Well, that's for us to decide. I could be a coworker. I could be a neighbor. I could be an ex-boyfriend. I could be a regular friend. Or something else I didn't think of.\r  \n\r  \nA little about myself: I'm 22 years old, 5'11, 175 lbs (thinner without being lanky), short blonde hair (\\~3 inches), blue eyes, glasses, no facial hair, and a 7.5 inch cock (3 inches soft).\r  \n\r  \nNow, I would like to keep this more lighthearted. We use the fact that we're both nudists to get closer to each other. I don't want this to be where I'm a creep who blackmails you into having sex with me, or I'll tell everyone you're a nudist. No, that's no fun.\r  \n\r  \nHere's a link to my [kink list](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bQoE0yr.png). I shouldn't have to say this, but please actually read it.

Not to.mention one of my favorites velma and daphne.¬†I have made a selection of prompts and ideas below but you dont have to use them their just suggestions of charecters and ideas.¬† I can play most cartoon gals just send me the ones you like in your first message. I can play classic cartoon network girls to your favorite 18 year old¬† disney channel¬† cartoon stars. \nI can also play milf¬† charecters like marge simpson,linda Belcher,or francine smith. I can also fan favorites like Marceline the vampire queen,frankie foster,catra,adora,,mable pines or wendy courdroy.¬† \nIm also open to playing charecters like lola bunny or jessica rabbit. Not to mention some dc girls like harley Quinn or Wonderwoman.\nI'm open to any ideas you have for a cartoon girl based rp. Id prefer if you play in cannon but ocs are fine. Send me some suggestions of some cartoon gals you'd like me to play in your first message.\n\nSome of my ideas for roleplays are.\n\nSimpsons-Marge could use some extra cash and is offering her services around Springfield as both a housekeeper and a Bedwarmer. That or she and an older Lisa could have a moment when she sees her mother taking a shower. That leads to the two of them having some fun together.\nI'm also open to marge filming a porn for some extra cash.Maybe she and francine smith could have some fun together.\n\nFor dc related prompts I have a few ideas.-Starfire and raven could be involved in a¬† a tamarannian heat that forces star to be breeding needing futa. Harley and ivy could be playing with pheromones that make them futas. Catwoman could try and steal bat girls virginity instead of some jewelry. Supergirl becomes wonderwomans newest toy after admiting her girlish crush on her. \n\nFor ideas like jesssica rabbit and lola I think either of them getting into porn to booster their¬† acting resumes could be fun.Getting them with some other anthro and over sexualized charecters to make some extra cash could be really fun. Maybe lola bunny and nicole.waterson for example.\n\nFor Scooby-Doo We could have the girls have a nice sleep over where the can explore each other's bodies and have a nice time solving the mystery of their first time.\n\nFor adventurtime Maybe princess bubblegum needs someone she can do some new experiments on or marceline gets closer to her bandmates.\n\nFor owl house maybe edas old job as an escort comes back to bite her when luz or her friends find an old flyer. That or we could do luz and amnitys first time.\n\nFor Steven universe. Peridot could get some experince with humans or maybe the gems play around with human anatomy.That or Priyanka makes a house call to a patient \n\n\nI'm open to any idea you wanna throw at me just send me your cartoon crush in your first message.Also send me your kinks.¬† My kik is goopghost send password Pencil with first message \n\nMy kinks are cute outfits,titjobs,anal,oral,tighjobs,hotdogging,spanking ,Milfs,age diffrence, aftercare,loving partners,lots of cum and im open to most kinks with a few hard limits includeing noncon,vore,scat and smegma","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"FurryKikPals","subreddit_id":"t5_31h59","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/FurryKikPals","subreddit_subscribers":36137,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[futa\/f4a]Who wants to fuck their cartoon crushes?[21][casual][Kik]","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FurryKikPals\/comments\/shhrkn\/futaf4awho_wants_to_fuck_their_cartoon\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I have had insomnia for at least the past 10 years, starting in college after freshman year in which I endured a severe trauma and then my dad died with another severe trauma a year after that.\n\nAnyway every night I take OTC sleeping pills and can't sleep without them. Yesterday around 5pm, I had a green tea but figured at worst, I'd be up till 3 or 4 AM but nope. I was never able to get to sleep, even after taking my OTC sleeping pills and I even took some liquid Benadryl this morning to no avail as well. I had horrible anxiety yesterday and last night so that probably didn't help.\n\nAs a result, I decided to just stay awake all day today in order to get my sleep schedule back on track. But now I'm worried that I won't be able to fall asleep tonight either. I've never been up for 2 consecutive nights - sure I've had consecutive nights of getting 2-4 hours sleep, but awake the whole time? Never happened. Unfortunately my anxiety has me freaking out bc I read lack of sleep causes hallucinations and gets worse and worse over time. I'm planning on taking my OTC sleeping pills tonight around 10 or so (normal time), but am seriously freaking out. \n\nHas this happened to anyone else? I'm 29 and perhaps getting more susceptible to caffeine but don't even know if that's entirely to blame since I used to be able to drink a Venti tea from Starbucks and pass out shortly after haha. Oh and before anyone asks, I even exercised yesterday too so it's not like I was just sitting down all day... yet I still couldn't fall asleep.\n\nThis has happened one other time, but at a much more stressful time in my life, and doctors took pity on me and gave me a short supply of mild Benzos just so I could pass out. I don't want that to become a habit though and certainly am not in the mindset to go see a doctor just so I can fall asleep. Nonetheless I just really don't want to be up all night again :\/\n\nAny and all help is appreciated, thanks for existing guys - corny as it sounds, this sub already makes me feel like there are others who understand.

I never realized how many scars I had until I met the love of my life, B. She was everything my ex wasn't, we had great chemistry, we loved spending time with each other, we were in love. We dated for Neary a year and a half before moving in. She has a kid from someone else and so did I. They got along for the most part and life had its bumps but we were happy. I live in the south and hurricane ida hit, the stresses of that, losing our home and several other events led me to have emotional out bursts directed at her child. Because she was high needs, adhd and I didn't know how to parent her. I lost my patience and yelled at her several times. I even spanked her in public, I feel like a monster. When we were displaced during the hurricane one of these incidents occurred and I said I can't do this and walked out the hotel. Both B and her child were scared because they thought I was stranding them there. I was just walking away to decompress bit I didn't verbalize that at all. It was like quicksand one event led to another, that led to another. B found a really good friend at work, another male and he supported her when I couldn't and is helping her professionally. Here comes the scars, I immediately became jealous and suspicious and made belittling comments about infidelity. None of which are true, B was nothing but loving and loyal to me. Sinking further and further into this abyss. We started therapy recently, and I thought we were if not doing better stopped sinking for a bit. An incident occurred when she was gone for work and i was with friends at a bar, I got nearly black out drunk and a man (I'm bi) followed me to the bathroom and started doing inappropriate things to me. I allowed it until I sobered up enough then pushed him off and left. I was so scared because I felt I had cheated on B and I didn't say anything for a week. In which time she was on another work trip and I made yet another infidelity comment because \"he\" was on the trip too. When she came back, that night I woke he up right after she fell asleep and told her I cheated on her. She broke up with me, she says it's because of the whole story not just the ending and I believe her. My therapist used the work assault when I relayed the story to her. I still feel responsible and guilty. \n\n\n\nDepression\n\nI was with my ex 16 years. \n\nB was so different, I've never loved anyone, more than I have loved her, I have never hurt so much from all this than I do right now. Even after a 16 year relationship with the other one I didn't hurt this much. I am empty inside, yet being gnawed alive by anxiety and guilt. I have thoughts of hurting myself daily, and I feel like I have no one to talk to. I feel guilty talking to B and hurting her more, I want to be with her but I have to respect her wants. I chose my therapist based in the fact that she was going to help me with my emotional control and she works with children like B's child and was going to help me with my patience and understanding on how to parent a child like hers. I love B and her child so much and i want nothing more than to be a good example for both our kids, I'm so scared. So so scared. I'm losing a part of my family, a part of me. My best friend in the whole world, someone I've grown to rely on for comfort, love, opinions, she has made me a better person and want to be even better .  I have no pleasure in anything, I have to want to get out of bed, to eat, I just cry all day. Even at work, I steal off to break down somewhere. I just want to make everything right, I just want to fix the hurt that I caused. I want everyone to be happy. I want to be back in my home with my family. Doing what i loved which was listening to music while B and I cooked together. I just want so much but that's also a problem, I want and want and B have and gave and she feels she has nothing to give. I feel and know the outcome, she will leave me for good under the pretense of us still being friends. I will let her go because I have no choice and I want her to be happy. I want her in my life so I will be friends as much as I can, and just take the hurt. Because I love her and I can't not have her in my life. \n\nThis is long and rambling, I am sorry.
