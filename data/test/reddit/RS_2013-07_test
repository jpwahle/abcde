I turn on PBS for sister and I head back downstairs...followed by my girlfriends sister. So we just sit there on the couch trying to watch Johnny Bravo on Netflix while her sister stares at us. It was about 4 hours of just being pissed off and feeling like I was fucking everything up. I just want to see her and talk to her. Her eleven year old sister is not my responsibility. I'm sick of trying to entertain her, paying for her meals, and constantly being stared at. I'm tired of her spoiled and rude attitude.

I apologize for all the text in advance. I'm here hoping I might be able to ask a bit of career/directional advice from those of you who have already walked the path I am considering walking. I'm 27 years old, BA in History, Minor in Poly Sci. Between 3 years work as an Executive Assistant, 3 years as a non-profit Administrative Manager, and my current part time gig consulting with a small international development startup (my full time job is currently working as a Police Officer), I am closing in rapidly on 7 years of experience in the business world. \n  I don't intend on being an Officer for the rest of my days (good pay, but the long hours are a tremendous burden), and I would like to get back into the business world full time. That being said, my department offers nearly 100% tuition coverage if I decided to pursue a Masters degree and/or Masters level certification. I am considering using these benefits towards the completion of an online MBA program and a Graduate Certification In HR and Organization Development from a school ranked around 40th, which will hopefully aid in the pursuit of a better, more fulfilling job in the business field. \n  Currently, my salary averages out to be around the 75k mark, and I am hoping to find myself in a position in project management, operations, administration/management, or HR that brings in at least a 15% better than this number, while providing me with the challenge, stability and fulfillment I seek from a job in the business world.

I apologize for all the text in advance. I&amp;#39;m here hoping I might be able to ask a bit of career/directional advice from those of you who have already walked the path I am considering walking. I&amp;#39;m 27 years old, BA in History, Minor in Poly Sci. Between 3 years work as an Executive Assistant, 3 years as a non-profit Administrative Manager, and my current part time gig consulting with a small international development startup (my full time job is currently working as a Police Officer), I am closing in rapidly on 7 years of experience in the business world. \n  I don&amp;#39;t intend on being an Officer for the rest of my days (good pay, but the long hours are a tremendous burden), and I would like to get back into the business world full time. That being said, my department offers nearly 100% tuition coverage if I decided to pursue a Masters degree and/or Masters level certification. I am considering using these benefits towards the completion of an online MBA program and a Graduate Certification In HR and Organization Development from a school ranked around 40th, which will hopefully aid in the pursuit of a better, more fulfilling job in the business field. \n  Currently, my salary averages out to be around the 75k mark, and I am hoping to find myself in a position in project management, operations, administration/management, or HR that brings in at least a 15% better than this number, while providing me with the challenge, stability and fulfillment I seek from a job in the business world.

GF is ~120, TF is ~80 (she's about 4 feet 8 inches.) The people put us with 5 other girls, one of them I'll call Moochy. Moochy was about 5 feet, but weighed around 160. Note-we're all 12-15. As soon as we joined the group, Moochy asks us, \"Do you guys have any food to spare?\" I sigh and look at the clock. We've been here for 10 minutes, and we'll be at the bowling alley (rainy day) in around 15 minutes. We all shake our heads and inch away. \"But pleeeeaaaassseee, redracheld?\" She begs. I say no and walk away. Fast forward to the bowling alley. I buy medium thing of cheetus fries for the 3 of us to share. Moochy begs and begs for some food, but we refuse. She gets really mad and sits down, her stomach jiggling ominously. We get up to go fix our hair, and we come back to see our container of fries literally licked clean. We look at Moochy and she's licking her fingers clean. We get angry because I spent a good $5 on that. She then f-ing asked for more food. We ignore her. Fast forward to the movies. I buy a candy package for my friends, and only my friends. After the cashier hands it to me, she rips it out of my hand and eats it all, GF and TF trying to stop her. We then tell the person in charge, but he says to let it go, even though she's taken at least $10 in 3 hours. I asked her why she did that, and she replied, \"You didn't buy me enough food.\" Note- I don't even know her.\nThis is going to be a long month of camp.","link_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"ups":139,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1hgjyg/fatty_at_camp/","score":139,"thumbnail":"self","over_18":false}

We're both into the BDSM scene already, with profiles on Fetlife, and I've suggested that we both have a profile section that mentions it. But Fetlife isn't really a dating/hookup site, more of a kinky Facebook. Swingers' websites seem like the other obvious option, but it's a question of which to use. What I've seen looked fairly US-centric, and we're in the UK. Also, I get the impression that the swinging community trends much older. I'm 23, she's 21, and we'd rather get involved with people closer to our own age.\n\nSecond, after discussing what we're looking for, it seems like we'd both rather play with a couple, as a couple. Failing that, we're both bi, so bisexual men and women are both options. But how do I distinguish between those who genuinely want to play with a couple and those who are willing to accept the inconvenience of another man to get to the woman? Given the profiles I saw on sites I looked at that stated that they're looking for either a single woman or a couple, that seems worryingly plausible.

What I&amp;#39;ve seen looked fairly US-centric, and we&amp;#39;re in the UK. Also, I get the impression that the swinging community trends much older. I&amp;#39;m 23, she&amp;#39;s 21, and we&amp;#39;d rather get involved with people closer to our own age.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, after discussing what we&amp;#39;re looking for, it seems like we&amp;#39;d both rather play with a couple, as a couple. Failing that, we&amp;#39;re both bi, so bisexual men and women are both options. But how do I distinguish between those who genuinely want to play with a couple and those who are willing to accept the inconvenience of another man to get to the woman? Given the profiles I saw on sites I looked at that stated that they&amp;#39;re looking for either a single woman or a couple, that seems worryingly plausible. I ended our first nonmono experience because I felt like I was getting frozen out. What sort of tells should we look for to screen for that? What questions should we ask?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;"}

Normally, just certain shows or maybe a &amp;#39;vacation&amp;#39; to the east coast where I&amp;#39;d see my family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of that was garbage.

I was playing a show and thought &amp;quot;hell, I&amp;#39;ll drink tonight, I&amp;#39;ve got drink tickets.&amp;quot; Then I was partying, drinking and behaving poorly for another 6 weeks. (All of this, mind you, with the knowledge that I had follow-up work to do on my unhealthy liver, as well concerns that I had lower-intestinal problems what with blood in stools. You know. &amp;quot;Fun things&amp;quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One drink became several hundred, which brought me right up to New Years Day, the last day I drank anything alcoholic.

THAT'S 6 DANG MONTHS!\"\n\nThis same time last year I had already learned from my doctor that my liver was ailing and that if I had kept up with my regiment of 'heroic vodka consumption' I would die very shortly and very much not a hero.\n\nRather than take his advice all the way home, I let the old 'rationale-control-o-meter' take over. My then girlfriend was helpful to the nth degree with her support, but as these things go, I wasn't near enough ready and didn't have the tools to actually make a positive change.\n\nSo I would limit my drinking, relegating it here and there for certain things. Normally, just certain shows or maybe a 'vacation' to the east coast where I'd see my family.\n\nAll of that was garbage. After I failed in my relationship I let drink consume me again, but it started off so innocently. I was playing a show and thought \"hell, I'll drink tonight, I've got drink tickets.\" Then I was partying, drinking and behaving poorly for another 6 weeks. (All of this, mind you, with the knowledge that I had follow-up work to do on my unhealthy liver, as well concerns that I had lower-intestinal problems what with blood in stools. You know. \"Fun things\".)\n\nOne drink became several hundred, which brought me right up to New Years Day, the last day I drank anything alcoholic. It was then that I realized that this delusion of control was simply that, a delusion, and that if I wanted to actually LIVE and have a LIFE worth living, that it was time to put it down and walk away.\n\nHere I am 6 months later! Health is much improved, liver on the mend, everything else in my world is creeping in it's improvement, but from what I hear that's about the pace to expect.\n\nI've zero intention of drinking again. It feels great to say because I know that it's the best thing I've ever done for myself. \n\nAnd believe me, if I can quit booze and feel good about it, ANYBODY can. \n\nThanks for your time and continued, unfettered support.

The one he was looking for had rolled into the corner and I hadn&amp;#39;t seen it.  He screamed, &amp;quot;Deaf and blind! You&amp;#39;re fucking handicap! Where did your parents find you, in a fucking orphanage?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left the basement and started crying.  It was by far the cruelest thing he had ever said to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His temper is totally unpredictable.  Something that was completely fine yesterday will set him off the next.  He has never hit me but I have to admit I have started to fear that he will.  When I help him and he starts screaming I just picture him walking over to me and backhanding my face.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How does one deal with such a temper?  Is this something that can be fixed.  He refused counselling once before.  Is this marriage dead?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL:DR My husband&amp;#39;s temper is out of control.

{"subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","id":"1hgb92","selftext":"Im a 17 year old girl, and I've been hiding this for a very long time (about a year). I haven't told a single soul in real life.\n\nIt started with going on omegle to talk to people. Just normal conversations. I ignored any horny people. Then, whenever I talked to guys, sometimes flirting would happen. I never showed guys what I looked like. One day, I talked to this other guy, and we had, cybersex (I don't know a better word for this), no pics or anything. I didn't masturbate as I was talking to him, I was just turned on as we told each other what we wanted to do. After, I felt incredibly ashamed, and hot at the same time. For days, it stayed at the back of my mind. At school, I would think that all these people around me don't know that I'm a slut.\n\nAfter that, I held off of omegle for a while. But last fall, I started again. I got a kik and talked to guys I met on the site. Then, we'd trade pics. At first, I wouldn't give them a pic of my face, but then before we talked they would ask what I looked like. Then, I started out with tame pics, waist up, little clothing. But as time went on I would show everything. Mind you, my face was never in any of these pics (except for one when I started out, but I am pretty sure that guy wouldn't have used it against me since he's my age). \n\nI rarely talked to a guy more than once. We would trade, then I'd stop talking to them. I picked up many guys and did sort of a one time thing. I'm embarrassed at the number of guys I have in my kik contact list.\n\nAround Christmas last year, things got intense. The TL;DR version is I met a guy from england on omegle who did nothing but game and masturbate, and was bipolar. He also said that he'd slept with a bunch of girls. His life sucks, to him. He was clingy, and I couldn't handle that. He was horny all the time and always asked for pics and videos. I obliged. He took up all my time, and made me feel guilty when I had to leave him to do something else. I decided that I didn't want to invest myself in a taxing relationship, so I tried to cut it off. He had an episode, and threatened to put my vids on motherless and the like. He bluffed by saying he already uploaded them. One of the vids had a quick moment where you could see some of my face, and this worried me. I tried to get the truth out of him, but he kept changing his story. I ended up blocking him on Skype after he taunted me saying \"just block me already\". This all happened in 3 days. It was really stupid of me, but I'm glad I didn't let it go on longer. I suspect that he is sociopath, or that he has some things deeply wrong with him.\n\nAlso during Christmas break, I talked to another guy. I usually ended up trading with white guys. But I put black in the omegle interests to see if I would have a better chance (I had about a 75% success rate normally. I'm black so some people obviously don't like that) anyway, this guy started out saying he was looking for a submissive girl, and I didn't think of it as BDSM. I kept on talking to him. He said he was black. I played hard to get, but we eventually got on Skype. \n\nIt started with me doing the usual stripping, but then he started asking for me to call myself names, roughly play with my boobs, call him master, etc. I'm used to trading instead of one way sharing. So I asked him if I could see him, he put it off by saying in a second. I asked again later, and he asked if I would be upset if he said I was white. This didn't upset me, I don't mind white guys at all, I even have a slight preference, but why would he hide this from me? He did ask if i would mind calling myself a slave, or the n-word. this took me aback and i refused. it now occurs to me that he probably lied about his race so he could somehow justify his use of the n-word. Personally, it didn't bother me as much as it should have because it was all play rather than malice.  So he showed and things were okay. \n\nWe skyped 2 more times after that. The 2nd time was everything, since I only did waist up the first time. His BDSM fetish came out during that session. I called him white master, I slapped myself, gagged myself, even lightly choked myself once. I had to ask for his permission for certain things, and thank him when he let me. After that, I didn't talk to him for like 4 months because I decided that I didn't want to do anything sexual with anyone I met online anymore. \n\nBut one day I logged into Skype and we talked. Then, we had another session. I was home alone, so he insisted that I talk our loud rather than type. I did the same type of stuff, plus a few new things that surprised me. I asked to see him, and he said when he felt I had earned it. Eventually, he showed himself. Things went on, but whenever I gagged myself, he wanted to see more of my face. I refused, he had only seen the bottom half of my face. He accidentally saw a little of my face and said I was cute. I eventually decided to our my face in the screen, making him promise not to show this to anyone. We continued, with added things like him saying I was so cute and to call myself a pretty slave. It ended after he came and I finished off. \n\nLike a month later, we just talked. I said I wasn't sure about camming, and he said he was fine with that. I told him about my problems (depression, loneliness) and he eagerly said he'd still want to talk to me and help me with them. I was suprised he cared at all. After that conversation, I never talked to him again. I felt that what I was doing wasn't healthy with my state of mind. I have not talked to him since that day.\n\nNow, I try not to go on omegle and trade pics, but it still happens occasionally when I'm really horny. I was staying at a hotel a few days ago and I had the urge, so I went on and found a new guy and traded.\n\nIn real life, boys don't talk to me. Boys don't like me. I haven't been kissed or done anything sexual with a boy. Sometimes I have crushes, but they end up with me thinking about him all the time without saying anything to him. And sometimes I can't tell if a guy is being friendly or if he likes me. From what I can tell, not a single boy has had a crush on me during my three years of high school. \n\nMy only doubt is freshman year, this really tall (which appeals to me since I'm 5'9), tan guy kept on staring at me in English class. We always made eye contact in the halls. One day, I was walking in an empty hall, and he was there. He said hey to me. Now, this was a VERY big deal. This happened one more time after school. But he started hanging around other girls, and eventually made out with one in the band room. This discouraged me and I promptly forgot about him. These days, he is on and off with a girl. \n\nWhen I take action, nothing happens. I gave a guy my number at a retreat where we all bonded. I slipped a note into his mailbox. He hasn't said anything to me, other than exchange a few words during class.\n\nMy pathetic life was the cause of my sexcapades. No close friends, no boys, pressure from parents about school, my shortcomings; these all make my life worse. \n\nI just needed to tell somebody.","link_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"score":3,"ups":3,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hgb92/i_sext_and_can_with_guys_i_met_online_because/","over_18":false,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"downs":0,"user_reports":[],"author":"Throwaway_basura","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im a 17 year old girl, and I&amp;#39;ve been hiding this for a very long time (about a year).

{"edited":false,"link_flair_text":null,"selftext":"Hi reddit, so I'm 16 and am looking for a girlfriend so here's a little background info on me and my situation. I live in the UK and have just finished grammar school (posh high school - not posh though, I promise :P) I have asked this girl out before and she said \"no\" alright I get it, move on but I can't seem to move on. I am depressed with massive anxiety issues (asking her out was one of the bravest things i've ever done) and take medication for this as well as seeing psychiatrists every couple of weeks. Because of the anxiety issues I missed 7 months of school in the last year and 3 months the year before. Also I have the courage to post this as it is anonymous on a dummy account. \n\n We have had very limited conversations via Facebook and she has always made me feel better. She isn't typical and is really kind and comforting and the people she associates herself with are too. I do not feel as if my work is done and I want to ask her out again before the prom in a few days so I kinda wrote a love letter which is further down, My question to you, reddit, is;\n\nShould i send the letter via Facebook (sad and pathetic I know) or print it and have her/me read it at the prom privately of course but i'd have to muster up the courage to do that so i'll most likely will just send it via facebook unless reddit has other suggestions :) Also are 'love letters' even cool and romantic or just plain creepy (limited social interaction - I dunno these things) Am I overly attached to her? Am I just crazy? Or am I the boy every girl dreams of (I hope it's that one haha) Anyways here's the letter:\n\n\"I will be unrelentingly honest here, every word has been carefully selected to best reflect how I truly feel and articulated in such a way that leaves me  hoping you understand this message to its fullest effect. Please take the time to read this message carefully and absorb it all. I trust you to keep this private. Also I hope you don't find the fact I am confiding in you despite limited conversations creepy, I mean it to be 'romantic' for lack of a better word. It is a long message so I might split it into 2 or 3 sections. If I do that just message back your thoughts when you have read the entirety\n\nI am in a bottomless pit of clinical depression, I have no hope, no ambition and no aspiration. My moods swing and I can't take it anymore. Seemingly every situation causes intolerable anxiety and I feel worthless because of it. I am anxious about so many things my head feels like a pressure container waiting to explode. I've told you about some of my symptoms of anxiety, but to be sympathetic you must have felt them yourself. \n\nMy chest feels tight, my ribcage feels like it wants to collapse, My heart rate is absurd, I can literally FEEL the adrenaline being released, I shake, I become aggressive towards my closest of friends and family. I've gone through phases of different unusual symptoms. I can't sleep at night I'm constantly tired and restless at the same time. There is a constant sense of dread.  I feel drowsy, my muscles ache from stress and tension. I lose my appetite and feel physically sick and have been recently.  I HATE it all. \n\nYou are probably thinking I need help, medication, therapy etc. I wish it worked to the extent I want it to. Talking to people helps but only for a short period of time. The medicine has only made the high moods higher and the low moods increasingly worse. I still refuse to commit suicide but the thoughts are creeping into my head and it increasingly becomes more appealing. Don't worry however, I'm too much of a worthless coward to do it.\n\nPart 2/2\n\n I want YOU to help me feel less worthless and anxious so I can be 'me'.  I want a special someone I can call 'mine' that I can confide in and love. I genuinely feel I am missing someone like that. For some reason I have chosen you. My mind has made me think you're beautiful, kind, trustworthy, caring, intelligent enough to understand/appreciate this heart filled message and you're Russian which is a bonus ;) Our limited conversations have only reinforced my thoughts. As far as I know you have not told anyone about my depression which again reinforces my thoughts. \n\nSo here I am asking you out… again hopefully this time I do it justice on just how much it truly means to me. May seem foolish for a 16 year old to be this certain after all what experiences do I have? But I have never been this certain. I am asking for merely ONE chance. Although I have made pretty much everything about me I'm not like that usually I just wanted to get things off of my chest. I doubt you are physically attracted so I am appealing to your emotions and hell if a relationship works properly you should start to find me attractive but thats a long shot :P  In my eyes you are amazing, maybe I'm delusional but I can guarantee few others will ever feel how I do right now.\n\n I know you said you are not ready for a relationship but I am very reserved usually, not too clingy, but very committed/loyal to things and people I care for. I get you have said 'no' before but the last message was more of a general \"up for a relationship\" instead of a \"This is how i truly feel\"  Before I mentioned you are free to tell anyone if you say yes. I am going to retract that, my confidence charade was pathetic and a lie. I'd honestly rather keep judging eyes out of this if anything comes about. \n\nThis may just be the thing that gets me recovering again or catapults me into a spiralling pit of sadness, loneliness and insanity.  I do not think words do it justice of how much something like this means to someone like me in my condition, you said it yourself you have nothing to contrast it with. I'm sorry for the long message but I have worked this up to mean so much to me because that's how the brain works I guess.  I promise you I am not guilt tripping you into saying yes, I could never forgive myself if that were the case, I just wanted to open up on how I truly feel and hopefully it convinces you enough into changing your mind. I'm not sure what I'll do if the answer is 'no' again but do not feel as if you are responsible for any repercussions I have.\"\n\nTL;DR - I'm 16 M UK, want a girlfriend previously rejected by same girl, wrote love letter, massive anxiety issues, are love letters at 16 romantic/charming or just creepy (She's an intelligent girl hence grammar school) and should I send it via facebook or read it to her at the prom after party or send it to her after if I can't muster up the courage to do it face to face.\n\nDoing this on a whim whilst i have courage for any extra details just ask :)\n\n\n","id":"1hgaki","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0cn","thumbnail":"default","over_18":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hgaki/16m_need_help_winning_a_girls_heart/","ups":1,"score":1,"downs":0,"author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi reddit, so I&amp;#39;m 16 and am looking for a girlfriend so here&amp;#39;s a little background info on me and my situation.

After the 20-25 minutes I had to stop her I couldn't take it anymore it felt like an enjoyable torture. I didnt want it to stop but my legs were shaking I couldnt even stand for a while.

I haven't told a single soul in real life.\n\nIt started with going on omegle to talk to people. Just normal conversations. I ignored any horny people. Then, whenever I talked to guys, sometimes flirting would happen. I never showed guys what I looked like. One day, I talked to this other guy, and we had, cybersex (I don't know a better word for this), no pics or anything. I didn't masturbate as I was talking to him, I was just turned on as we told each other what we wanted to do. After, I felt incredibly ashamed, and hot at the same time. For days, it stayed at the back of my mind. At school, I would think that all these people around me don't know that I'm a slut.\n\nAfter that, I held off of omegle for a while. But last fall, I started again. I got a kik and talked to guys I met on the site. Then, we'd trade pics. At first, I wouldn't give them a pic of my face, but then before we talked they would ask what I looked like. Then, I started out with tame pics, waist up, little clothing. But as time went on I would show everything. Mind you, my face was never in any of these pics (except for one when I started out, but I am pretty sure that guy wouldn't have used it against me since he's my age). \n\nI rarely talked to a guy more than once. We would trade, then I'd stop talking to them. I picked up many guys and did sort of a one time thing. I'm embarrassed at the number of guys I have in my kik contact list.\n\nAround Christmas last year, things got intense. The TL;DR version is I met a guy from england on omegle who did nothing but game and masturbate, and was bipolar. He also said that he'd slept with a bunch of girls. His life sucks, to him. He was clingy, and I couldn't handle that. He was horny all the time and always asked for pics and videos. I obliged. He took up all my time, and made me feel guilty when I had to leave him to do something else. I decided that I didn't want to invest myself in a taxing relationship, so I tried to cut it off. He had an episode, and threatened to put my vids on motherless and the like. He bluffed by saying he already uploaded them. One of the vids had a quick moment where you could see some of my face, and this worried me. I tried to get the truth out of him, but he kept changing his story. I ended up blocking him on Skype after he taunted me saying \"just block me already\". This all happened in 3 days. It was really stupid of me, but I'm glad I didn't let it go on longer. I suspect that he is sociopath, or that he has some things deeply wrong with him.\n\nAlso during Christmas break, I talked to another guy. I usually ended up trading with white guys. But I put black in the omegle interests to see if I would have a better chance (I had about a 75% success rate normally. I'm black so some people obviously don't like that) anyway, this guy started out saying he was looking for a submissive girl, and I didn't think of it as BDSM. I kept on talking to him. He said he was black. I played hard to get, but we eventually got on Skype. \n\nIt started with me doing the usual stripping, but then he started asking for me to call myself names, roughly play with my boobs, call him master, etc. I'm used to trading instead of one way sharing. So I asked him if I could see him, he put it off by saying in a second. I asked again later, and he asked if I would be upset if he said I was white. This didn't upset me, I don't mind white guys at all, I even have a slight preference, but why would he hide this from me? He did ask if i would mind calling myself a slave, or the n-word. this took me aback and i refused. it now occurs to me that he probably lied about his race so he could somehow justify his use of the n-word. Personally, it didn't bother me as much as it should have because it was all play rather than malice.  So he showed and things were okay. \n\nWe skyped 2 more times after that. The 2nd time was everything, since I only did waist up the first time. His BDSM fetish came out during that session. I called him white master, I slapped myself, gagged myself, even lightly choked myself once. I had to ask for his permission for certain things, and thank him when he let me. After that, I didn't talk to him for like 4 months because I decided that I didn't want to do anything sexual with anyone I met online anymore. \n\nBut one day I logged into Skype and we talked. Then, we had another session. I was home alone, so he insisted that I talk our loud rather than type. I did the same type of stuff, plus a few new things that surprised me. I asked to see him, and he said when he felt I had earned it. Eventually, he showed himself. Things went on, but whenever I gagged myself, he wanted to see more of my face. I refused, he had only seen the bottom half of my face. He accidentally saw a little of my face and said I was cute. I eventually decided to our my face in the screen, making him promise not to show this to anyone. We continued, with added things like him saying I was so cute and to call myself a pretty slave. It ended after he came and I finished off. \n\nLike a month later, we just talked. I said I wasn't sure about camming, and he said he was fine with that. I told him about my problems (depression, loneliness) and he eagerly said he'd still want to talk to me and help me with them. I was suprised he cared at all. After that conversation, I never talked to him again. I felt that what I was doing wasn't healthy with my state of mind. I have not talked to him since that day.\n\nNow, I try not to go on omegle and trade pics, but it still happens occasionally when I'm really horny. I was staying at a hotel a few days ago and I had the urge, so I went on and found a new guy and traded.\n\nIn real life, boys don't talk to me. Boys don't like me. I haven't been kissed or done anything sexual with a boy. Sometimes I have crushes, but they end up with me thinking about him all the time without saying anything to him. And sometimes I can't tell if a guy is being friendly or if he likes me. From what I can tell, not a single boy has had a crush on me during my three years of high school. \n\nMy only doubt is freshman year, this really tall (which appeals to me since I'm 5'9), tan guy kept on staring at me in English class. We always made eye contact in the halls. One day, I was walking in an empty hall, and he was there. He said hey to me. Now, this was a VERY big deal. This happened one more time after school. But he started hanging around other girls, and eventually made out with one in the band room. This discouraged me and I promptly forgot about him. These days, he is on and off with a girl. \n\nWhen I take action, nothing happens. I gave a guy my number at a retreat where we all bonded. I slipped a note into his mailbox. He hasn't said anything to me, other than exchange a few words during class.\n\nMy pathetic life was the cause of my sexcapades.

We've known each other for almost 10 years. We grew up with the same friends and I've always liked her. We dated when I was 13 and she was 14, and we was pretty serious for over a year. We even had sex several times which was the first time for both us. \n\nNow, our relationship was extremely weird. We (was probably because of me and my weird, awkward behavior) never talked about feelings, we never hung out in public, we were always alone in her room spending time together, usually watching a movie or making out. We were fine talking about feelings, sex, and basically everything we didn't talk about IRL, using MSN and SMS. It's really weird when you think about it, I always told her that I loved her when I texted her etc. but when we were together I felt too awkward (scared maybe?) to actually say it out loud. \n\nAfter a year or so, I broke it off with her for no particular reason because I was (am?) stupid, and I have no idea why I actually did it. She moved out of town 3 years later, and we hadn't spoken to each other for over 7 years until she moved back earlier this year. \n\nWe met at a party, talked a bit but nothing more. Finds out she's a lesbian now and has been one for 3 years or so. Started texting her a bit, and we've seen each other a few times over the last couple of months but always in the company of other friends, at parties and get-togethers and what not. It's weird, now that I've matured I feel less awkward talking about these things that I wouldn't dare talking about when were together. I feel we have a good time together when we talk but I do not think she's interested. For instance, she insisted on bringing another friend on a walk the other day, like it was too awkward being alone with me?\n\nNow, I can't get this girl out of my head, even though she's a lesbian and doesn't seem interested in me (I realize we've only spoken briefly and these things take time). She's always very nice and giggily when I'm talking to her but I guess that's her normal behavior. I want to be friends with her and move forward. I don't want to think about her constantly and in a way that's only hurting me. She may move out of town again in a few months, but I feel like that will only make things worse for me. I will miss her and it will only hurt me more.\n\nWhen I see her talking to other friends, she behaves and reacts differently than when she's talking to me, probably because I'm awkward or because of our past? I don't know if it's positive or negative either. It's a bit like when we were together all those years ago, but I think I'm much less awkward now, even if it's still there.

I didn't think scary stories were true. I don't think this is \"normal\". I mean sure kids change when they grow at that age. But this? No. Not like this.\n\nI'm getting ahead of myself. Hello reddit. My name is Casey. I'm 23. I'm a preschool teacher. I recently had to move from everything I knew because I had a crazy fiance who hated my job. And my friends. And my family. He hated when I left the house, or when I did anything without him. Eventually it got to the point where he would call into work for me to say that I wasn't coming in because he didn't want me to leave the house. Crazy.\n\nSo I move 3 states over, blocked him from ever finding me on facebook and changed my number without telling my family and friends. I literally left with a bag full of clothes and a credit card that I managed to hide from his knowledge. I got a new job as a preschool teacher in a new state. I had previously been a preschool teacher for 3 years so obtaining the job was fairly easy. \n\nI started about two months ago. Just long enough to get to know all the kids I taught, find a cheap apartment, and start a new life in a city that I didn't know. \n\nAt first I really liked the school. A little dreary, but it's an older facility. The staff was really nice! And the parents were almost always polite. If course there would be those few that didn't stop just to chat. But what can I say, for the most part I felt really good about everything. I had started to stop looking over my shoulder at the smallest things. Still locked my doors and windows when I went to bed of course, but I wasn't afraid to go buy some groceries. \n\nThe owner of the facility had her niece come in and start training because the owner was going to be leaving in a month to go on vacation. But a week after her niece, Jesabelle, Jezzy for short, had started, the owner left without a word. Jezzy said that she had left early. I thought it was kinda weird. That was last week. Thursday. \n\nAnyway. Once of my little girls started acting strange. Growling at us. Glaring and hissing at us. I found her eating a lizard. Sure, kids put things they shouldn't in their mouths. But literally biting the head off a lizard? No. When I tried to take it from her and clean her up, she bit me. Big no no. I called Jezzy out to ask her to call her mom because I was going to have to file an incident report about both the lizard and my bite. \n\nJezzy was a little short with me before the owner, Mary, had left. But this time she snapped at me for allowing myself to get bit. It wasn't normal for that little girl to bite, so I had no issue holding my hand under her mouth while telling her to spit the head out. That's when she bit me. It didn't break skin, but it did leave a welt. \n\nI ended up having to call the little girls mother at work to explain what happened. She started screaming at me! How did she get a lizard? What was I doing to provoke her? Things like that. After so long in a preschool environment, you tend to get used to parents snapping at you instead of accepting that it wasn't your fault.\n\nAfter lunch, a few more of the kids started the growling and hissing. I figured it was \"monkey see, monkey do\". We would just have to stay something to the parents about not encouraging animal sounds  like that. So I wrote myself a note that during naptime I needed to make notes home to those families.\n\nWe let the kids play with play-doh while we set up for naptime. Some of our kids fight us at naptime but usually they crash pretty quick. The girl who bit me is one of the ones that is asleep as soon as we turn the lights out. \n\nToday she refused to go to bed. Something is up. I check her  temperature. It was 97.5. Huh. A little below, but we'll call her mom yet again. I call down to Jezzy and ask her to let mom know that the girl is having some pretty strange behavior today. She glared at me. I figured she was stressed and that she would call the mother. \n\nDuring naptime, the kids have to stay on their beds with their shoes on. The little girl growled and hissed at me and even threw her shoes off at me. The others who had started to growl after lunch kept waking up to laugh and growl with the little girl. \n\nI waited until naptime was over before allowing them to get off their beds. The ones who had started growling and hissing were playing together in a corner with the dolls. Great! They had stopped hissing at me for the time. After about 20 minutes they got up and ran by the arts and crafts center to color. I went over to the dolls to ask them to come back and clean up their mess but they had destroyed the dolls! Ripped the arms, heads, and legs off. \n\nI wrote another note to the families explaining that the violent behavior was not acceptable. They needed to help explain that it's not okay to hurt the dolls or to growl at the teachers. When I finished putting the notes in the kids' cubbies I did a quick count. I was one short. I counted again. Still one short. I asked my co teacher how many we had. 17. I only counted 16.\n\nI freak out. How can a child (who would have an extremely hard time opening any door) suddenly go missing?! I hear a giggle. It came from the teacher closet (where we keep art supplies, our purses, jackets, snacks etc.) I run and found the door open. There is our 17th kid. Of course. The same little girl who had been causing mayhem all day. I get down on her level and tell her that she scared me. She can't run and hide like that!  She spit in my face. I called Jezzy and asked her to take her to the front and call home and that mom and I need to have a sit down when she gets picked up. \n\nJezzy didn't even glare. She picked up the child. SHE STARTED PURRING!!!!!!!!!! I don't get it. The little girl went from hissing at me, to purring for Jezzy. \n\nWhen mom came and picked the girl up, signed the incident forms, she glared at me and left the room to sign her daughter out. The dad looked like he hadn't slept in a few days. He said she had been acting this way since Friday night. Growling, hissing, hiding, breaking toys, and tormenting the cat. He left with fear in his eyes.\n\nI'm not looking forward to tomorrow. My hand hurts. I need a outlet for all this crazy. I don't have many friends except the 19 yo who told me about this site when she picked up her cousin one day. That's how I got here. I was looking for advice. This seemed like the right place for this. I hope it doesn't get any worse than it has. Hopefully I won't need to do a update.","thumbnail":"self","over_18":false,"score":24,"ups":24,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hg7gh/demon_children/","downs":0,"author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know where to turn.

Really young, but off and on. I saw a few acts of violence, from kids against other kids, that really made me question things. Morality. When I was really young I decided God was either dead or had never existed in the first place, and that literally everything good and bad in this world was a matter of *someones* personal responsibility. (When I took a class on Sartre, I discovered everyone else called this existentialism, and I was startled to be so familiar with a subject I'd never researched.)\n\nEvery scar, every laugh, every smile *belongs* to someone and *is caused by* someone, even if those are the same one.\n\nI've never had a lot of friends. I went to public school in a rural area, and I basically had three friends who I could stand, who I felt comfortable around. They were mostly older, some younger, but almost none my exact age. Most of my best friendships have been with women, but more often than not I've ended up having some romantic feelings for them. The few that reciprocated are responsible for my happiest times. \n\nIn elementary school, of course, you have to be made fun of for something, and since I was cute and had nice hair, but most importantly preferred the company of the cute girls, I was obviously the gay one. Unfortunetly I wondered if the girls suspected there was truth in this, so I tried to proclaim my heterosexuality more often, which, when you're a young man, is equivalent to just making tasteless sex jokes all the time. So that wasn't really endearing to the girls, and they began to lose their affection for me. My older friends began to find me annoying, my younger friends thought I was becoming rather dark. My parents announced their divorce in the fifth grade, and I started using video games to escape reality. When it was finalized in the 7th grade, I wasn't relieved so much as tormented with all the changes I knew were to come, and I escaped even more. I escaped to the point that even my best friends would not see me for weeks, even over summer break.\n\nMy first real girlfriend I met the spring of 8th grade, and we had a sort of illicit affair (she didn't want her best friend, who was a girl I'd been very close with during school, to know)  before freshmen year, had my first kiss, my first blow job, my first love. It took maybe a week or two of reduced contact for her to decide she could do better. A month later I saw her at my neighbors, an older kid I'd had a falling out with.  They were going around the neighborhood, hanging out with other friends of mine. I cried. \n\nTwo years later. 15. Depression, anxiety, and a darth of athleticism left with me with horrendous acne and little self-esteem. Winter of junior year. Life is dark. My world is dark. I consider solipsism. I feel horrendous. I think about suicide. I don't for my mothers sake - I don't want to be responsible for her tears, her sadness, but I dont know how to get rid of my own. I get lucky when the school librarian, a very genuine guy, takes over as track coach. I think it'll be a chill way to spend more time with the few friends I have. \nI was astonished at how god damn good effort made me feel. I had been coasting through high school with ease. In class I usually knew the answer, especially if it was not really answerable. But I didn't want to be a seen as a kiss-ass, so I didn't raise my hand much. I didn't want to be seen as an egghead so I didn't take all honors courses. I didn't want to reach out to anyone, even though I wanted more friends, because I wanted to seem cool.\n\nThat all changed with running. And getting in shape. But thats not what I want to talk about. Thats not getting something off my chest. What I really need to get off my chest is the girl I met because of those great changes I'd made to myself, and the terrible mistakes I made with her that dashed them all away. \n\nI don't need to tell you about the love we had for each other, because we all know love is always different, always indescribable. To put it simply, she was a great light to me,  my own personal sun. Even though I was happier and healthier then I'd ever been, I still had a dark side, dark thoughts, dark fears, utterly inherent to my nature. \n\nShe was younger, but not at all less mature. But school years would have it that I was a senior when she was a sophomore. Our time has a high school couple was severely limited. Little wedges started to appear, but they were adversities easily conquered. I loved her so deeply that I told her at the end of July that I wanted to still be with her when I went off to college. She was so relieved that we cried together.\n\nCollege was as usualy, wonderful at first. I hadn't partied in high school - and now most of my friends were younger. Senior party summer didn't happen for me, at all, but we did have lots and lots of sex. So I get to college and yeah, drinking= fun, smoking pot = extra fun. I start to smoke every day. I start to spend all my money on it ($25 a week allowance). My friends get me drunk, and eventually get snippy that I don't pitch in. Fine, I say, but then I insist on getting extra drunk. \n\nAnd, as it turns out, the ultimate consequence of me drinking too much is that I can no longer control my desire for women. \n\nThe first girl I cheated on her with was not a looker, and it only went as far as second base. She was a dorm-mate, we were partying in my room, suddenly we were the only two left and making out. I propositioned her to give me a blow job, she refused, and my drunk brain relized I probably wasn't going to get what I wanted. (And no, even severely drunk, rape does not even enter as a possibility. )\n\nThe next morning I awoke with a horrible hangover. I did everything I usually did and it didn't go away. Then I thought it was hunger, and it wasn't that. It was guilt. But I said nothing.\n\nA week or two later, a friend is having a fantastic birthday party, also in the dorm. A blonde girl, a stranger who appeared out of thin air, apparently one of those friends of a friend from some other other college, is drinking directly across from me. I don't remember if it was just the alcohol, or the conversation, or both, but for someone reason again the party dissappears and we're left alone. Again, I hit the ball, and am rounding second base when someone tries to retun to to their room to clean up after the party. He sees me, remembers I have a girlfriend. Minutes pass. We're still making out hardcore. My roommate comes in basically picks me up by the ribcage and drags me out, I'm pissed as hell, and am faced with like 5 of my friends judging my drunk ass, which can hardly stand. \n\nThe next morning I again awake in utter misery, but this time I call her. And it 7 in the morning I bawl and bawl as I tell her about what I did, how sorry I was. I tell her about both times, and my shame.... was.... boundless.\n\nAnd then here was the first really selfish mistake - I told her that we needed to make this an open thing. I knew she was probably as horny as I was, and I was hoping she too could find someone that would be appropriate to just fuck and release that awful tension. I don't know why I was so naive, so stupid. Obviously when I said this to her it was crushing for her. She didn't have that option at all, aside from the fact that there was no partying, there weren't any other guys she felt attracted to. \n\nBut we keep in contact, as close contact as texting all day every day is. The video chats are sweet. I have come to prefer weed to alcohol almost completely and dont drink as heavily anymore. But the sexual tension is still building for me. The last weekend of school an older girl I'd met in the darkroom texts me out of the blue, and I, utterly baffled and excited, seize the chance. \n\nTwo weeks later we've finally seen each other again. I've been almost totally alone for a week, and i'm acting really strangely. I'm really rude and forceful to her on our first date back, basically trying to be a porn star. It was stupid. She was not impressed. She was also totally crushed that I couldn't wait one more weekend. I bit my tongue - it had been the last weekend of school yes, but our reunion had been delayed by another week because she went to go see a concert. That concert happened to be on my birthday (and I have a history of having bad luck with women on my birthday- the most dramatic being dumped on it [with prom being the previous night]). \n\nBut even this she forgives me for. Again, she is like the light of my life, and she's all I want, all that makes me happy, is to see that star burning brighter and warmer. And again, there are little wedges. And again, I feel very lonely without her. I didn't have a cell phone that worked in my area at this time (it worked great at school, out of state.) so suddenly we can't text all the time. Horrible, horrible mistake, is to ever lower the amount of contact you have for the reason of laziness. I mistake I had already made and not fully learned from.\n\nI'm eventually invited to a party from my high school classmates. I've never been to one of their parties. I bring bud, come too early, yatta yatta. The night goes on, and I don't really feel all that comfortable, except outside smoking with the guys. THe night goes on,  I get much too wasted, and I try to have a threesome. With a guy and a girl that was not my girlfriend.\n\nIn the mornign I couldn't forgive myself. We broke up a month later. I haven't been happy since. This was 3 years ago.\n\nNow its a little off my chest.","author":"nighttimecoughmedici","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been depressed since I was young.

She didn&amp;#39;t have that option at all, aside from the fact that there was no partying, there weren&amp;#39;t any other guys she felt attracted to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we keep in contact, as close contact as texting all day every day is. The video chats are sweet. I have come to prefer weed to alcohol almost completely and dont drink as heavily anymore. But the sexual tension is still building for me. The last weekend of school an older girl I&amp;#39;d met in the darkroom texts me out of the blue, and I, utterly baffled and excited, seize the chance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later we&amp;#39;ve finally seen each other again. I&amp;#39;ve been almost totally alone for a week, and i&amp;#39;m acting really strangely. I&amp;#39;m really rude and forceful to her on our first date back, basically trying to be a porn star. It was stupid. She was not impressed. She was also totally crushed that I couldn&amp;#39;t wait one more weekend. I bit my tongue - it had been the last weekend of school yes, but our reunion had been delayed by another week because she went to go see a concert. That concert happened to be on my birthday (and I have a history of having bad luck with women on my birthday- the most dramatic being dumped on it [with prom being the previous night]). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even this she forgives me for. Again, she is like the light of my life, and she&amp;#39;s all I want, all that makes me happy, is to see that star burning brighter and warmer. And again, there are little wedges. And again, I feel very lonely without her. I didn&amp;#39;t have a cell phone that worked in my area at this time (it worked great at school, out of state.) so suddenly we can&amp;#39;t text all the time. Horrible, horrible mistake, is to ever lower the amount of contact you have for the reason of laziness. I mistake I had already made and not fully learned from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m eventually invited to a party from my high school classmates. I&amp;#39;ve never been to one of their parties. I bring bud, come too early, yatta yatta. The night goes on, and I don&amp;#39;t really feel all that comfortable, except outside smoking with the guys. THe night goes on,  I get much too wasted, and I try to have a threesome. With a guy and a girl that was not my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the mornign I couldn&amp;#39;t forgive myself. We broke up a month later. I haven&amp;#39;t been happy since. This was 3 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now its a little off my chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","user_reports":[],"downs":0,"author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null}

I kinda laughed, and said, ''Why do you say so many people died here?'' I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable tho, it's like I knew he was somewhat right. ''Dude, it's like the ocean, they'll never find you, uno? I bet this place is crawling with dead bodies!'' ''Alright man, chill. No ghost shit.''

My hand shakes as i write this, I heard gasping everywhere all directions.Then tons of voices men,women,children,old people and some scary voices that were screaming.

He was still shaken up. ''Scott..Sc..Scott..'' ''Its me man, what happened, I need to take you to the hospital.'' He hugged me as if he was a child who.just had a horrible dream. He sobbed and said things i couldn't make out. Finally when he calmed down. He told me what had happened. He said, ''When you left I went to sleep, my alarm went off on my watch and I woke up. I was kinda hungry and got out of the jeep and went to the cooler, I saw someone walking towards me, I thought it was you scott, I just was watching them walk towards me then I knew it wasn't you, they had on a black hoodie and black pants, there hands were in their pockets and their head was down I asked if he was ok?

I grabbed his shoulder and he immediately stopped, I about ran into him! He turned so slowly to me, I know you won't believe me but it got cold dude, when he turned. I backed away a few feet. He took his hand out of his pocket and had sand in his hand and then he said, I've been waiting for you John, you and scott.

Not the belief in my story, no. I really could not care if it goes believed or not, I'm not giving you insight into my life for that reason.\n\nLike I said, I need your belief in *me*. I need some of you...just one of you...to say that this has happened to you, or somebody you know. I'm beginning to cry as I write this down but please, somebody please, tell me I'm not crazy.\n\nI've lost everybody who was once close to me, my parents think I've been doing drugs and as a result need therapy. My friends just fucking laugh at me, they don't even have the courtesy to do it behind my back anymore. Of course Amy left me as soon as everyone started calling me crazy, two years we were together, I loved her. I still love her.\n\nGreat, tears. \n\nI don't know how long I have got to write this down, it's nearing the evening. I shouldn't be here by the time it is dark. Not doing that this time.\n\nOkay, you're all probably thinking the same thing by now, 'Scare us already!'. But to everyone reading this, I can't promise I will. I'm not a writer, or even remotely good at using rhetoric to aid suspense. Heck, I failed my English AS in college...All I had to do was a review of Gladiator. My tutor went to great lengths to reiterate how shit it was, in front of the class. \n\n\"And now this is an example of what *not* to do\".\n\n *How subtle*, Mr Williams was never my biggest fan, nor I his.\n\nAnyway, I can't promise I'll scare you because I'm not writing you a story. This is just me, in the moment, getting out what I can, while I can. While I've been typing this, I've thought of a good way to structure it all. Quite pleased with it actually.\n\nI'm going to type, word for word, the journal out first. Then I'm going to give you my experiences. But I'm not crazy, keep that in mind. I'm really, really not crazy.   \n\nI guess I should include some kind of backstory. I don't really wan't to give my location away, but I'm from England, UK. I've not properly browsed this sub before, and so have never really read any of the stories posted (I've skimmed through a few). I don't know if this is what I believe it to be or not; a place where people post inexpiable things. The bit on the side says it's for stories and such, but the 'stories' seem so real. I apologize in advance if I have the wrong place though, I just found it the other day whilst browsing Reddit. Maybe you all could point me in the right direction, to a blog somewhere, or another sub?\n\nAnyway I'm getting distracted. I'm 19, and like I said from England. I..uh, wouldn't have said I was a 'believer' in Ghosts and the after life and such, well not before this anyhow. Don't get me wrong, I didn't dismiss the idea of spirituality or religion, it just wasn't for me. This one time, I was staying over at my Dads (Oh yeah, my parents are divorced), and I was woken up at around 3AM by pots banging in the Kitchen. I went downstairs and before I could touch it the Kitchen door to the hallway swung open.\n\nQuite obviously the wind, but I'm telling you this so you understand that I think of myself as a rational guy. Other people used to as well.\n\nLike I said, my parents are divorced. Before this, I had a great time growing up, and a house I adored.\n\nThis fucking house though. We had to move after the split, and rented some crappy small place as my Mum didn't have a full time job. I helped her out with money where I could, but it wasn't until she met her boyfriend that we could get out of there. Since I haven't masked Amy's name, I won't mask his. His name is John, and he's not actually relevant to my story...well, aside from advocating I stop 'using drugs' and giving the idea to my Mum. \n\nWhen my Mum met John, that's when we moved here. The worst day of my life, except I didn't know it yet.\n\nSo John is a builder. He owns his own small company, and as far as I'm aware is great at what he does. The thing is, this house was big enough only for three rooms. There's 5 of us. Me, my younger brother, my younger sister, and then my Mum and John.\n\nI drew the short straw and had to share. Because I had a gf (Amy), and I was pushing 18, I asked John if he could convert the Garage into a room, save me sharing with my brother. He did a great job and you would never have known it wasn't actually a room. So the reason this is important will become apparent in a second, but keep in mind I am in the Garage (it's connected to the house, but still the only 'bedroom' in the house that is downstairs).\n\n\nSo while me and John were clearing the Garage for my room, we had to turn up some of the flooring that was loose. That's when we found the hidden stash. \n\nAs much as I like History, I couldn't guess the date of the stuff in that bag. I still have no clue, so maybe you guys could help. It had in it several round silver? things that looked like coins except had no markings on them whatsoever, a rat/mouse skeleton (This obviously found its way in there by mistake as there was a small hole at the bottom of the bag, but I'll include it anyway), a fountain pen and a small bound book. \n\nWe both looked around for more secret stuff, but just left it all in the corner after throwing out the skeleton. A month later, I'm ready to move into my room and see the bag in the corner. I'd completely forgotten about it in all honesty, but curiosity got the better of me when I remembered about the book.\n\nI swear to you all reading now, that when I went to open it I couldn't. I couldn't undo the bindings so I know for a fact I left it closed and on the side table. When I woke up it was open, on a seemingly random page (it was blank and near the end). I was a bit freaked out, but just dismissed it as my dreaming last night or something. To tell you the truth, I should have payed attention to the fact I genuinely did not open that book. It was like a warning sign saying 'Do not read this book: Weird shit will happen'.\n\nMaybe that's why I began to read it. It was so...tempting. Inviting, almost. I can't quite explain it. I just *wanted* to read that stupid little book.\n\nIt's getting to that time again. I have to go. I'll post the contents of the book tomorrow if I can, and maybe if anything happens again tonight I'll write about that too.\n\nI'm sorry if you're reading this and not scared, I told you that you my story wouldn't scare you just yet. I just need my story out there. I need someone to tell me I'm not crazy.\n\n\nI'll follow up tomorrow. It's gone 9. I really, really should go.\n\n[Update #1] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hhoyc/im_not_crazy_update/)\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2rm4d","id":"1hg5zo","link_flair_text":null,"edited":1372766357,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hg5zo/im_not_crazy/","ups":9,"score":9,"over_18":false,"thumbnail":"default","distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"downs":0,"user_reports":[],"author":"[deleted]","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve sat here a good 20 minutes trying to figure out how to start this, and nothing stands out to me as  much as beginning with the honesty of my &amp;#39;writers block&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need your belief in me, and being honest with you all seems the best way to get that. Not the belief in my story, no. I really could not care if it goes believed or not, I&amp;#39;m not giving you insight into my life for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I need your belief in &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. I need some of you...just one of you...to say that this has happened to you, or somebody you know. I&amp;#39;m beginning to cry as I write this down but please, somebody please, tell me I&amp;#39;m not crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve lost everybody who was once close to me, my parents think I&amp;#39;ve been doing drugs and as a result need therapy. My friends just fucking laugh at me, they don&amp;#39;t even have the courtesy to do it behind my back anymore. Of course Amy left me as soon as everyone started calling me crazy, two years we were together, I loved her. I still love her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Great, tears. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how long I have got to write this down, it&amp;#39;s nearing the evening. I shouldn&amp;#39;t be here by the time it is dark. Not doing that this time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, you&amp;#39;re all probably thinking the same thing by now, &amp;#39;Scare us already!&amp;#39;. But to everyone reading this, I can&amp;#39;t promise I will. I&amp;#39;m not a writer, or even remotely good at using rhetoric to aid suspense. Heck, I failed my English AS in college...All I had to do was a review of Gladiator. My tutor went to great lengths to reiterate how shit it was, in front of the class. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And now this is an example of what &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How subtle&lt;/em&gt;, Mr Williams was never my biggest fan, nor I his.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I can&amp;#39;t promise I&amp;#39;ll scare you because I&amp;#39;m not writing you a story. This is just me, in the moment, getting out what I can, while I can. While I&amp;#39;ve been typing this, I&amp;#39;ve thought of a good way to structure it all. Quite pleased with it actually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to type, word for word, the journal out first. Then I&amp;#39;m going to give you my experiences. But I&amp;#39;m not crazy, keep that in mind. I&amp;#39;m really, really not crazy.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I should include some kind of backstory. I don&amp;#39;t really wan&amp;#39;t to give my location away, but I&amp;#39;m from England, UK. I&amp;#39;ve not properly browsed this sub before, and so have never really read any of the stories posted (I&amp;#39;ve skimmed through a few). I don&amp;#39;t know if this is what I believe it to be or not; a place where people post inexpiable things. The bit on the side says it&amp;#39;s for stories and such, but the &amp;#39;stories&amp;#39; seem so real. I apologize in advance if I have the wrong place though, I just found it the other day whilst browsing Reddit. Maybe you all could point me in the right direction, to a blog somewhere, or another sub?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway I&amp;#39;m getting distracted. I&amp;#39;m 19, and like I said from England. I..uh, wouldn&amp;#39;t have said I was a &amp;#39;believer&amp;#39; in Ghosts and the after life and such, well not before this anyhow. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I didn&amp;#39;t dismiss the idea of spirituality or religion, it just wasn&amp;#39;t for me. This one time, I was staying over at my Dads (Oh yeah, my parents are divorced), and I was woken up at around 3AM by pots banging in the Kitchen. I went downstairs and before I could touch it the Kitchen door to the hallway swung open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quite obviously the wind, but I&amp;#39;m telling you this so you understand that I think of myself as a rational guy. Other people used to as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said, my parents are divorced. Before this, I had a great time growing up, and a house I adored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This fucking house though. We had to move after the split, and rented some crappy small place as my Mum didn&amp;#39;t have a full time job. I helped her out with money where I could, but it wasn&amp;#39;t until she met her boyfriend that we could get out of there. Since I haven&amp;#39;t masked Amy&amp;#39;s name, I won&amp;#39;t mask his. His name is John, and he&amp;#39;s not actually relevant to my story...well, aside from advocating I stop &amp;#39;using drugs&amp;#39; and giving the idea to my Mum. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When my Mum met John, that&amp;#39;s when we moved here. The worst day of my life, except I didn&amp;#39;t know it yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So John is a builder. He owns his own small company, and as far as I&amp;#39;m aware is great at what he does.

How true are your stories regarding your sex-capades? You seem sweet, but of course you have to be able to make fun of yourself and have a heightened character for comedy.  I've often wondered just how innocent you really are.  Also, creepiest thing a fan has said/asked you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfu88/i_am_comedian_amy_schumer_i_saw_bono_in_an/catwepz?context=5)|The racist stuff is me playing a character. the sex stuff is 99% based on fact. the creepiest thing a fan has said to me - i think just asking if it was them insisting on walking me home. and it was Colin Quinn. \n[When are you coming to Utah?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfu88/i_am_comedian_amy_schumer_i_saw_bono_in_an/catwhfb?context=5)|The next time they have the Olympics there.\n[I'm a huge fan. I do stand up locally, and I find that it's extra hard being a female comedienne, as I think we are limited in our material because of what we look like, the assumption that women aren't funny, and that people expect a certain type of comedy from us.  How do you deal with these situations and other assholes who told you that you aren't funny/should quit/sleeping your way to the top?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfu88/i_am_comedian_amy_schumer_i_saw_bono_in_an/catwgms?context=5)|You are right about everything you just said. those stigmas never leave. unfortunately, a great importance is put on our appearance as women above all, and it's horrible.  i do my best to not let it get me down. you do yours. I've only slept with one comedian. and I think it got me to the middle. just be funny, and work hard, and don't worry about all that bullshit. \n[You’re an inspiration to me because I also went to Towson University and now I perform stand up.  Not that I’m even ready for one yet, but I don’t get how “big breaks” work really and would like to hear about what happened with yours.  I assume it was probably Last Comic Standing, but what happened after that, exactly?  Were you aggressively doing stand-up and getting approached with offers?  Did you have an agent or someone who was pitching you to places like Comedy Central for a half-hour Presents and roast appearances?  Or were you trying to get in front of those places yourself and trying to network with comics who were, at the time, better known and more advanced in their careers?  All of the above?  When did you decide you could, financially, afford to do stand-up full time?  Did the decision seem like a frightening risk, or an amazing relief?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfu88/i_am_comedian_amy_schumer_i_saw_bono_in_an/catwbd8?context=5)|I don't think standup is a place for networking or getting discovered too quickly. it's really something you need to spend a lot of time on before getting good, and it's a good idea to hold off before exposing people to your work. there are a couple of times when it felt like a break, but you can't tell a break when it happens to you. you just hope people see your work and like it.

How true are your stories regarding your sex-capades? You seem sweet, but of course you have to be able to make fun of yourself and have a heightened character for comedy.  I&amp;#39;ve often wondered just how innocent you really are.  Also, creepiest thing a fan has said/asked you?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The racist stuff is me playing a character. the sex stuff is 99% based on fact. the creepiest thing a fan has said to me - i think just asking if it was them insisting on walking me home. and it was Colin Quinn.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfu88/i_am_comedian_amy_schumer_i_saw_bono_in_an/catwhfb?context=5\"&gt;When are you coming to Utah?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The next time they have the Olympics there.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfu88/i_am_comedian_amy_schumer_i_saw_bono_in_an/catwgms?context=5\"&gt;I&amp;#39;m a huge fan. I do stand up locally, and I find that it&amp;#39;s extra hard being a female comedienne, as I think we are limited in our material because of what we look like, the assumption that women aren&amp;#39;t funny, and that people expect a certain type of comedy from us.  How do you deal with these situations and other assholes who told you that you aren&amp;#39;t funny/should quit/sleeping your way to the top?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;You are right about everything you just said. those stigmas never leave. unfortunately, a great importance is put on our appearance as women above all, and it&amp;#39;s horrible.  i do my best to not let it get me down. you do yours. I&amp;#39;ve only slept with one comedian. and I think it got me to the middle. just be funny, and work hard, and don&amp;#39;t worry about all that bullshit.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfu88/i_am_comedian_amy_schumer_i_saw_bono_in_an/catwbd8?context=5\"&gt;You’re an inspiration to me because I also went to Towson University and now I perform stand up.  Not that I’m even ready for one yet, but I don’t get how “big breaks” work really and would like to hear about what happened with yours.  I assume it was probably Last Comic Standing, but what happened after that, exactly?  Were you aggressively doing stand-up and getting approached with offers?  Did you have an agent or someone who was pitching you to places like Comedy Central for a half-hour Presents and roast appearances?  Or were you trying to get in front of those places yourself and trying to network with comics who were, at the time, better known and more advanced in their careers?  All of the above?  When did you decide you could, financially, afford to do stand-up full time?  Did the decision seem like a frightening risk, or an amazing relief?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think standup is a place for networking or getting discovered too quickly. it&amp;#39;s really something you need to spend a lot of time on before getting good, and it&amp;#39;s a good idea to hold off before exposing people to your work. there are a couple of times when it felt like a break, but you can&amp;#39;t tell a break when it happens to you. you just hope people see your work and like it. And keep doing it. About 4 years into comedy is when i got filed from my mail-sorting job and relied on comedy. it still feels like a frightening risk.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfu88/i_am_comedian_amy_schumer_i_saw_bono_in_an/catwowh?context=5\"&gt;What color panties are you wearing?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;They&amp;#39;re like trident gum green. sweet mint Orbitz green. but when i put them on they were white.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfu88/i_am_comedian_amy_schumer_i_saw_bono_in_an/catwi3e?context=5\"&gt;Dopest dope you&amp;#39;ve ever smoked?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Amsterdam. in a cafe. near the red light district. oh no wait, i&amp;#39;m remembering, it was mushrooms. but still, it was dope.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfu88/i_am_comedian_amy_schumer_i_saw_bono_in_an/catxhbm?context=5\"&gt;If your phone was hacked, what would be revealed about you?

I just wanted to share my story a little as a quick self-intro to the community as well as ask for some tips you guys might have for fine-tuning.\n\nSo I've been sexually stimulating myself (not sure if I'd really call it fapping) since I was about 11, fapping full-on since 12-13 (I'm 20 now). I still have a fine libido and I've worked to bring my fapping frequency down a lot since my peak fapping days when I was about 16-17. Now I'm down to, at most, MO 5-6 times per month with minimal P which I don't think is bad considering I was doing it every other day at some points. I've also experienced some pretty decent stretches of nofap success in the past, with a couple periods of some 20+ days worth of abstinence and another that lasted about 40-50 days a couple years ago. \n\nNow, I've always been trying to cut back and watch myself just out of my own personal desire to do so but lately I've found more of a reason to and that's why I've come to /r/fnofap for that little bit extra. I've recently started dating this incredible girl who I've come to love very much and I want to make sure everything's in good working order down below in the event that things start getting a little more serious in the bedroom and what have you but also just out of general concern for my sexual health. This is why I feel the need to come to /r/nofap. In the last few years, despite the decrease in number of times of MO on a weekly/monthly basis and having cut out almost all P in my life, I've been noticing some symptoms that I suppose some people might consider in line with ED. The coming and going of wood being inconsistent, decreased ability to sustain wood and duration of wood being a little unpredictable, etc. Like I said, my libido is fine but the whole erectile part of it is what's concerning me a little. I have no problem getting a half-wood or even three-quarter wood but its getting and maintaining the full thing that seems to be the problem, if you want to call it that. Not saying it's impossible, it just doesn't seem as easy as it should.\n\nNow that my little intro is out of the way, I've come to ask for some tips on fine-tuning. As I mentioned, I've managed to successfully cut down my MO frequency over time and have cut out almost all P by blocking the vast majority of sites I used to frequent and can think of but still find myself doing it a handful of times per month. I also do my best to limit the number of times I might run into triggers that might plant the idea that I should fap in my head. When I do MO it's usually because of the need for some release from the stresses in my life. I also don't know what /r/nofap's thoughts on this are, but I've also heard gripping a little too tight during M might contribute to the difficulty to get and sustain wood and I'll admit, I've been guilty of using a bit of a death grip from time to time. All that being said, any tips from you more experienced fapstronauts that might help me improve a little? If you need any more info before you can make a suggestion and/or need clarification on something don't be afraid to ask! I'm here looking for tips and hints and if some extra clarification is needed before a suggestion can be made I'll be happy to provide it.\n\nSorry for the novel and thanks for reading. I'm happy to be here and thanks in advance for all the help and support, I'll do my best to give back and support you all as well.\n\nCheers guys.\n\nTL;DR: looking to improve on my moderate nofap success. any tips for fine-tuning?\n","link_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"ups":1,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1hg2eo/hello_to_rnofap_and_tips_for_finetuning/","score":1,"over_18":false,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":"145 days","downs":0,"user_reports":[],"author":"newtonofap77","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey fapstronauts,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can tell from my username I&amp;#39;m new here although I am not unfamiliar with the principles and ideas behind &lt;a href=\"/r/nofap\"&gt;/r/nofap&lt;/a&gt;.

I&amp;#39;ve also experienced some pretty decent stretches of nofap success in the past, with a couple periods of some 20+ days worth of abstinence and another that lasted about 40-50 days a couple years ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;ve always been trying to cut back and watch myself just out of my own personal desire to do so but lately I&amp;#39;ve found more of a reason to and that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ve come to &lt;a href=\"/r/fnofap\"&gt;/r/fnofap&lt;/a&gt; for that little bit extra. I&amp;#39;ve recently started dating this incredible girl who I&amp;#39;ve come to love very much and I want to make sure everything&amp;#39;s in good working order down below in the event that things start getting a little more serious in the bedroom and what have you but also just out of general concern for my sexual health. This is why I feel the need to come to &lt;a href=\"/r/nofap\"&gt;/r/nofap&lt;/a&gt;. In the last few years, despite the decrease in number of times of MO on a weekly/monthly basis and having cut out almost all P in my life, I&amp;#39;ve been noticing some symptoms that I suppose some people might consider in line with ED. The coming and going of wood being inconsistent, decreased ability to sustain wood and duration of wood being a little unpredictable, etc. Like I said, my libido is fine but the whole erectile part of it is what&amp;#39;s concerning me a little. I have no problem getting a half-wood or even three-quarter wood but its getting and maintaining the full thing that seems to be the problem, if you want to call it that. Not saying it&amp;#39;s impossible, it just doesn&amp;#39;t seem as easy as it should.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that my little intro is out of the way, I&amp;#39;ve come to ask for some tips on fine-tuning. As I mentioned, I&amp;#39;ve managed to successfully cut down my MO frequency over time and have cut out almost all P by blocking the vast majority of sites I used to frequent and can think of but still find myself doing it a handful of times per month. I also do my best to limit the number of times I might run into triggers that might plant the idea that I should fap in my head. When I do MO it&amp;#39;s usually because of the need for some release from the stresses in my life. I also don&amp;#39;t know what &lt;a href=\"/r/nofap\"&gt;/r/nofap&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s thoughts on this are, but I&amp;#39;ve also heard gripping a little too tight during M might contribute to the difficulty to get and sustain wood and I&amp;#39;ll admit, I&amp;#39;ve been guilty of using a bit of a death grip from time to time. All that being said, any tips from you more experienced fapstronauts that might help me improve a little? If you need any more info before you can make a suggestion and/or need clarification on something don&amp;#39;t be afraid to ask! I&amp;#39;m here looking for tips and hints and if some extra clarification is needed before a suggestion can be made I&amp;#39;ll be happy to provide it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the novel and thanks for reading. I&amp;#39;m happy to be here and thanks in advance for all the help and support, I&amp;#39;ll do my best to give back and support you all as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: looking to improve on my moderate nofap success. any tips for fine-tuning?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;"}
