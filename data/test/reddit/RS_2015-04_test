I just recently stumbled across this subreddit and I'm so happy ! I've read alot of posts and they inspired me to start my own journey. \n\nHere is my story I'm 21 years old and was PMOing daily since i was around 13, it was rly driving me nuts. I was already aware that something was wrong - somehow I needed more and more aggressive p to get me going, had only 2 sexual intercourses last year and BOTH gone absolutely wrong(porn ED) due to my imagined ever-increasing axiety while engaging in the act, increasing depressions and kinda social akwardness ( I could socialize and fake interest but wasn't interested at all in what they talk about) . \n\nThat said, I'm 8 days in, it's my first try and im rly feeling GREAT guys !!! \nMy mind is cleared from brain fog, I am SUPER productive, I engage in every conversation and I guess even chicks are attracted to me If I count in that old granny in the supermarket who told me I am super charming and she would wish me to date her granddaughter (this rly made laugh out loud in public, i felt a little bad :O ).\nOh jeah and i got a feeling that my porn induced ED is getting better as well, every morning there is already someone awake, haven't had that in a while ;)\n\nWell as I said I'm only 8 days in and already feel 100% more confident in everything that I do (wasn't the most shy person anyway) , can't imagine how it will be if i rebootet completly, am just so happy that I found this sub !! \n\nNow to you guys I need your help! The urges are still strong, I feel like I have them pretty good under control right now but every little advice how to keep this streak is appreciated, because I aim high. If I set a goal I want to achieve it and my first goal is ATLEAST a total reboot so definitly 90 - 120 days. If you've read all this thanks, I rly appreciate it !! Happpyyy :) :)\n\nSorry if there are major english problems, it's not my native language ! And for those wondering where my 8 day badge is, this is an account I just created, started the badge on my other account !\n\nKeep going fellow Fapstronauts, stay strong and hopefully this will motivate some of you guys as all of your posts motivated me !!! \n\n"}

I have applied to several companies, but have yet to get my foot in the door.  I\u2019ve searched high and low but seem to be unable to find many realistic job openings.  I have hit a wall, and honestly, it has begun to wear on me.  More than anything, I want to begin using my programming knowledge in a real-world environment, and get a taste of what it is like to work with a team of professionals.  I can only imagine how much it would allow me to grow as a programmer and individual. \n\n\nIf any of you have gone through the same difficulties, or have any advice that could help, I would be incredibly thankful.\nSo now a little background on myself.  I am 21 years old, live in Orange County, CA, have been programming since my freshman year of high school, have been studying Computer Science for the past 2 years at a local community college, and will be transferring to a 4 year CS/UC school in the fall.   However, I have found little to no help at my community college with finding an internship.  I really enjoy programming and feel that it comes naturally to me.\n  \nI took my first CS class junior year of high school (AP Computer Science A), and received a 4 on the AP exam.  As of today, I am fluent in C++ and Java.  Instead of writing a huge wall of text I\u2019ll just detail the specifics of my CS background.  Anything I list below I have a great understanding of and can code from scratch.\n\n\n* \t**Object Oriented programming (C++ and Java)**\n\n*      Methods, Objects, Polymorphism, Inheritance, etc.   \n\n* \t**Data Structures**\n\n*     - Queues, Stacks, Lists (single,  double, circular)\n        - Binary Trees (ADT, Red-Black) \n        - Maps, Hash Maps, and Dictionaries\n        - Graphs (Dijkstra's algorithm, Floyd\u2013Warshall algorithm, MST, etc)\n        - Hashing\n        - Search / Sort algorithms\n* \t**UI design**\n*     - JavaFX, AWT\n\nThis list goes on. Like I had mentioned, my understanding of Java and C++ is fairly in-depth.  \n\nI have no problem with things like pointers, iterators, input/ output, method and operator overloading; the little things I see many of my classmates skim over and never really learn the ins and outs of.  Aside from school I have made a huge effort to push myself to learn as much as I can on my own: constantly trying to find more advanced ways of completing assignments, and spending way too much time on sites like Stack Overflow.  I have no issue following previously determined style guides and code documentation standards, and have some experience with HTML, PHP, SQL, and JavaScript.  As for program development, I have done several team projects using AGILE, specifically JIRA.\n\nI\u2019m sure there are a dozen things I haven\u2019t listed that I know as well, but you get the idea.  With this information, any tips or advice on finding internships, building a better resume, etc. would mean *a lot*.  I know I can code well, but not being able to use all these skills I have spent hundreds of hours learning and practicing has got me in a slump.  It\u2019s somewhat exhausting to spend so much time with something and have little to show others for it.   It would just be nice to get a foot in the door, and have some sort of tangible reward for all the hard ward I have put in thus far.\n\n\nFor those of you that spent to time to read this, *I really appreciate it*.","media":null,"name":"t3_30zpao","link_flair_css_class":"advice","gilded":0,"id":"30zpao","archived":false,"num_comments":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"lolmycat","stickied":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/30zpao/ive_hit_a_wall_and_could_really_use_some_help/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"created":1427850728,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qj8o","edited":false,"score":4,"quarantine":false}

Live in an apartment with a roommate @ ~$570/month. Bills are maybe $100 a month.  Car debt: $13,000 @3.29% interest w/ 47 remaining payments. Payments are around $300 a month, and about 10% goes to interest. Health insurance is $70 a month. Car insurance is like $1,400 a year or so. I have about 10k in the bank. I'm in a full time graduate school program on 100% loans, I don't have any income. I take about $17,000 twice a year in federal student loans. I use this to pay for everything: rent, food, gas, school stuff, clothes, etc. This will put me at $136,000 in loans when I graduate in 2017.   None of my loans are subsidized - I think it's the HSC Fed Direct Unsub Loan. I think the interest is 6.8%. I already have about $4,000 in interest that's built up on it. I would like to pay off my car with my money in the bank and still have money to live on. I have the option of taking an additional $10,000 in loans per year with the Grad PLUS loan.  If I took that out, I think the interest is even higher, but I could pay off my car and then my only debt would be the student loans. Why do I want to do this? I would like to have the title to my car just in case anything happens with school or my health and I don't have the car taken away. Also, there's are a number of job opportunities that either have the government forgive your loan over a few years, or as part of signing an employment contract, they pay off a percentage of your loans for each year you work. BOTH of these options work the same if you have $100,000 or $200,000 in loans. It's all based on percentage of total loans. So, I should just max out my loans, right? We had a presentation at school where we were told that this actually does happen if you accept the right job. Even if I don't get in the program, I'm already gunna have $136,000 in debt, why not $146,000. or ever $166,000 and take out the extra loan each year for the next three years? Good idea? Bad idea?

We hit it off, and I got her number. We texted a little bit for the next week or so and got really comfortable with each other really quickly. She told me about her anxiety and I told her about mine as well as my depression. We joked a lot and kinda remarked on how quickly we clicked.\n\nThe next weekend we decided to hang out and went out with some of her friends to local bars. We ended up spending the night together and cuddling and kissing a lot, but nothing further. She's really an awesome girl and I love spending time together and learning about her. We've continued talking all the time and we've started expressing that we care about each other and sometimes be all cutesy. We'll go out with friends when we can and she'll come over some nights to cuddle and watch movies. Last week Tuesday we went out on our first 'official' spur of the moment date.\n\nI understand how it's still very early even knowing each other, and I am in no means in any rush with her.

I'm 25 years old. I started taking it my second year of college 3 years ago. It was an on and off thing, usually taking it when I needed it. When I graduated I stopped taking it when I started working but shortly after I went back on the drug.\n\nFast forward to now and I think I am addicted to it. I can stop taking it for a few days without any withdraws but the only time I have done that recently is when I was out of pills.\n\nAfter a year of taking it, why do I think I am addicted to it? \nFirst off, I have been trying to improve myself. I have been reading more and more. As a high school dropout I never did read any books. Now I have been reading \"self-help\" books, practicing mindfulness (meditating) and learning how to cook (4-Hour Chef).\n\nWhen I am on it I get so relaxed, my mind becomes clear and I don't have racing thoughts but I become lazy. I don't want to do anything, I don't want to talk to anyone. I just want to either read a book or play video games.\n\nI think taking Ritalin has also screwed with the way I look at my job and career. 2 years ago I started as an intern and kicked ass. Moved up to full time employee and did some great work. These past 8 months I feel like I have been slacking. I hardly do my work, I am always on Reddit, YouTube, Facebook.. etc. This usually happens when I take Ritalin. Once I begin to focus on something I can't get my mind off of it. When I am not focusing on work, I can't direct my focus towards my work. This has caused me to hate my job. I want to quit but I can't. \n\nI've been looking into starting my own online business but how I can have a successful business when I can't excel at my current job? How can I focus on a business when I can't focus on my own job? I feel like all this is happening because of my medicine but I can't stop taking it.\n\nAnother sign: My girlfriend and I have been trying to go on a diet and I can't stay motivated to stay on the diet. I keep eating snacks, drinking soda and eating foods that are not recommended for the diet. I keep telling myself \"once I start working out I will be able to keep on track with a good diet.\" When I take my pills I have no energy to work out! I'm just tired and would rather use my brain to learn than work out. I think taking these pills are one of the reasons why I have gained weight!\n\nI want to get back to being passionate about my job again. I want to get back to the old me. The one who was full of energy all the time and made everyone laugh but I think this addiction has ruined me. I haven't told my girlfriend this because I don't want to start a fight. I need help :(\n\n\n**tldr** I think I'm addicted to Ritalin.

For background, I am 16 and a junior in high school and the plan up until now has been that I will start T a few months before graduating next year, so that I will have been on hormones for some time when I start college. \n\nI got accepted into an 8-week long program at Stanford this summer and will be presenting as male during my time there as kind of a test drive for my full time transition. I recently entertained the idea with my therapist of taking a low dose of hormones over the summer to help me pass, and then stopping when the school year starts and starting up again at the original start date. He said that probably wouldn't fly by most endos because the double starting of the dose means a double attack on the liver and whatnot. So I suggested that I could start the low dose, and then just continue it throughout the school year and just raising it in that few months before graduation. Obviously this means I would display some masculine characteristics while I'm still presenting as female, but that really does not bother me. Unless my voice has dropped quite a lot and I'm growing a lot of facial hair I really don't mind. He said that while that plan poses similar dangers, an endocrinologist might be more willing to allow it. \n\nMy therapist said he would check with two endocrinologists he knows and get their opinions, but what do you guys think? Would it be feasible for me to be on a low dose for ~9 months while presenting as female? Thanks for any thoughts. \n\nEDIT: so my therapist contacted two endos, one who works exclusively with adults and one who works with adolescents- so far only the first has replied, and said that he would actually not give clearance to this plan- so now i'm waiting for the second's opinion.","media":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.ftm","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1427848931","subreddit":"ftm","media_embed":{},"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Low dose for a long period of time before increasing?","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null}

I had ALWAYS had signs, but apparently it wasn't widely known about/doctors didn't care enough to do anything about it. An ultrasound showed dozens of cysts, ovaries \"like a Christmas tree\" according to my RE.\n\nThings happened, now it's almost 10 years later. I had a few early miscarriages, split up with my partner, decided I didn't want kids. Lost about 65 lbs so far doing slightly modified Keto. Pretty regular periods, but still some problems with them/PCOS. Got put on Tri Nessa but after 2 months where I spent more time with a period than without, I sought a PCOS specialist.\n\nWell. I saw him today. After asking me tons of questions AND fielding every single one of mine, he wanted to do an ultrasound, which I had expected. But then out of left field, he also told me he suspects I may have endometriosis due to my meeting all the basic criteria except one. I'm 33, and spent 3 years dealing with infertility docs, and not a single one ever brought this up. So we do the ultrasound, and in addition to the expected PCOS cysts, there is a large, irregular-shaped one that he believes is an endometrial cyst.\n\nHe was very pro-Keto (yay!) and took me off the BCP. He Rxd some bloodwork, 2 months of progesterone, and a follow up in a month to talk about laparoscopic surgery to check for/remove any endometriosis as well as ovarian drilling. He said he would likely put me back on Metformin, which I took in my TTC days, but would not prescribe spiro for hair, and that I would likely see better results for hair with the drilling. He said after that point we could discuss either another form of BCP or something like the implant, (he specifically did not recommend Depo and I do not want an IUD).\n\nRight now I'm kind of freaking out. I have a *thing* about doctors as it is, and even more so when it comes to surgery. My main goals are a lessening of the PCOS symptoms and continued weight loss (I want to lose about 70-80 more pounds).\n\nI'm sure there are those of you have done this. I did a search but got a lot of horror stories from a long time ago and freaked myself out even more. Who's done it recently? Has it helped you at all?

Anyways, I left realm a while ago with around 6 8/8s and all UTs with a boatload of mules full of wealth. Since I gave away my original account and still have the mules, I couldn't be bothered with email verification and made an nameless NPE and got to 5/8 without trading. I had to make a name to stop myself from jumping off a bridge trying to get the attack needed for my wizard. Now that I'm 6/8 after only 2 days, the game seems nostalgic with all the mechanics and trading habits that I fell in love with from the start. All these new things were just confusing but added some nice end game that scared even old veterans like me. One complaint I have that prompted me to go on this Reddit is USWest trading. Scammers... When I left, there was a wait between deselecting items and accepting, apparently, they got rid of that. The first time I fell prey was just losing 3 dex for nothing and I was just like: Meh. 5 minutes ago, I just lost a full inventory of attack that I wanted a life for.

{"media":null,"selftext":"So, I'm 18 and a senior in high school, but I take most of my classes at college because I hate that place. Because of this, I only have to take 2 classes at the high school. That bit of information is fairly irrelevant, but whatever.\n\n\nAnyway, me and a group of friends at the high school recently started playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons earlier this year. Whenever we are talking about D&amp;D though, we always use a code where we refer to it as \"Drinking &amp; Driving\" (Drinking and Driving = D&amp;D = Dungeons and Dragons). All of us are pretty much friends with everyone else at school because stereotypes and cliques are just stupid and immature, so even if people found out that we play D&amp;D, nobody would really care about it. We honestly don't care if anyone finds out if we play D&amp;D or not, but we just always refer to it as \"drinking and driving\" because it's kind of a running joke amongst us now. Heck, most people in our class know what we are talking about when we refer to drinking and driving anyway because like I said, we mainly just say it as a joke now.\n\n\nWe were all going to play this past weekend, but two of our players bailed on us so we weren't able to play. Both of these people sit next to me in my anatomy class. So today in class, I was badgering them about not drinking and driving this weekend. After some more talking about drinking and driving, I was seeing if they wanted to drink and drive this weekend or not. After some persuading, they both agreed to drink and drive this weekend along with the other players.\n\n\nFast forward to my next class period. I'm sitting in art class and working on a new commission that I received over the weekend (I'm an artist and that's actually how I've made my money all throughout high school, so screw part time jobs). Anyway, so I'm sitting in art class when all of a sudden I'm called to the office for no reason.\n\n\nUpon getting there, I am told that the principle would like to speak with me. Our principal is a total dick by the way. After waiting for a few minutes, I'm finally called back there to see him. Turns out, somebody told him about our plans to \"drink and drive\" this weekend. This guy absolutely chewed me out. He went on and on about how I was dissing my friends for not drinking and driving this past weekend and how we shouldn't even be around alcohol at our age. He also went off about how I persuaded and forced my 2 friends in anatomy class to get drunk and drive around in a car this weekend and about how dangerous that was. I tried explaining to him that we simply used that as 'code' for a game that we all play on the weekends. He's never even heard of dungeons and dragons and he's probably 50+ years old. Surprisingly, he at least half way listened to me. Apparently the punishment was going to be a lot more severe, but after listening to my explanation he said that he could see what I was trying to say but that now it had turned into a \"he said she said\" situation (what?) and that he didn't know who to believe. I said that I could bring my friends up there to explain to him what I meant, but he said that would be dragging out the situation and that he had already made up his mind so it would do no good.\n\nSo all in all, I was written up for 3 days of in-school-suspension which I really don't even care about since I'm only at school for a total of 2 hours anyway. The only part of the punishment that actually pisses me off is the fact that I can't exempt my anatomy final since I have an office referral now. I can pass it no problem since that class is pretty easy and I'm good at anatomy, but still. Screw you, high school.\n\nTL;DR: I apparently forced 2 children to \"drink and drive\" and was almost expelled from school because of it.","retrieved_on":1440820875,"ups":6,"permalink":"/r/tifu/comments/30zunw/tifu_by_trying_to_play_dd_this_weekend/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"TIFU by trying to play D&amp;D this weekend.","subreddit":"tifu","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1427849482","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.tifu","quarantine":false,"score":6,"edited":1427849967,"created":1427853082,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2to41","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/30zunw/tifu_by_trying_to_play_dd_this_weekend/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"author":"jack_wagon_jacob","from":null,"is_self":true,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":8,"archived":false,"id":"30zunw","name":"t3_30zunw","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null}

After high school, it was sort of a relief for both of us to have our own separate groups of friends, but that's not to say we didn't become friends with each other's groups. In my group of friends, we've got a gay transgender emo, a tattoo-obsessed gamer girl, a guy roughly my age with social anxiety, and another guy who's main sort of gimmick is that he wears a hat all the time and doesn't eat much except breakfast cereal. Now, in my girlfriends group, we have a foreign exchange student (Allison), a guy who is basically like a human-database for Marvel comics (Kyle) (ask this guy anything to do with Marvel, he knows the answer), an engaged couple who don't look a day over sixteen but are actually 21 and 22 (Lindsay and Matt), and finally Derek. Derek is a cunt. In every sense of the word, Derek is a cunt. I think so. My girlfriend thinks so. Allison, Kyle, Lindsay and Matt think so. Why? Well kiddie's lemme tell ya.\n\nDerek is not only a cunt, but he's a neck-beard cunt. I'm assuming you've all heard of neck-beards. Imagine that, but whinier, more opinionated, more self-centered, more misogynistic, more unhygienic, and just overall, more of a punchable pile of shit. I mean sure, he does have some legit problems to deal with in his life, like acid reflux, anxiety, dealing with his mother's cancer diagnosis, shit like that. However, while that is something we can sympathize with, it's not a fucking excuse to treat your own friends like shit. It's not an excuse to hold my girlfriend up against a wall and try to forcefully kiss her (she fought him off, don't worry). It's not an excuse to whine like a little bitch just because Allison doesn't want to see you naked. It's not an excuse to brag that you're going to ask 3 different girls on dates, in the same day, over **facebook**. It's not an excuse to call Lindsay a bitch because she won't leave her fiance for you. It's not an excuse to be a passive aggressive dickhole to me and Matt just because we're going out with the girls you want to fuck. It's not an excuse to skip an entire week of classes just because of ONE anxiety attack, that you had on the **weekend**. It's not an excuse to butt in when we're having a group discussion just to change the topic so that it's about you, no matter how irrelevant whatever the hell you're talking about is. \n\nI honestly have no idea why we put up with Derek, I really don't. He's a waste of sperm. I know that seems harsh, but that's how much this fucker pisses me off. He shows NO regard for other people's feelings or opinions, kicks up a fuss if we don't do things his way, sees women as nothing but sex objects and takes other people's stuff without even asking for it. This guys acts like such a damn child, and I can hardly believe this guy turns 25 this year. I'm 19 and even I'm more mature than that! \n\nSo, a couple nights ago, I dreamed I was in a living room. I don't know where. But it was a generic living room: table, tv, couch, couple of chairs, stuff like that. I was on one chair he was on the other, the couch was empty. Neither of us said anything. All we were doing was just watching tv. That's the last things I remember before killing him in the dream. There was no in-between, nothing to trigger me off, all I remember is just watching tv and then standing over him, wrapping my fingers round his fat neck, squeezing the life out of him. It was the strangest dream I've had in my whole life and scared me a lot because it felt real. I felt my hands tense more and more round his throat. I felt the desire to never have to hear him breathe or speak ever again. I felt his eyes say what his mouth couldn't, as they pleaded for mercy. His hands scrambled in any direction imaginable for a route to escape, the veins in the back of my hands bulged with each tensing grip, his eyes went bloodshot and tear-filled. And I felt fear and panic. The sudden realization that right in front of me is the body of a person that was alive and breathing only a minute ago, the way I am now. The realization that I had taken away something that could never be returned. The realization that an unimaginable amount of people will notice his absence: his friends, his family, his employer, his lecturers. \n\nWhen I woke up I had no idea what to think of it. I was certainly glad it was only a dream, but was I only glad about it because I woke up while I was panicking about what to do with the evidence? If I'd woken up earlier, before he died, would I have felt disappointed?\n\nTL;DR Derek is a prick and I had a realistic dream that I strangled him to death.

Fuck's sake my 21'st birthday is coming in 2 months, and I'm worried about how I look. Normally people worry about this stuff when they are getting bullied or something. I'm literally obsessing about how much I weigh and look that it's disgusting. \n\nI'm not who I used to be, I used to not worry about how I looked. \"I know I look good.\" was always in my head, and I truly felt I looked good. I never had any problem attracting women, and no one had said anything about me so I guess I never worried about it.\n\nEver since my anxiety came forth at 18, life has been hell. I won't go into details. I constantly worry about how I look (stomach wise). I check how I look at work around 4 times a day, constantly look at my stomach. Any time I eat anything I just think of how I look and it puts me down. I put **myself** down. I know I have depression and stuff, but damn if this doesn't feel like I'm hopeless.\n\nI'm not even fat or overweight. I'm 5'7 and I've been around 135 pounds since I was 17. Now I just checked my weight and I'm at 144. It might be because its literally the middle of the day because I've weighed myself in the mornings and I've been at 138. \n\nThat 144 felt like a slap in the face. I *feel* like I'm fat. Everyone tells me that I'm not. I don't feel it though. I feel fat, I feel out of shape. I feel like I'm not attractive, and that the first thing a girl notices is how my stomach looks.[This](http://imgur.com/T5u5hDb,Tf5fjBJ,7Q5WXsb#0) is how my stomach looks. My dad just laughs at me when I tell him that I feel that I look bad. When I mentioned exercising to lose some weight, he laughed at me. Everyone laughs when I mention it but they don't understand. It's not a fucking joke to me. I seriously worry about this or think about it around 25 times a day, minimum. I constantly have to lift up my shirt to check how I look. I don't even know what to do anymore.\n\nI just feel like crying and not eating anything, and just stopping it all. The worst part is that I don't think it would solve anything.\n\nMy whole life has been hell, and this anxiety I've had since I was 18 has been the cherry on top.

I'm afraid its ruining my life but I can't stop taking it.\n\nI've been taking Methylphenidate (Ritalin) for a while now. I'm 25 years old. I started taking it my second year of college 3 years ago. It was an on and off thing, usually taking it when I needed it. When I graduated I stopped taking it when I started working but shortly after I went back on the drug.\n\n\nFast forward to now and I think I am addicted to it. I can stop taking it for a few days without any withdraws but the only time I have done that recently is when I was out of pills.\nAfter a year of taking it, why do I think I am addicted to it? First off, I have been trying to improve myself. I have been reading more and more. As a high school dropout I never did read any books. Now I have been reading \"self-help\" books, practicing mindfulness (meditating) and learning how to cook (4-Hour Chef).\n\n\nWhen I am on it I get so relaxed, my mind becomes clear and I don't have racing thoughts but I become lazy. I don't want to do anything, I don't want to talk to anyone. I just want to either read a book or play video games.\n\n\nI think taking Ritalin has also screwed with the way I look at my job and career. 2 years ago I started as an intern and kicked ass. Moved up to full time employee and did some great work. These past 8 months I feel like I have been slacking. I hardly do my work, I am always on Reddit, YouTube, Facebook.. etc. This usually happens when I take Ritalin. Once I begin to focus on something I can't get my mind off of it. When I am not focusing on work, I can't direct my focus towards my work. This has caused me to hate my job. I want to quit but I can't.\n\n\nI've been looking into starting my own online business but how I can have a successful business when I can't excel at my current job? How can I focus on a business when I can't focus on my own job? I feel like all this is happening because of my medicine but I can't stop taking it.\nAnother sign: My girlfriend and I have been trying to go on a diet and I can't stay motivated to stay on the diet. I keep eating snacks, drinking soda and eating foods that are not recommended for the diet. I keep telling myself \"once I start working out I will be able to keep on track with a good diet.\" When I take my pills I have no energy to work out! I'm just tired and would rather use my brain to learn than work out. I think taking these pills are one of the reasons why I have gained weight!\n\n\nI want to get back to being passionate about my job again. I want to get back to the old me. The one who was full of energy all the time and made everyone laugh but I think this addiction has ruined me. I haven't told my girlfriend this because I don't want to start a fight. I need help :(\n\n","media":null,"name":"t3_30zw4l","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"id":"30zw4l","archived":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":3,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"I_Need_To_Vent_15","stickied":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/30zw4l/i_think_im_addicted_to_my_medicine/","secure_media":null,"created":1427853711,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qwvc","score":5,"edited":false,"quarantine":false}

Starting as early as I can remember up until age 10 when I moved I would go to the same doctor for routine check-ups about twice a year or so.  \n\nEvery time I was there, I would go into the room alone with the doctor and he would check my heart rate, putting his hand on my back, on my stomach, then on each breast.  \n\nAfter that he would tell me to pull my pants and underwear down. He would wash his hands and put on gloves. I remember once he said \"Wow! That was really fast! Good job\" to me pulling down my pants. I guess I was used to the routine. He would proceed to insert his fucking ice cold gloved fingers into me and feel around for a while before telling me to get dressed and sending me on my way. I can still imagine it like it was yesterday.\n\nAll throughout my childhood I just assumed that this was normal. It happened at every doctor's visit, after all. It was only with that one doctor, though. However, after talking to my friends about it once I got into middle school (I'm 21 now), I realized that this happened to NO ONE ELSE that I knew.  \n\nI remember once, after we moved, we were on our way to the new doctor and my sister said \"is this doctor going to rape us like doctor _____?!\" and my mom slammed the brakes of the car and yelled at her, saying to never ever talk like that again and that he was a great doctor and would never do anything like that.  \n\nI am puzzled and hurt. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there something a parent can do to knowingly allow the doctor to do this to their children even without any complaints of pain down there from the child?   \n\nI'm not sure what to do. I do not want to bring this up to my therapist because he forced me to report a different case of sexual abuse I experienced when I was a minor. I do not want to forced into reporting anything when I am still unsure of what was really going on. Talking to my mom about it is not an option.  \n\nSo my question is this: Was this abuse?  \n\nEdit: A couple of years ago I googled him and found him to still be in practice. I was disgusted. I just looked him up again and found his relatively recent obituary. I am even more disgusted.

We had a meeting with our IVF nurse the other day to go over any loose ends and to ask any questions we may have had. We spoke a little bit more in depth about how we think this cycle is going to go, and she was very, VERY optimistic about it - to the point that it's not even making me feel better, just freaking me out. My husband is 26 and I'm 25. I was diagnosed with PCOS, however I naturally got pregnant on my own and gave birth to a healthy child back in 2011. My husbands SA was normal, and I was told all of my numbers look good as well. My uterus is \"beautiful\" and we are both healthy overall. I brought up that we were thinking about having 2 embryos transferred and she gave me this look like I just asked her to transfer 10. I told her that I want us to have the best chances possible and my husband and I both agreed that while multiples wouldn't be ideal, it wouldn't be the end of the world either. She basically then went on to say that she thought that it was a horrible idea (in more or less words) because transferring one should be just fine. She keeps telling me I have \"nothing to worry about\". I feel like this type of optimism is not good when it comes to something as uncertain as IVF. I feel like if this cycle fails, it's going to be 10x more of a disappointment than if she were to help us feel like it's a 50/50 chance. In our heads, we know it is, but it's just reassuring to trust that your doctors are going to be very level headed and real about the situation alongside with you. Most of the time, it's the patients who are floating in lala land and it's the doctors who have to bring them back down to earth. Ugh, I don't know.

I was sad for a while after I found out I was pregnant (it was planned but a bit of a shock still). I told my mom about my not planned pregnancy back in september of last year and how it ended in miscarriage. Well... That went ***great***... /s\n\nShe told me I would be a shitty mom and that it was a good thing I miscarried and that I'd just be another women in the line of women that my spouse had babies with. For reference, he had his first (an oops baby) at 19 (15 years ago) who was then adopted. And just had his second four years ago when he was married. His marriage ended badly and they got a divorce and now he has 50/50 custody. So if you count that as a line of women... Well fuck. Whatever. After the miscarriage I was so heartbroken that I decided that I actually really did want a baby, my relationship with my spouse is stable and very good. I make really good money in IT and we live in a wonderful community in a two bedroom condo. We've known each other for several years and been together for over one. Yes, our relationship is somewhat new, but I have a disease which makes childbearing as I get older veryyy dangerous for me and baby. Even if things did ever turn south with my spouse I would still be able to support a baby and myself without any issues.\n\nSo now I'm 14 weeks pregnant. I didn't tell my mom and wasn't planning on it until 12 weeks because I didn't need that stress in my life. Well this past week I told my grandmother because I'd need support with telling my nmom. My grandmother has been hinting at my nmom that I need to have a serious conversation with her and finally my mom asked me wtf is going on today. Essentially she asked if everything was okay. I said yes it was but that we did need to talk and that it wasn't about something bad. My nmom responded saying that that was for her to determine. So I said well it depends on how you handle the news. She 'sighed' in text which I fucking hate.\n\nI decided for once to stand up for myself and this happened:\n\nMe: None of that stuff either... I know you may not be pleased but I honestly don't want to hear it\n\nMom: Well thanks for considering my feelings and opinion. You just set a very negative tone that frankly makes me not sure I want to know now.\n\nMe: Well then we will table it for tonight cause I'm tired and still in class and haven't eaten\n\nI had taken a 2.5 hour serger class tonight and was exhausted. She never responded but earlier today had made sure that she wanted me to know that I needed to get my body under control because I'm getting fatter. I'm a bit on the chubbier side right now and my mom just recently lost 80lbs on a diet that isn't healthy and I never want to subject myself to especially not pregnant.\n\nAnyway... This conversation led me to being pissed off. I was sad because I was losing what I thought I deserved during pregnancy. A supportive mom who would share stories with me about my birth and hold my hand if something wasn't 100%. Is that so much to ask for!? Apparently. So now I'm pissed. I'm pissed that my mom can't be normal. I'm pissed that she can't just be supportive and deal with her feelings on her own time. I'm pissed that she's judgmental and toxic and right now have no issues with texting her that I'm pregnant and ignoring her forever. I'm pissed because my best friends mom is more excited that I'm pregnant and will be more excited and supportive than my own mother.  I'm pissed because freaking little ceasers doesn't have their nacho crust pizza thing anymore too. And because even after all of this stupid drama I still haven't had the chance to freaking tell her that she's going to be a grandma and I want to be respectful enough to not text her it.

I'm 15 years old, nearing my 16th birthday. I'm a recently converted LeVayen Satanist, I'm still doing my research on it, but I agree with it's standpoints. I was an atheist for about 4 years and I've changed a lot within that time-span, mentally and physically. Before I was an atheist I would have been considered a Christian, but I didn't go to church except for when I was much much younger. \n   I left religion pretty early for a kid that grew up in the generic Christian household with a dad that went to work to support us financially, and a mother that nurtured us. My mom gave us someone that we could be honest and share our thoughts without worry of condemnation, accepts my conversion from theism and always has. My father was accepting, but I don't think he likes it a lot. \n   One of the first things that opened my eyes to actually questioning religion rather than simply accepting it and living by the line \"God made it that way,\" would have to be the conversion of my father from Christianity to Judaism. I was very conflicted during this period of how sudden my father had discarded Jesus, someone who I grew up to see as my savior, so easily. I began to think more in reason, but I was worried to do so as it is seen as disrespectful to doubt God. I shared my dads religious beliefs as he explained to me how the entirety of Christianity is a fluke (no offense.) \n   It wasn't but about a year or nearing two years later that I had finally broke and started questioning God and looking up all these ideas I've never heard of, like evolution and atheism in general. It didn't take me long to completely shed of religion and think with reason and logic. I started becoming very passionate about science, especially stuff you'd see in The Cosmos. I also became more passionate about religion, ironically, and continued my research on religions and all different kinds of beliefs like deism and what not. \n   I encourage everyone who has a belief in a God to question him. In the Christian bible, it is not seen as a sin to do so, the prophet Habakkuk questioned God about the timing and agency of the Lord's plan and was not rebuked. Wouldn't you like to learn more about the God you cherish and love?\n   I left religion because I opened my eyes to reality and reason. I finally had the sense to question divine authority. I began to think about things more logically, and I'm very glad I've done so. I lived a life in fear that if I was defiant to God's word, I would be damned for eternity, that I would suffer forever. I felt like I was finally me, I was not restricted in my own head from fear and 'God.'\n\n ***I did not make this post to offend anyone with a strong faith in their religion, I just wanted to share my story and encourage reason***","retrieved_on":1440820806,"ups":1,"subreddit":"religion","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1427851780","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.religion","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"default","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Why I left religion.","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh39","from_kind":null,"created":1427855380,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/30zzxi/why_i_left_religion/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"score":1,"edited":false,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"num_comments":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"id":"30zzxi","archived":false,"name":"t3_30zzxi","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"author":"[deleted]","from":null,"is_self":true}

Since about 2 months ago, I started getting some really tight hip flexors. I have never had this problem before. What I did before was sit in a squat position for 2-3mins as a warmup, then warm up a little with the bar, and then I was ready to put some weights on.\n\nNowadays... that isn't possible anymore. I need to do butterflies, sumo squat (I think it is called sumo squat, but basically you stand really wide and it stretches the hip flexors really nicely), sit in a squat position for 5mins, do some bar work where I sit in the bottom, and my hip flexors are still not loosened up. This prevents me from getting good positions in my cleans/snatches as I'm having trouble sitting in the hole without feeling my hip flexors.\n\nI noticed that they get tight really fast again, if I rest too long. If I go for 5mins, they go tight again, not REALLY tight, but tight enough for it to be a problem. During squats where I rest for about 3-5 minutes this becomes a problem where I am too scared on going too deep on the first rep because of my hip flexors.\n\nAnd I'm having a hard time seeing that this problem is age-related.

I was wondering if you guys could answer some questions I have.\n\nLast August, being the insecure person I am, I tried jelqing. I think I didn't do it correctly, because after I tried it a couple of times I noticed that my penis was getting smaller and that my erections were getting softer. I stopped, but afterwards I made a series of crucial mistakes that I was conscious of but still committed anyway. The first was that I would always check my penis size to see if it had decreased further, but by doing so I think I damaged my penis tissue even further. An even bigger mistake was that I would occasionally masturbate (I'm not sexually active), which had an even more severe effect. Up until the last month or so, my penis would seem to heal back so that it was around 0.5 in. shorter than what it was before August (it probably would have healed back completely if I never touched it), but recently its dropped to around an inch shorter than what it was originally and it isn't healing back.\n\nObviously, this problem is entirely my fault (I'm not very good at controlling myself). I just want to know how exactly my penis is damaged, if it there is any chance it could heal, and what steps I should take to maximize the chances that it heals (this'll will obviously take a lot of self-control on my part)?

I'm kind of in a down mood today, so I wanted to share how /r/childfree has helped me. This will probably be a generic story that everybody has heard before, kind of. \n\nI haven't always been CF. When I was 18, (I'm 22 now) I was in an abusive relationship. I moved states to be with this guy. It was a poor decision. I wound up getting pregnant and was ecstatic. I think mostly because I was lonely. I was not allowed to talk to my family when my boyfriend was home from work because we were supposed to \"spend time together\" and I had nothing to look forward to besides my minimum wage shit job. I miscarried at 8 weeks, and was absolutely devastated. After this loss however, I seemed to view the world with a little more clarity. I realized that I needed out of this relationship. I thought of myself as pathetic because of how desperately I wanted a kid, and for selfish purposes. And today I look back, wondering what it would be like if I had brought a child into this world with him being the father. He would tell me things like \"if you leave with the baby, I will find you and plant drugs in your house to get custody.\" After we lost the kid, I went back to my home state to get a D&amp;C performed (we were just a state over, a 3.5 hour drive.) I needed my family for support. It was when I came back that I decided to end the relationship. \n\nFor about a year and a half afterwards, I was really weird and baby crazy. I felt like there was something missing from my life. When I look back now, I wonder what the fuck I was thinking, because I have always hated children. I think they're dirty and annoying. I would have been a terrible mother, especially as the person I was four and a half years ago. I have depression, anxiety, and some really crazy tendencies when I get over stressed, and I have just begun to learn how to manage these emotions. \n\nAnyways, I began a relationship with my current boyfriend. We have been together for about a year and a half. Shortly before this I made the decision that I never, ever want children. I felt alone but empowered. I look back and feel embarrassed because of how I almost ruined my entire life (worse than I already had). I've been on reddit for over two years, with different accounts. I saw /r/childfree getting bashed on in some subreddit, and came to check it out. And I'm glad I did, because I spend most of my \"reddit time\" on here. I think you all are great people, and I know that if I ever need support, I have it. And not just for things related to being CF. I really relate to a lot of you in a lot of ways. You make me feel like I'm not as alone, and you really have helped me proudly solidify that I do not want children. I'll always get the occasional bingo from my parents, and people that can't mind their own business, but I know in my heart that I am making the right and responsible decision by never having children. \n\nSo if anyone is dealing with a miscarriage, or has dealt with one and is still hurting, or you don't know what you want, you can always PM me and I'll lend my support. Or you can simply vent. I am glad I miscarried but I will never forget the pain that comes with it if you want/think you want a kid, even if I don't believe I was in the right state of mind. \n\nTLDR: Thought I wanted to be a parent for a brief time, got pregnant, miscarried, was devastated, what the fuck was I thinking?? \n\n","media":null,"ups":49,"retrieved_on":1440820783,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/childfree/comments/3101n9/perspective_from_someone_who_for_a_brief_time/","from":null,"author":"doomblade_","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":7,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"name":"t3_3101n9","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"id":"3101n9","edited":false,"score":49,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/3101n9/perspective_from_someone_who_for_a_brief_time/","secure_media":null,"created":1427856164,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qtwb","stickied":false}

I never write/type what I think and am not sure what this post is going to turn into.\n\nI'm just so tired. Mentally and physically, life just seems like it's kicking my ass. I'm 29 college educated and should by all means be able to be maintaining at least. But I'm not. I'm going to skip over a lot but my biggest mistake of my life was deciding to go to college. I thought I'd do it right, start in community college, transfer to city college and then if necessary go somewhere \u201cgood\u201d once I knew what I wanted to do. I did that but when all was said and done I ended up still ending up with $144,000 in loans before interest for a useless art degree in commercial photography. May things went wrong in school such as my car getting totaled in a hit and run, roommates disappearing and leaving me to foot rent bills I couldn't afford and other roommates stealing my portion of the rent eventually getting evicted, regressing into serious depression (major depressive disorder or MDD specifically). Regardless I worked my ass off, didn't party, did what I was told was good work, made connections and had a shitty full time job while assisting and doing bit work on the side to support myself during and after school. Then the loans started to come due.\n\nMy god I had no idea what I had gotten myself into. I've had a job since 14 and had never bought anything I couldn't afford, or even had a credit card. I had always just known if I couldn't afford it I would just have to do without. Counselors, teachers, and my parents had told me I needed a good education to succeed though and I foolishly dove head first into what now are $1400ish a month loan payments.\n\nI quit my job and moved back home as soon as I realized I wasn't making nearly enough to cover, rent, food, phone bills, anything, and the loans. Unfortunately the same week I saw the number I'd need to be paying my car's transmission failed. So, I basically abandoned everything I owned, that I couldn't sell on craiglist including the car (I did get $1200 for a car I had paid $2700 for a year earlier), in the month I had before the first wave of loans were due. Using that money I bought a $1600 car in CA where I was knowing that would get me much less in CT, put everything else I had in it and drove across the country where all my degree reliant connections were useless, with the hope that I'd be able to find a job while living at home where I could make headway on repaying the loans. If anything in my life has been stable I at least have great and supportive parents. They know they made the wrong call convincing me to go to school and co-signing the loans but they've still helped me out more than I can say.\n\nThat has sort of worked. It took 4 months to find a job, It started with an internship that paid $10 an hour at a furniture store in their advertising department composting in After Effects which I was new to. It was supposed to last one month at which point they would hire me if I proved myself. In the month before the internship began I treated learning the program like a job and on my second day at the internship they were using stuff I was making in ads. Just the same they kept me on at 10hr for 3 months instead of 1 but then did higher me on salaried at $32,000 a year. I thought that was going to be ok. \n\nThen my engine blew up in the $1600 car that got me across the country. It was a Toyota Celica that got 30ish mpg on the cheap gas. This was important as I've got to drive about 50miles a day to get to and from work. My parents thankfully had a 3rd car that they've now been lending me for over a year. It turned out that after taxes and benefits my take home from the job as a compositor is only $1920 a month. The student loans being paid back at the minimum are about $1300 a month, that this third car gets 17mpg on 93 octane so it's costing me about $300 a month to get to work. I'm trying to save up to fix my car as I can't find anything reasonable locally that I have any hope is going to keep running. I'm pretty much stuck going nowhere.\n\nI paid over $15,000 in interest on just one of the 3 loans I have last year an was only able to take $2000 off the principle. At The current rate of repayment if the variable interest rates don't go up I'll be paying these off until I'm over 65. I'm only able to survive right now because my parents are paying for pretty much everything other than the loans, and my dad is 70.\n\nI've picked up a second job on the weekends picking up medical laundry. It brings in another $100ish a week which I'm hoping to used to pay off other bills and maybe eventually get my car running with but it's so disheartening. I'm a 29 year old, living at home with his parents, driving their car, working full time in an advertising department for a company that brings in $100,000,000 a month (I don't see what everything cost just sales numbers) making a take home of just $10.83 an hour with a $144,000 degree, literally picking up shit stained sheets from a convalescent home on the weekends. Not that I have much free time with the full time job with an hour commute each way during the week and the part time job but I have lost all interest in things that I had enjoyed. Biking, photography, snowboarding, even videogames and tv. I've lost any interest in dating and haven't even tried to see anyone in over 4 years.\n\nIt doesn't help that I've fallen back into depression badly too. Last November I voluntarily went to the ER room for an \u201cemergency evaluation\u201d after my Psychiatrist, therapist and normal doctor all called me during work one day asking me to. I ended up being kept there and being put in the in-patient psych ward for being \u201cpassively suicidal.\u201d This was all sorts of not helpful because even with my insurance I then had $2500 bill that my I've been dealing with. I was told I was supposed to attend an out patient program but it was going to cost another $10,000 of which insurance would cover some of but still leave me with an additional $2500 bill. I didn't do it for that reason. I'm honestly not better than I was when I went in. Not that I don't think about it all the time, but I'm not going to kill myself because it'd just put the loans on my parents. Between having to face a dead son and that I'd never do that to them. \n\nSo I just go on day to day going through the paces. I've tried so hard to do the right thing, the honest way, not take advantage of people, not be a burden on my parents, but I just feel like a leech. I just feel like a hollow shell who's sole point is to generate profit for the banks that own my loans, and the company I work for. I'm so unbelievably stressed and depressed I feel like sleep has no regenerative benefit anymore. I can sleep 8, 10, 12, 14 hours and I still have people tell me I look exhausted. I genuinely have trouble remembering what feeling happy, or glad, or hopeful feels like.

For example when I am stressed I have obsessive repetitive behaviours like picking or scratching at my skin for hours, pain or scabbing doesn't stop me. I often catch myself doing other repetitive behaviours that I don't notice starting(like rocking or petting my arm or leg). I get angry easily but always try to hide it so I end up taking it out on my self, physically. The worst one is that when I am incredibly upset, ( i feel like i should be embarrassed to say this) I hit myself... usually on the head. I like to think it is because I subconsciously do it so that I don't leave visible bruises. I also don't like it when people touch me or touching other people even if it's like someone lightly putting their hand on my arm for a brief moment during conversation. Almost every hug, besides from my direct family members and boyfriend, makes me very uncomfortable..and even them sometimes, to be honest.\n\n\nFights with people and things that should make me angry, frustrate me, and the only thing that stops my brain from spinning out is if I hurt myself.\n\n\nI thought I was just a weird person but lately I have been learning a bit about autism and it sounds like I have some symptoms. \n\n\nI am a functioning human being but every day feels like I am going against the current. Depression doesn't help, but even when in good spirits I find I just suck at life. I am ok with not having any friends to hang out with but I feel it is important to have friends and connections to be successful in life.\n\n\nI am wondering if it is worth it to seek diagnosis.
