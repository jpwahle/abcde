My life has been a crazy one.  Back in 2016 I was released from a mental hospital after years off mental health problems, Jail, I was homeless and I had an addiction to crack cocaine but have been clean from drugs and alcohol for nearly 3 years BUT I still smoke weed. It helped at first. It helped me relax and unwind and not think about things too much. I was in my own bubble to be honest.  I made some unreal progress in 2017, I packed my bags and went to Thailand on my own and my life was brilliant and got a taste of what life could be like, but then I got home and life started to decline from here. My social anxiety has got really bad and the past year I haven't left my house hardly, I haven't been to my local shop in a year, I stopped going to the gym, I have ruined friendships because I won't even answer my phone, I all of a sudden care too much what people think of me, Paranoid, panic attacks and I have ruined a potential relationship with a girl I liked because I kept putting off going on a date with her because my social anxiety got so bad. All I will do is sit in my house alone and smoke joint after joint after joint. While I am stoned I imagine my life without weed and it feels so fucking good and I know that my weed habit has got out of control. I have recently started an online business which has the potential to change my life but WEED has been the number 1 focus. I tell myself I am quitting every night before sleep and I believe myself, but as soon as I rise I smoke a joint and I get numbed from the world and my emotions and I hate myself most days. I have tried quitting many times but never get past the 7 full days mark. Recently I have kicked myself up the arse and started making small changes each day. I started NoFap last Saturday and each day I have been waking up slightly earlier (still 1pm tho which is bad) and have been doing small runs down my mothers house and back and also started having a smoothie (just the past 3 days). I quit weed on Thursday and I have been smoking CBD Flower to try and help my cravings but I'm having the worst time ever (worse than the last times I've tried). I just sit and get irritated and angry, no motivation, days drag by, I cry and sob like a baby when it gets to a night time, no sleep hardly and I keep getting suicidal thoughts. Today has been the hardest day\/night. I messaged my brother (my dealer as I live in UK) today and asked for just 0.5g but he had ran out until tomorrow. I am kinda happy that he had non because I know I would feel so bad. Basically I joined this group tonight (00:40) because I am struggling and need some help, desperately. If I go back to my old ways I won't live till the end of the year. My life is a mess even tho I have a great opportunity with my business but I'm struggling to see the light and itching for a smoke of THC. I'm worried about myself because suicidal thoughts are getting worse and all my emotions are so heavy on my shoulders. Sorry for the long message and if you have read this far, Thank you. Can someone please shine some light on my situation and if anyone knows how I feel just leave a comment because it will mean the world to me....

Everybody in the party was over the age of 18, i was the only minor there. My brother knew people there and they told me that for the entire night that I was at the party they considered me 18. So anyways, as time went on I saw that there were alcohol beverages in the kitchen and I just got really curious and poured a cup for myself but I poured it out because I got nervous and felt bad since my mom trusted me. I just wanted to experience some things.\nI did eventually get contact high since a good amount of people there were smoking weed.

I don't have a good relationship with food, and J has known this from the beginning. I used to come over to him and his parents house and would have full blown panic attacks over not being able to finish what small amount of food I would let myself take. Growing up it was always an effed up combination of, \"you always waste so much food!\" Even if I only had three bites left, and \"only take a little bit!\" To make sure there was enough for my two brothers and my parents. When I first started being friends with J he wouldn't push it too much. He'd just encourage me to snack on a bag of chips if a full plate of food felt too overwhelming. \n\nAfter almost an entire year of his Mom cooking, feeding, not criticizing my choices or guilting me about all this the anxiety started to get better. I stopped feeling guilty over a few leftover bites, or getting a second helping of something. But the second I get back home it starts all over. I can't cook for myself at home because if the kitchen isn't cleaned to perfection after I get yelled at, but I can't eat food out either because then I'm just wasting money when we have \"perfectly good food you could cook here!\" Then, factor in half the time the food I decide to cook was, \"going to be used for dinner and I should have known better\" and the fact that most mornings I get up at 4:20 for work, and God forbid I make noise! I only realized a month ago that the reason I have a problem even remembering to drink water half the time is because my Dad will yell at us for daring to leave our water glasses everywhere, so if we don't finish it right away we have to dump it down the sink. \n\nRight now, I am sitting on my bed too afraid to go downstairs to bring up a snack. Half the time I just go to bed hungry if dinner didn't fill me up, sometimes I just don't bother eating at all. I hate being so anxious about this, and I don't know how to make it stop. I spent $9 on some fried mushrooms and a coke earlier (we were on our own for dinner at a festival while my Grandma is in town) and now I'm trying not to cry because I just wasted so much money on something that didn't fill me up for long, and I feel guilty that I spent money period because I should have just eaten at home even though...well. see the argument above. It's a cycle that I feel trapped in, and even if I have the money for something I still ask J for permission to spend it because if he says it's ok the anxiety dissipates. He's super patient about it, and he keeps reassuring me I'll get there and it will get easier but I'm having a really hard time tonight...\n\nWhenever I do go out to eat or make myself food, or get something while I work, I almost always go for the high calorie foods because I want to make sure it will fill me up. I'm always afraid I'm going to get shaky hungry later in the day (especially if I'm working), and I know it's not always the healthiest thing. I'm maintaining my weight thankfully, but that's partially thanks to fizzy drinks. If I go for more than a week without pop I start to lose a few pounds and I hate it. I'm a healthy weight for the first time in my life (since J's mom started feeding me three years ago) and I want it to stay that way, but I know I don't have a good relationship with food at all. It gets better eventually right...?

I'm 24, still live with my parents, in the USA, work part-time and am looking to move out. My home situation is fine but I would like my own space. My parents aren't being pushy at all, they WANT me to stay, but I would like to be on my own with my dog sometime soon. I save whenever I can and pay for my own gas, car insurance, groceries, vet visits, etc. I live pretty simply and, because of my dog, want to own a house with a yard. I have 25k saved and know realistically that I need a full-time job or something with benefits before becoming a homeowner. (Also live in a state with one of the lowest costs of living and also have good credit score, so I'm not too worried about being able to find a house or be approved in the future). \n\nHere's the thing: I was diagnosed with MDD in 2014, was in therapy for about three years, took medication, all of it. I was hospitalized twice for suicide attempts. I currently no longer see my therapist or take medication because I was doing \"alright\" for awhile, but I'm scared to make any big changes. I'm just drifting along life right now. I think I mostly need to be re-diagnosed, as I've been thinking for a few years I have an undiagnosed mood or personality disorder. A lot of it is I can be okay for a few days, then be extremely moody and irritated. It used to be out of control and I would feel so many things change within a day, which I thought may have been rapid-cycling BPD or Bipolar. \n\nI guess I'm just terrified to confide in my parents and talk about this with them, since I'm under their insurance (United Healthcare), and they would probably have to know at least if I'm seeing a new psychiatrist? No one knows anything is up, I'm surviving, but only doing that. Not thriving if that makes sense. I want to possibly apply for SSI\/SSDI though I'm scared what my parents will think, since I technically am \"functional\", maybe high-functioning depression. It's not that I can't hold down a job but the previous retail job I had for 3 years was almost full-time, very demanding and I lost myself in it. I know better about self-care now but there's still a fear. I was working myself too hard until I became an anxious mess and went from being out on the sales floor chatting it up with customers to being unable to hold a conversation.\n\nI actually enjoy working, keeping myself busy with projects, I just get worn out easily. I'm scared that I will deal with anxiety and hit rock bottom again. I do know better ways to cope now and am constantly searching for full-time jobs, most of them are customer service related. I also pet sit on the side which is money under the table, obviously not enough to live on, though it is the only job I don't feel stressed about because I'm good with animals and know what to do in certain situations. \n\nI've looked up similar questions\/situations on reddit but am getting stressed because there is so much info out there. So please forgive me as I know I need to do more research, I just need to vent and maybe be given some hope or advice, not necessary though.\n\nThank you for reading &lt;3","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"depression","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqqf","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/depression","subreddit_subscribers":619929,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Scared to work full-time, how will I support myself, etc","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/depression\/comments\/cy3cs9\/scared_to_work_fulltime_how_will_i_support_myself\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

They were friends that my older brother met through online gaming. My brother wanted me to learn and practice English (we lived in Europe at the time, and later moved to Canada) so he let me use his Yahoo messenger to chat with people when he wasn't using the PC. \n\nThis is how I met whom I'll be calling B, who at the time was 24M. I also met R and A, both of whom were 19F. They were all from the Philippines and were very good friends with one another. They all met through the same game where they met my brother. They didn't hang out in person, because they lived in different corners of the Philippines. \n\nThey took a liking to me, and introduced me to online gaming. When my parents installed a webcam on their PC, we all started video calling and playing MMOs a few times a week. Some of my favorite childhood memories are from this time. R introduced me to shoujo manga, A liked to teach me about makeup, and B taught me proper English grammar. At the time, and for many years to come, I was severely bullied in school. I'm talking the kind of shit that you see in movies; beat up, locked in janitor closets overnight, dirty bucket water thrown over my head in bathroom stalls, you name it. This caused me to be incredibly socially retreated, and this group of friends got me through that time. They introduced me to a bunch of hobbies that I could do at home by myself or with online friends.\n\nThey liked to call me their little sister, and we all remained very good friends over the years. As I grew up, I became someone they could turn to for advice when their life took a wrong turn, and the same went for me. We were there for each other through heartbreaks, failures and successes. I genuinely considered them family.\n\nWell, recently something happened that has shattered all of that.\n\nB was a teacher when I met him when he was 24, and he is a teacher now at 39. I'm 22 now, R and A are in their early 30s. \n\nFor about a year now, B just sort of disappeared. I mean, not completely, but he would very rarely log on Facebook and chat for a bit. He was always really vague with his answers when I asked about his life, saying only things like \"Well...trials and tribulations happen...but I know that with faith God will always get us through\" (we're all Christian.) I couldn't get more than that out of him, so I just accepted that he'll eventually tell me what's been going on with his life. \n\nNow, R and A said things which indicated to me that they knew what was going on with B, but they were also always really vague about it with me. \n\nWell, one day R finally cracked. She told me that she just HAS to vent about something. \n\nSo as it turns out, B was caught being in a relationship with a 13 year old female student of his. He didn't go to jail, he simply lost his job and got shit from her parents. For the past year he had been struggling to find a job again, and finally, that day, he let R and A know that he had. \n\nThis...........to say that it shocked me is an understatement. I honestly thought it was some sort of language barrier or miscommunication, because the way that R and A spoke about it was so......casual. \n\nThe kicker is that the reason R told me all of this wasn't because she was horrified at the actions of B. No, it was because R and A got in a fucking catfight with the little girl and wanted to vent to me about her attitude.\n\nSo I confronted B the next time that he was online, and this is the story he gave me: \n\nThis 13 year old girl, let's call her Stacy, was B's student. B had an open door policy for his students to be able to go to his classroom and vent or talk at any time. Stacy was one such student. \n\nStacy had some problems at home and struggled with depression and anxiety because of it. She often confided in B about it, and eventually fell in love with him. She asked B to take care of her, and B agreed, and so they started a secret relationship. B claims that nothing sexual happened, and that they just liked to spend time with one another and hold hands or whatever, and planned to stay this way until she turned 18. \n\nHowever, because she's a fucking 13 YEAR OLD GIRL, Stacy couldn't help but brag to her friends about this \"relationship.\" B got in trouble, got fired, but wanted to stay together with Stacy. However, Stacy \"became too toxic and jealous\", and would message random girls in B's friends list (including R and A) to start fights and tell them to stop talking to B. Eventually, Stacy wanted to break up, much to the dismay of B, and that's how everything came to an end. Stacy was taken out of school and homeschooled from that point forward, and B had been struggling to get another job as a teacher. \n\nWhat was really disturbing though, was the way that B, R and A all talked about this incident. Clearly, they all knew it was wrong, because they were all reluctant to tell me about it. And yet, they all spoke about this whole thing as if B's relationship with Stacy was legitimate. As if Stacy was crazy and untrustworthy, and as if she ruined her relationship with B, didn't want to fight for their relationship, stabbed him in the back and ruined his life. \n\nThere was no remorse from B about what he did. The only mistake he admitted to was \"being stupid and dating a student.\" But the way that he said it was almost like it was on par with dating a co-worker. As if the mistake was that she was a student, not that she was a literal actual child. \n\nEveryone has since just kind of moved on from this. It's been about a week since I found this out, and they're all messaging me like nothing's wrong, and celebrating B's new job. \n\nI'm left confused, angry, disgusted and overwhelmed. All of my memories with B are now tainted. I'm left wondering if he ever thought of me in that way as I was growing up. I'm left disgusted by R and A, who fought with this traumatized and groomed child as if she was a grown, consenting adult, instead of calling the police. I just don't understand what is happening.\n\nWhat's worse is that, when they all first told me about it, I almost let it go. They kind of convinced me that B just truly and genuinely cared about this girl, that nothing sexual happened, that it was a one off thing, that in their culture It's normal for an older guy to take care of a younger girl and date her and that that's why he didn't get into any legal trouble. They kept spinning things around until it sounded normal and not so bad anymore. I thought back at how B never said anything even remotely romantic to me growing up, and thought \"it must have really been just a mistake, and It's not like they had sex or anything.\"\n\nBut no, it IS bad, right? Like, this is really fucked up isn't it? B GROOMED this child, and R and A were complicit. Point blank, B is a pedophile, and R and A enabled him. \n\nI want to cut off all contact with these people. But It's hard, these people got me through the darkest chapter of my life. I seriously see them as family. I even thought, like, family sticks together even through the worst of mistakes, and will help their loved ones get back on the right track and become better. This train of thought almost made me feel like I would be abandoning B by dropping him after he fucked up. \n\nBut I just can't do this, I can't see any of them the same way anymore. This has really fucked me up, and I guess I just need some reassurance that I'm doing the right thing by cutting them all off, including R and A. \n\nI wish I knew who this girl was so that I could check up on her and make sure she gets the help she needs. \n\nLet me know what you think Reddit. I'd really appreciate some insight. \n\nTL;DR My male adult friend was in a relationship with a 13 year old girl, and our friend group sees nothing wrong with it.

This was my first pregnancy.\n\nAugust 22, 2019\n\nI feel further and further away from Madelin every day.  I don\u2019t know if I can do this.  I don\u2019t know if I will survive this.  Do I want to survive this?  Everything hurts.  I\u2019m on an island of grief and if I even try to swim I will drown.\n\nIt started 2 weeks ago.  At work around 8 AM I started feeling an immense pressure like a horrible cramp.  I was supremely stupid and reasoned that I must have to poop.  I felt super nauseated and got chills eventually which led me to believe that I was wrong.  I started having blinding pain.  I called my sister and she told me to see my OB immediately.  They made an appointment for 9:15 am.  I felt like I was dying.  My coworker drove me over because I was in so much pain.  My other coworker later said I looked green and like a ghost.  When I got to the OB they sat me down at the ultrasound area.  I couldn\u2019t stop rubbing my legs because it hurt so bad that I had to move to distract myself.  After an excruciating 15+ minutes of waiting for my appointment they brought me in. I was bleeding a lot.  The ultrasound technician told me she was going to do an internal first.  Baby is fine.  She silently moves around in my stomach even though to me it feels like she is poking fire into my belly.  I meet with the OB and get sent over to the hospital triage.  I\u2019m still bleeding.  They check the baby\u2019s heartbeat every four hours and my vitals every 8.  I am visited by numerous people giving me worst case scenarios because it is their job but I still hate it.  I wonder now if I would have preferred it ending now instead of later.  I had to sign paperwork allowing surgery and was told that the pregnancy wasn\u2019t viable so all they could do was worry about me.  I wanted to scream at them and tell them to save my baby, not me.  We stayed overnight to watch me and baby Madelin.  During that time I was told I had, had a placental abruption with a tear of 3.5 inches.  Little did I know that this was the first death knoll of my baby.  She might as well have died then but I honestly would have taken the extra days with her.  By Wednesday morning I allowed to go home because I had stopped bleeding and baby\u2019s heartbeat was still 145 to 165 bpm.  I was told I was on super light duty and all I had to do was make it to September 18 to have a viable pregnancy.\n\nDuring this time I had also met with a high risk pregnancy doctor.  He told me if I bled again I would be at the hospital for a week and if I bled a third time I would be there until the baby was born.  God how I would have traded ANYTHING you could think of to have those weeks in bed rest as opposed to what happened.\n\nFriday through Sunday I had cramps because I was passing blood clots.  I wonder if even then my body was gearing up to betray me and shatter any hopes I had I\u2019d meeting and keeping my precious Madelin.  I did go in on Saturday because there was some red blood but we weren\u2019t there very long because they said it was all old blood.  When I was there they checked the baby\u2019s heartbeat and it was fine.  I don\u2019t know if it was a blessing or a curse that I never heard her heartbeat drop below 145 bpm.  She was always so strong.  But apparently my body was not.\n\nFast forward to Monday afternoon where I am having unbearable pains after trying to go to work.  I go back to the hospital even though I don\u2019t want to with every fiber of my being.  I already hated the place.  Little did I know that this would be the last time Madelin and I would be going together with her safely in my belly.  We get into the room and it takes a while of getting admitted but then I am told the worse news of my entire life.  I am 2 cm dilated and there is nothing that can stop it.  My baby was coming into a world she couldn\u2019t survive in.  My stupid, worthless body was ejecting precious cargo 5 weeks too soon and there was not a friggin thing modern medicine could do to stop it.  The doctor on call asks me if I want to induce labor or wait for it naturally.  Did I want to die from the inside out slowly or quickly?  I wanted whatever option that would keep me with my baby longer.  What I really wanted to go to a world where this wouldn\u2019t happen.  Instead I took a hard and arduous route without knowing it.  They check the baby\u2019s heart beat and she\u2019s still fine.  Still has a strong heartbeat. Like she was busy growing so she could see me and had no idea it was all about to end.  This was the last time i heard her heartbeat.  During this time I started grasping at life lines, texting everyone who mattered.  All my sisters ended up coming to be with me.   My husband was there but he was dealing with his own grief.  For me, I didn\u2019t have time to reflect or grieve.  The labor pains we\u2019re getting worse.  I had asked for an epidural but the anesthesiologist was in OR and didn\u2019t come in time even though I had asked two hours prior.  After an hour of excruciating pain, I am told to start pushing.  I don\u2019t want to.  I want to keep her safe.  She isn\u2019t ready for this world.  She needs to stay.  I wish she\u2019d stayed.  Instead I push and she eventually slides out with a part of that stupid betraying placenta.  I\u2019m asked if I want to see the baby.  She\u2019s still alive.  Of course she is.  She wants to stay and be with me.  I can\u2019t.  I can\u2019t.  If I see her I will break.  I will think of how she\u2019s a part of me and she can\u2019t be without me yet.  I don\u2019t see her then but my sister convinces me I should.  My husband and I hold her together and just weep.  If I had another chance I would tell her how much I love her.  How I\u2019m sorry she got the shitty chance of coming to a body that didn\u2019t deserve her and keep her safe.  About how If I could I would trade my life for her tiny one in a second.  Even now.  Even though it was too late.  She was out of her protective nest and already failing.  Leaving me empty.  She was born at 11:16 pm and died at 12:06 am.  \n\nMadelin left this world as quickly as she came into it.  I\u2019m broken and I don\u2019t know how to fit the pieces back together.  They won\u2019t.  How do I live each day without her.  I feel a stab of pain and a piece of me that falls away each day that passes.  I hate time.  I would freeze my moment in that terrible pain forever just to have her with me.  I only needed 5 more weeks.  Now all those milestones are gone.   All those baby appointments canceled.  I want to rage; I want to scream, but none of that will bring her back.  She\u2019s gone \u2014 gone forever and I\u2019m expected to keep on living this life without her.\n\nI got to hold her precious body one more time before she was cremated. It was good for the healing process just to hold her one more time and cry my heart out.

I've been in  bed for 10 hours, and there's been nothing on my mind but suicide. I'm so strangely calm about it - I think I finally feel comfortable with leaving. I don't want to call the suicide hotline because they called the police on me last time I did.\n\n Please, I need someone to read this.\n\nI am trying to end a 3 and a half year relationship and I am having so much anxiety and I'm having really, really morbid thoughts. Basically the first 2 years were good, I considered it just a normal teenage relationship. The last year and a half has been hectic. \n\nShe has Borderline Personality Disorder and it's completely ruined me physically and mentally. I've been isolated from my family and friends, I've been turned into her slave. I stopped working out, I have gained a little weight and don't recognize myself in the mirror; I'm lethargic and fatigued, constantly.\n\nShe started to be seriously abusive when I was maybe 18 and a half and she was 2 years older. She started to scream at me, call me names, hit me, etc. almost every day she would scream at me, or call me an asshole or a piece of shit. All the while she would make posts on Facebook and Twitter about me.\n\nI went to hang out with a friend who isn't friends with her (the first time I've done so in about a year) because she was going back to college and I wanted to see her, and my girlfriend flipped out. She has always been pathologically jealous, but this was next level. She screamed at me, demanded I give her my phone, and wouldn't listen to me when I described her and how long I've known her (4 years), her name, details of our friendship, and where my gf has seen her.\n\nShe continued being livid so I went to hang out with my friend. On my way there, she called me and told me she figured out who she was through a \"source\" and said the girl was popular and that we never talked, and I said there were other girls with that name at my high school, and this one was a nerd. I hung up and kept driving there. While there, she blew up my phone frantically, 20+ texts about \"YOU'RE PUTTING ANOTHER GIRL BEFORE ME!\" \"I'M HAVING A PANIC ATTACK AND YOU DON'T CARE!\" \"HOW'S YOUR DATE GOING?\" and it ruined my mood. \n\nWhile I was talking to my friend, one of my gf's friends showed up and sat right behind me. I found out that this was premeditated, and that she'd been texting my girlfriend while performing espionage. I also found out that she'd been messaging two of my friends (who i met before we started dating, but are now on \"her\" side, as I've deduced by the things they said about me), unloaded all my private business and personal details on them, and sent screenshots of the girl and her name, asking who she was. I've deduced that she messaged about half a dozen people trying to figure out who the girl was.\n\nI got home and she flipped out again. She started screaming at me again and I tried talking but she wouldn't calm down. I told her I wasn't going to have her scream at me all night and that I needed to go upstairs to help my dad with something before he went to bed (true) and I tried to leave my room. She started blocking my path and continued screaming and cussing at me. She wouldn't let me past for 15 minutes and kept telling me \"HIT ME! DO IT! DO IT!\". I kept calm and finally she let me through, after screaming in my face that she was leaving me, how she hates me, wants to kill herself because of me, etc. etc.\n\nAnyway she went somewhere for 2 days and came back and left a very unapologetic note on our computer, failing to acknowledge what she did and pinning the blame on me. I left one back, telling her we'd talk when she wouldn't scream at me. We talked and I told her we had to break up and she had a mental breakdown. She started begging, saying \"I DIDN'T MEAN IT!\" and that she \"was going to get help\", but was also talking about how she wants to kill herself, how she made her parents hate her, how she was an accident, etc.\n\nThis is hard on me for a lot of reasons...\n\n1. I'm completely mentally depleted. Like, I'm a shell of my former self. She abused and damaged me so much that I've completely lost contact with who I am. I'm part of her, I'm not part of this world anymore. I don't know that I will ever be the same again. I feel almost sociopathic at this point. I feel completely disconnected from everything around me.\n\n2. In practicality - she does not have a car or a home. She drives my spare car and lives in my house. She doesn't have finances - I fed her every day when she was in school (2 years). She has impulsive spending habits, but she does have a job (Hooters style restaurant). I am afraid that she will be resourceless and commit suicide.\n\n3. She was there for me when my mom passed away (3 and a half years ago) and we have an emotional connection because of that. She helped me and my family and was with me every day.\n\nI'm really, really hurting because I realized I'm 20 and the only person I've ever had a positive relationship with is gone. My best friend of 10 years tried to ruin my life after I started dating this girl, and she was similarly abusive - we stopped talking when my mom passed, and she decided to scream at me on the day of her funeral, and then not go to it. My dad didn't talk to me until after my mom passed away, he cheated on her, was never home, always screaming, saying fuck my life, etc. My mom spent the last 3 years of her life strung out on drugs, rarely ever able to drive or speak. My older brother beat me probably weekly for 8ish years, stopping after my mom passed. My first girlfriend told our school I raped her, resulting in me dropping out sophomore year and being hospitalized.\n\nI just feel like this is the end. I'm hopeless. I've always felt like reaching for something but at this point I don't want to go anywhere. I just... I don't want to keep going. Normally I'm sad, I'm wailing, but I'm just... empty. I feel completely comfortable in proceeding with this.\n\nI wasted my youth in a horribly abusive relationship, developed no skills, lost all my friends, and for the past 2 years have made no friends in college, and mt mental state has deteriorated. I have depression, anxiety, and PTSD, and have yet to have a strong positive relationship with anyone. \n\nTime just keeps ticking and I feel less and less connected with reality each day. There are no ups and downs - it's just a constant homeostasis. I wake up, and feel the same. Empty, devoid of feeling, or life. Waiting to fall asleep.\n\nI feel stone cold, I feel like a serial killer. I don't mean that literally, the only person I want to kill is myself. I mean that I don't feel human. I feel cold, empty, stale, bored, lifeless. Robotic.\n\nThere's not even hurt anymore... there's just nothing. I don't see anything when I look in the mirror.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SuicideWatch","subreddit_id":"t5_2qpzs","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/SuicideWatch","subreddit_subscribers":193078,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I really need anybody, just anybody to read this... please...

I gave up my career for my husband and I'm 8 months from finishing the program we thought would be best for me to switch to. This program cannot be paused or transferred: it's imperative that I complete it.\n\nMy program does not offer health insurance through school. As it is an intensive, full-time and accelerated course load, I can only work about 12 hours a week maximum, where I earn $11\/hr. Husband was supposed to support me through this time, but he put my life at risk and I was advised to leave immediately. He has declined my request (begging) to let me continue to see my doctor until I graduate in half a year. He is not responsible for any of my expenses-- He is military, so my health coverage does not cost him a penny. In fact, he benefits from staying married because he gets paid more. But he has filed for divorce because he doesn't me to have health insurance if I'm not going to be a \"happy, loving wife\" for him. \n\nI have a few health conditions-- a few of which are moderate irritations where medication\/treatment greatly improves my quality of life, but lack of treatment won't kill me. I also have a couple health conditions that may actually kill me without treatment.\n\nI've never had to shop for health insurance, and I don't know what to look for or where to go. Any option online requires proof of divorce before even giving me a quote, and that won't be finalized for about two months. I can take a loan as I have good credit. I'd prefer to pay slightly higher premiums if it has better coverage.\n\nAny tips, resources, or experiences?

I was venting on social media and a woman ( we will call her X) started striking conversations with me. At first I didn't know who she was because we talked the first few days on snapchat. Eventually she posted and I realized she was someone i went to highschool with.  I wasnt attracted to her but she wasn't bad looking either. (Im a sucker for a big butt). I was depressed and she stated she would be my friend. So we talked daily for a month or so. I made no advances. At some point she began to send me sexual pictures and videos an asked me to be her \"fake boyfriend\" which i internalized as she wants me to fuck her.. I hadn't had sex in a month so i was triggered by it all.  Eventually i went to her place and got everything she was offering me. At the time i asked her was she on birth control. she said yes. I proceeded to sleep with her thinking there was nothing to worry about. ( she was also pressing about us drinking and smoking) even tho i'd quit both.   I'm 30 and have no children. The next day, I asked her again about the birth control just in case, i could run and grab a plan B. Shestated she was good and had an app that tracks everything and nothing to worry about. I slept with her maybe twice more. after that , me and my girlfriend got back together. X knew me and her were literally nothing but she tried to maintain a friendship via texts and phone calls. I was not interested. I'd gotten what i came for and was back being happy with my gf. A month or so goes by and X has been texting me she isn't feeling well or whatever. I figured it was her job stressing her, until one night she wrote a long msg saying she needed to speak with me.  she claimed she bought 2 pregnancy tests and they both were positive. She didn't seem upset. I was fucked up over the news. she kept saying \"I'm just worried about you. this isn't a big deal to me.\" she already has 3 children. I felt destroyed, defeated, depressed, angry, frustrated, tricked, and confused.\n\nShe doesn't believe in abortions and is living her life completely care free while i had to tell my girlfriend about my horrible mistake. completely ruined out happy streak :( I feel trapped. I hate her. At this point I've accepted it (though,  i have a last bit of hope once we get a paternity test). She claims I'm the only person shes been with and the timing matches up perfectly. I hope she is lying but im fairly sure she isn't. She has sent me ultra sounds. As a last resort, i offered her 1000 dollars for an abortion (which i dnt believe in myself but this shows how desperate i'd become) She proceeded to argue with me saying I cant tell her what to do with her body. At that moment i said fuck it due to my rage and i didnt have the energy to argue with some Bword about women's rights. I told her call me if she needs pampers and have not spoken to her since.. In the midst of the news an what not, she claims she didn't tell the doctors its mine and that she doesn't need anything from me. yeah right. she's lied about a few things at this point.\n\nI find my self hoping she or the baby dies. I know I'm wrong but i am selfish and always have been which is why ive taken so many drastic measures not to have children up until now. I was an expert at pulling out, using condoms, and buying plan B since i was a teen. Until now. I let my low point get the best of me and allowed the bword to seduce me and escape with my seed. I hate her and myself and i refuse to co parent. I will pay child support at the most. but i want the child to suffer for her mothers evil actions. I want nothing to do with either.  I've watched friends and family go through the ups and downs of having kids and i don't want any part. Her kid not having a father is the only way I can repay her for ruining my life with her bastard child I never wanted. Yeah, I know i'm a pretty mean person. I never claimed to be a good guy. My relationship is now shit with my gf who fights with me daily. i literally hate women at this point. i bet i wont nut in another woman ever again. lying ass weird ass bword !","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"offmychest","subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/offmychest","subreddit_subscribers":1898949,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"i have a child on the way i want nothing to do with","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/offmychest\/comments\/cy3l9a\/i_have_a_child_on_the_way_i_want_nothing_to_do\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

(6\/15 of my chicken wings were RAW in the middle, fair enough to ask for a refund right?)\n\nHowever, for some reason, I could order still and I did. I ordered $19.40 worth of food a few nights later, but my girlfriend wanted to eat out instead so I cancelled the order and got it refunded in Skip Credits because I figured we could use them another time.\n\nHere's the kicker. I guess the system was like lagging and decided to fully blacklist me today. I tried to order $19.40 worth of food from about 8 restaurants, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM came out as \"Your order has been rejected.\"\n\nWhen I contacted support, they told me to e-mail them instead, so ok, I did. I have to give them props, they do respond to E-mails at a decently fast rate (about 10 minutes per response), but they're the type of business to take one step forward and two steps back. I'll explain. The response I got basically said they have no way of refunding my money, and that my account is blacklisted so I can't order anymore either. **WTF** RIGHT?\n\nThis mean the $19.40 on my account is just going to sit there **forever**. I sent about 8 E-mails with screenshots of the receipt from the order, and how it says it was an interac e-transfer, and I kept asking why it's so hard to just refund an e-transfer. However, to my disbelief, the person kept saying they have no way of refunding my money and that they cannot process anymore orders from my account.\n\nThis is straight up stealing. I'm SURE there's a way to refund an order, especially when I have the order #, the transaction #, the date and time it was placed, and the exact amount. Not to mention, THEY have all this info too. I literally have to log in to THEIR site and click my receipt tab to even check.\n\nI'm a student, by the way, so I'm really tight on money and ordering food is a luxury for me. Although, I don't think you need to be in college to relate. It's like if someone stole a 20 from you and superglued it to some metal and welded that metal to a titanium pillar. You can never get it back, but you can definitely look at it whenever you want lmao.\n\nThis post got way longer than I thought it would, but I just needed to get this off my chest. This is also a warning for those who use this app to proceed with caution. I got blacklisted for getting delivered cold, raw chicken wings and then had my money held hostage as a result. Beware.\n\nEdit: Because it was an E-Transfer, there isn't a whole lot my bank can do. Picture you took out 20 from your bank account, went to do a deal on Kijiji, you give the seller the money, and they zoom off. You can't tell your bank to reimburse you for the 20 that you lost on your own. Appreciate the suggestions though.\n\nEdit 2: Leave Goldenhorseshoe alone, he\/she is obviously young and doesn't know how the world works. Ignore the young one and move on. Ironically, I'm 20 and saying this but hey no one's perfect.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"skipthedishes","subreddit_id":"t5_3grye","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/skipthedishes","subreddit_subscribers":1606,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Skip is holding my money hostage","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/skipthedishes\/comments\/cy3qtj\/skip_is_holding_my_money_hostage\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I've wasted the last 5 years of my life. I've spent 4 of those years at a 2 year college and I have yet to get a single job. I'm 23 years old. I've been living with my mom and aunt and my aunt is giving me an ultimatum. Either move with the family to Texas next year or stay in NYC. I want to stay. I've spent my whole life here and I don't want to leave it behind. And I would be able to stay if I got a job back when I graduated highschool. But no. ANYTIME I had thoughts about being productive and trying to improve my life my subconscious mind shut those thoughts down and came up with excuses. I'd suddenly be hungry or tired, or some some old or new videogame would suddenly seem so interesting that I just HAD to play it. And even when I could get through these temptations and actually think about doing things, I wouldn't. I would just sit there and wait till something came up that would cause to me forget.\n\nBut the last few months have been a bit better. I've been taking daily walks to and from a dog park near me. I don't bring my own, cuase he's aggressive to other dogs, but I pet and play with other dogs. These walks also serves as a bit of exercise. I've been slowly improving my diet and I recently started doing Intermittent fasting(thanks [r\/intermittentfasting](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/intermittentfasting\/) for teaching me how to). I've lost 10 pounds so far. It's been harrowing but I've also applied to a few jobs. I've been to one interview and I highly doubt ill get it(for good reasons though). \n\nMy associates degree is in reach but it might be close. Due to financial problems I didn't think i'd be able to attend this semester but that's changed. With luck I'll finish in the spring semester. Or maybe even winter semester if I think I can handle it.\n\nBut Despite these steps I've taken I feel like its pointless. I doubt I'll be able to save up enough money, If I even get a job, to stay in NYC. In Texas everything is going to be so far away. Work is going to be extremely hard to find, and no school will want a failure of a student. And all the friends I've known since elementary will be almost completely out of touch since I somewhat rarely see them in person anymore and their pretty much never online anymore. At least not to play.\n\nAnd that's my current situation. I'm constantly thinking about how much of my life I've wasted. I know it'll get better.

So, to put it blunt, my love life has honestly been the most pathetic about myself. I'm just so sick of it all. I attribute my lack of good looks to the failure of my love life (as well as sheer bad luck! More info on that below..).\n\nA little about me is I'm 19 M (straight) in college -- starting my sophomore year since just a week ago. Appearance-wise, I'm probably a 6-7\/10 on average. I have a dad-bod but I honestly don't think I look that egregious! I have been hitting the gym 3-4 times a week for the last 2 years. And I mean that. Working out is the only thing that gives me gratification. I have really been working on my physique\/weight so that I can build up some confidence. I also tend to have higher standards when it comes to looking for love. Am I bad for having such standards? \n\nAside from that personal junk -- I'm really stuck now. There was a girl I liked in my psych class &gt; figured out later she has a husband. I started liking this one other girl after that happened and today I learned that she has a boyfriend. This has been happening for the entirety of my love life: Finding people with significant others. Its REALLY demotivating. And now I'm starting to think I've had enough.\n\nI've heard all my life that you should just \"live your life and the 'one' will come to you.\" Yeah well when I abide by that idea, I feel lazy and like I should be working for love, not sitting back and letting it happen. Am I wrong? Should I just be focusing on me?\n\nIts extremely difficult for me to just focus on myself... I swear my hormones have been spiking recently too -- I'm in college. I'm partying. I'm meeting new people all the time, and I can never stop thinking about finding a nice girl to get with. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Is it obvious to you? I just want to live my life and experience some quality relationships before I'm fucking dead. It just doesn't happen though. \n\nI appreciate you taking the time to read my life's troubles.. \n\n**TLDR;** \n\nI attribute not being able to find anyone because of my looks or because of my standards.

I'd just stay by myself in a corner. I don't remember life before 5 years old as much, but I remember some parts of this accordingly as my parents described. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen in kindergarten, when kids were at least old enough to talk somewhat properly and know better, it didn't go too well. I used to pee my pants almost daily because I was too scared to ask to go to the bathroom; and whenever I did get permission to go to the bathroom, I kept going every 5 minutes to the point where I wouldn't get my school work done. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was one boy I liked because he was small and cute, and I wanted to be his friend badly for some reason, and I thought copying everything he did would make him like me. He'd say something, I'd repeat it. He'd do something on the playground, I'd do it. He got pissed off and wasn't at all interested in being my friend, but I didn't realize till way later on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also become obsessed with certain things. Like for about a solid year, all I wanted to talk about were Teletubbies. Whenever I had to draw something for an assignment, I drew Teletubbies. And then my obsession became dinosaurs. And so on and so forth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other kids noticed I was different and somewhat singled me out. Like at this big long table at lunch where the boys sat on one side of it and the girls on the other, neither wanted me on their side. The boys were like, \"(my name)! Go sit with the girls! I'll give you candy! Dinosaur candy!\" And then the girls were like, \"No! You come to the girl's side and we'll beat you up!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt also seemed as whenever I tried to begin a conversation with someone, I made them upset in some sort of way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also had some weird habits. Like whenever my class was set free for physical education along with people from other classes, I'd just follow a small group of kids from our class so I didn't \"get lost.\" To the point where they noticed and said, \"Stop following us!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd over time, building up to my teen years, I've always been a sort of quiet and awkward kid. I didn't like arousing negative emotions in others, which I seemed to do every time I talked, so I tried less. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually though I was being too quiet and pushing everyone away. To the point where I'd talk so little I'd often forget to say hi back to people who greeted me, or I'd forget to say thank you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese days, I'm the best version of myself socially I guess. I don't usually talk to new people unless they talk to me first, but I can somewhat get a conversation rolling, I ask them questions, they ask me questions, we have a good time. I've been able to build a few close friendships. I feel comfortable around people who are already friends with me at least. I can tell when a person is irritated or might not wanna talk or whatever. I can pick up ques. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSocial interactions though, take a lot out of me, and I just wanna chill with some TV and video games after school. It's why I never joined a club, or got a job, or began community service. The school day itself already drains me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it matters, I'm 18 years old and in my senior year\/12th grade.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"autism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhs6","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/autism","subreddit_subscribers":67081,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Am I most likely autistic?","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/autism\/comments\/cy3vpw\/am_i_most_likely_autistic\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

I'm 16 and on the smaller side, so I fairly often fit 10-12 size shirts. It was only when I got home and tried on all of these clothes did I get to the two tank tops: a green one from the boys' section and a yellow one from the girls'. \n\nUpon trying on the girls' tank top, I noticed it fits about as expected and still finds my curves in the way that clothing geared towards female-bodied people does. The green tank has a different neckline and slightly different cut that I could notice and I preferred how that one fit, which makes me wonder if it's just the idea that it is supposed to be a masculine piece of clothing that intrigues me or if I genuinely thought it looks better on me. I feel like it's a combination of both. Anyway, I bound my chest and put the green tank top back on, and that shirt made me feel more comfortable and more confident than any other article of clothing I purchased today.\n\nThis brings me back to a certain dilemma. I sometimes wonder why it is this cheap green tank from the boys' section could make me feel more like myself and more confident than my very favorite pair of heels: a pair of burgundy combat boots that I love to bits. I loved them from the first time I ever laid eyes on them on a thrift shop rack, and I immediately knew that I needed those shoes to be mine, and not only are they very comfortable, but as a concept, I am in love with these shoes. When I put them on, for a moment it really does feel like I look good and I _feel_ good when I'm walking in them, but those heels never made me feel as confident as putting on that green tank top today. It makes me wonder if I feel more genuinely confident in masculinity because I have some preconceived notion of what femininity is or should be.\n\nI've been dressing particularly fem lately, trying to dress in the ways I think I would like to, but on that note I tend to only feel confident in being feminine when I dissociate myself from it. I only really feel pretty if I sort of pretend the person in the mirror is some other person \u2014 some other girl \u2014 and perhaps that is why I tend to stray away from my face when taking pictures of myself and viewing myself because it is easier to picture that I'm someone else who _is_ very confident and self-assured and feels as if this is the right role for them. And this works decently well when I'm in the right frame of mind, which, as it stands, I am, but it doesn't feel as natural and it does oftentimes feel somewhat rehearsed. Even on its best days, it never truly feels like me and still causes me to pause and think through my life through the lens of, \u201cIs this I want to be and present myself as?\u201d \n\nSo then that brings me to the question of am I looking for some kind of escape from what I believe society would expect from me as a girl or a woman, or am I genuinely just more content in gender nonconformity for my own personal reasons that there is no great amount of depth to? Why is it that I prefer the green tank top aside from just I like the way it fits me? \n\nI may never truly get the answer to this question that I would like to, and I wouldn't say I've _accepted_ that, but I would say that I don't believe I have the energy at this point in time to devote to giving this more thought because I have spent _so_ many hours thinking about this in my life and what it is going to turn out like and if I am wasting my time. If I'll somehow be hurting myself and\/or other people by somehow choosing to present between lines. If it's some manifestation of self-hatred, despite me not believing that to be the case knowing what my self-esteem in currently like. If I am a liar for saying that I genuinely wish at times to just not have to be a girl, and not necessarily because I am expected to be a girl, but because when I look in the mirror, it's not me that I am staring at but rather a female shell that I've been given.\n\nThis is a far longer post than I intended it to be, but here we are. At least I can say that I've gotten all of my thoughts out of my head, so perhaps I will be able to sleep okay tonight, but that might be too much to expect.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"NonBinary","subreddit_id":"t5_2vcez","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/NonBinary","subreddit_subscribers":46356,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Do I prefer masculinity because I have problems with expections of feminity, or is it really not that deep?","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/NonBinary\/comments\/cy3xgz\/do_i_prefer_masculinity_because_i_have_problems\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

still debilitating, luckily I do have friends, however it's only because i wear a mask 100% of the time, I so desperately want a relationship, but many of my issues stand in the way, my anxiety, my social awkwardness, etc. I am so afraid that all I'm going to do is either embarrass myself or her with one of my fucked up traits, I play bass but I'm awful because of my coordination, I used to play competitive video games, but I just gave up on it since I'm awful at them, and some of my traits were showing through when I would play them with friends and I don't want them to think of me as \"the autistic kid\" I'm 17 and I've tried to take my own life multiple times, can't discuss it with a therapist due to anxious thoughts of being sectioned, I am a little better now with dealing with my emotions but, I still carry an insane amount of guilt that anyone who's an NT just wouldn't, every little awkward social interaction sits on my shoulders for months or even years, every shit memory from my childhood, I don't understand how anyone can see the positive in this, yes some aspies are very gifted, however I am not one of them, I barley have an education, I'm currently going into my second year of college, at a different college, since my attendance was so poor at my last one they wouldn't let me on the next year of the course I was doing, they even tried to make it out like I was an NT, regardless of the messages from my counselor who tried to explain my barrage of symptoms and the fact they all contributed to my attendance, oh and my attendance was around 87% so yeah, my life is pretty fucking great, I smoke, i binge drink, i used to smoke about an ounce of weed a week, I'm poor since my mam is on basic benefits, she would work if I wasn't how I am, I hate it so much, i just drag everyone around me down with me, I just want to badly to be normal, not to have stupid obsessions, not to have the anxiety weighing me down, the issues with food, my life is a pretty steep slope to an early grave and a loveless trip down there, the only time I'm happy is when I'm on some different substance, as long as I'm not in my own mind, I'm happy, before anyone tries to say it, my counselor won't prescribe me any antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or anything else along those lines, the most they've ever prescribed me is circadin (melatonin supplements) and that was only for a short period of time, and I had to go to my GP to get the only drug that's even remotely close to an anti anxiety drug, propranolol, and it's not that good as an anti anxiety drug, every day is torture to me, I don't mind noises, I don't have meltdowns, I hide everything about me, literally 1 of my friends actually knows that I'm an aspie, and that's only because I told him while I was drunk, I just wanna be a normal teenager, have sex, go to parties, have a disposable income, and to actually enjoy life even a little, I've probably massively exaggerated everything in this post but I hope someone out there can relate to how shit I feel all the time. \n\n\nTL:DR aspergers is the worst thing I can imagine,  wouldn't wish it on my worst

My friends who knew me in my pre-transiton days have sometimes joked that I had a great female body to be stuck as a man in - Most people would never in a million years guess I transitioned. I'm 5'11 with a full beard now, and I was broad shouldered, narrow hipped, and (almost) flat chested even before I started hormones 8 years ago. All in all, I'm lucky to be where I'm at, and most of the time it's just medical history at this point.\n\nBut I will say the most ongoing source of stress about it in recent years has been the sense of disdain I've felt from other gay men. I'm in my late 20's, settled into my career and finally making good money, and I feel ready to find a partner to build a life with. One of the last hurdles I've been trying to get over is working up the courage to start being a more active participant when I'm approaching someone I'm interested in. I know I have a lot to offer a partner, and I can't live my whole life acting like I'm inherently going to be a burden to every gay man who has a crisis because he thinks I'm hot.\n\nThe story's not all that different. Gay men all generally have the 'hurdle' to get over when they're looking for a partner. If you're not quite literally sitting in a gay bar, you end up sending out metaphorical smoke signals trying to figure out if that guy you're interested is also into men, and also additionally into you specifically, all before you even know if you're compatible in other ways. For me, I have an entire extra hurdle where I have to disclose I'm trans, and historically, gay men have been the shittiest to me about it, even worse than the reaction I'd received from some conservatives and religious folks. From guys coming on hot (*them* onto *me*, mind you) suddenly going real cold and even bitchy, to getting immediately blocked after disclosure, to the rude, stupid, and invasive questions about my genitals, to even the condescending compliments, to the out-and-out fetishists, I won't say it hasn't been disheartening.\n\nI've dated mostly bisexual men. I think part of the reason is because knowing he was bi made that last hurdle not feel so insurmountable. For the record: I love bisexual men. Each of my bi partners knew I was a man and didn't ever put an asterisk on it. My future partner may very well one day be a bisexual man and it wouldn't change a thing - but I'll say that the overall trend of it is something that bothered me. Like I was limited to this one specific group of people. For the first time in my life a few months ago I dated a man who was gay, and while it didn't work out with him (for reasons not related to me being trans), I was surprised at how much relief I was experiencing knowing that I was dating someone who exclusively found men hot, and that he found *me* hot. It made me realize that my dating pool was so small as it was, I really shouldn't be artificially limiting it by making a guy's decision about me on his behalf.\n\nSo now that I've accidentally told my life story on here, I think I'm just looking for some solidarity. I'd love to hear some stories from cis gay men who have trans men as partners. Gay men who love trans men - When did you realize your sexuality had that dimension to it? Did you always feel this way, or is it an attraction you learned about yourself? Were there any preconceived notions about trans men you ended up shedding? Has anyone ever questioned\/challenged your sexuality for it? \n\nTo the gay men who wouldn't date trans men: That's fine, but the question I'm asking isn't directed at you and I promise you that I already know all of your reasons. You're free to go back to blocking me on Grindr.

First my haiku: \n\nCats give me cuddles\n\nLittle cute fluff balls of fur\n\nBest nap time buddies\n\n\nI have been having a lot of fights lately with my mom who I suspect has BPD, I've read How to survive a borderline parent and she seems to fit, as well my therapist feels BPD is likely. I've been trying to set things up to move out. I graduated in May from university and have a full time job. A friend of mine decided to rent out the top part of her house as a separate furnished apartment at a good price. My mom found out and has raged at me since telling me that if I move out it will end the relationship between her and I.\n\nI'm looking for some advice\/courage on moving out of the home. I'm 21, soon 22, and have just started therapy a few months ago to acknowledge the abuse that had been ongoing since I was a child from my mom. I always accepted everything as normal but I've come to realize emotional and verbal abuse had been present through my life. Now that I am more aware I have been coming more to the conclusion I need to move out and get away from the stress at home and the control and manipulation she tries to use against me. She has been fighting with me over spending time with other people more than her, claiming I must 'hate' her and hate spending time with her and that these friends I have are 'stealing' her daughter away from her. She uses every guilt tactic against me and now it's at the point she threatens me that she will never speak to me again and have no relationship if I move out or do certain things, but also says it's all my fault why we won't have a relationship and that it's me who hates her and will cut her off. \n\nAnyone have a similar experience moving out from home or advice?

Kind of long post so my bad but I need to rant. \n\nSo me and my gf have been together since we were 16 and 18, and I've been drinking very sporadically since I was about 16. My family is pretty lenient and more of a 'I'll let you mess up so you can learn and then help clean up the mess' style parenting, and they never had any problems if I'd have a few drinks here and there at family events. Since my gf and I have been together she's made it clear how she felt about drinking (not an age thing- her whole family is adamantly against drinking in any way) and for the most part there weren't many issues. She never asked me not to drink. However, as we stayed together longer and I got older, we'd argue over drinking and I always maintained the argument that my parents allow it and if there was truly a problem they would have me stop. Well I turned 21 this year and a little after my birthday I went to a bar and strip club with some friends and family and all of us got absolutely hammered and I had a few lap dances. \n\nNow, I told my gf beforehand that we were going to the bar and strip club and she didn't have an issue- didn't ask me to not drink or not to go there. I went and had a blast. As soon as I got home I told her about the lap dances and she got very angry at me for them and for drinking. This turned into a few days long fight and we very nearly broke up over it. The end result was me saying I would not drink again as she said she felt like I valued drinking over her. I didn't want her to feel like that, so it was my idea to say not to drink despite that not making me happy. \n\nI have a few friends who are a few years older than me, and one night after I promised I wouldn't drink I drank with my friends. I told my gf and she got very mad and we once again almost broke up. She views me drinking as me being peer pressured into it by friends and family and doesn't seem to understand that I drink just because I enjoy it. She maintains the argument that I can have fun without alcohol, and doesn't understand that while that is true, I like to drink anyway. \n\nThis is an argument that goes no where each time, and it just results in me saying I won't drink again even though I don't agree with it and it doesn't make me happy. I am 21, and I want to be able to go out with friends and drink. I'm not asking for acceptance to get shit faced each night.

I am sure that if I make this decision to become female sooner or later I will loose my Girlfriend, who made it clear that she is not into women. The trigger for this whole situation was a little test I took in order to diagnose some of my mental health issues (I am already in therapy for some other reason) and there was a question if I identifie myself as a woman and I didn't think much of it and just ticked it no, but after that i started thinking about it and it kinda made me excited but also I am really scared about it, while everyone around me will probably support me in my decisions I am still scared loosing people or making wrong decisions regarding my gender.\nI hope this is somehow fitting for this subreddit.

I know reddit isn't a place to diagnose myself, but the earliest appointment I could get with a cardio is mid-october.\n\n I'm 18 years old and for the past year had a problem abusing Adderall, nicotine (vape), and did ecstasy a few times. About a month ago I went on an adderall binge and one night experienced symptoms of a heart attack (palpitations, chest pain, tightness in left side). Went to urgent care and ran an EKG, doc found left atrial enlargement and said my symptoms were caused by my heart being put under heavy stress for a prolonged time. I wasn't allowed to exercise or have caffeine for about a week.\n\nWent back a week later, EKG turned out normal. Doctor cleared me and said my heart recovered and was normal again. Afterwards, I would have occasional symptoms like jaw\/left arm pain or palpitations, but otherwise I was fine.\n\nFast forward to 2 weeks later--I was cleaning my floors when I suddenly started to feel lightheaded and out of it, like I was on the brink of fainting. If I laid down in bed, I would feel fine again but as soon as I was sitting or standing, I would feel like collapsing. I rushed to urgent care again and ran another EKG, which came back normal again and the doc told me I'm just wasting my money on tests at this point. \n\nBut ever since that day, which happened 4 days ago, I've felt so fatigued and lightheaded all day, even when I'm not exercising. The only way to feel normal again is by lying down. I feel extra lightheaded after exercise though, even as mild as shooting around a basketball. It just concerns me that everything feels like a daze and my sensations are numbed unless I lay down in bed or my car seat. I researched POTS but that seems more like a condition that lasts for a few minutes after standing up, not for an indefinite time. \n\nFinally, I have a chest sensation that's **not exactly pain**, but more like something touching the skin of my chest. If I'm shirtless, my chest feels like it has a shirt over it or wrapped around. But it's not the same type of pain I experienced during the adderall phase. And to clarify, I drink plenty of fluids and am eating fine.\n\nMy question is, has anyone experienced any of the sensations I described? Or based on your knowledge, do you think I could have a serious heart problem? I have a cardio appointment in a month and a half but I'm worried things could get worse before then. Any advice or input is appreciated, thank you!\n\ntldr: had heart problems from adderall abuse, got better and was cleared by doctor, started recently feeling lightheaded 24\/7 and chest has a weird sensation of something wrapped on the skin (not pain). any knowledge\/possible conditions?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"HeartDisease","subreddit_id":"t5_3060r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/HeartDisease","subreddit_subscribers":757,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Feeling lightheaded\/dizzy throughout the whole day","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/HeartDisease\/comments\/cy48gd\/feeling_lightheadeddizzy_throughout_the_whole_day\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

It's true, I get more creative energy at night, which helps me work without distraction as well.\n\nWhile I was in school, I'd toss and turn for hours, until 3-5am, then wake up for school at 6am. So I started napping after school. I thought the naps were the cause to my late nights.\n\nIn the school-less summers as a kid, I noticed if I fell asleep before 3am, I'd have horrible, and vivid nightmares, and then wake up after a couple hours unable to fall back asleep.\n\nI just went to sleep at 2am last night, and have been getting short, 2 hour bursts of sleep all night, so I did some research and found DSPD. This is my first time hearing of it.\n\nDo you think it's unhealthy to gradually shift the sleep schedule back? My goal has always been 3am because I know at that time, I will be able to sleep through the night. A minute earlier, and I'm screwed.\n\nI have a theory that people like us have ancestors who acted as night time protection for our tribes. We served a massively important function in passing on the genes of our families many many years ago. And those genes are still there.\n\nThe only things I think that are unhealthy about this lifestyle is that it's hard to exercise late night, because of safety, and because you don't want to wake up your neighbors. So we tend to mostly sit still for long hours. We probably also miss meals because we think if we eat, we'll put more energy in our bodies and be up later, so sometimes I go from 8pm - 5pm, having not eaten a meal (5pm, because where I live, restaurants close between 2pm - 5pm, it's really annoying). And also, maybe we need to make sure we block out as much light as we can when it's sleep time.\n\nThe sunlight is always my indicator. Okay, sun is up. Time to sleep. My wife hates it, and it makes her worry about me. However, she sleeps from midnight til 1 or 2pm every night, so... we usually wake up at the same times anyway.\n\nAnyway, I'm really happy I found this sub. I always knew I wasn't alone, but I had never expected there to be gene mutations involved and all of this exciting stuff. And a whole subreddit of sun sleepers!\n\nReally, it's kind of sad, but kind of funny how much of my life has revolved around a disability I never knew I had.. Is anyone on a government disability program due to this condition? Not that I want to be... I'm just loaded with curiosity.\n\nThanks for listening. I'll be around.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DSPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2w7fu","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/DSPD","subreddit_subscribers":4969,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Whoa!

Fast Forward to 2 weeks ago when I decided to finally forget the excuses and start up again in order to jumpstart a healthier life style.

I was barely able to finish Week 2 Day 3 as my shins were in some serious pain. Even walking back to the house was tough. I stretched them out after and the serious pain went away and I was just left with the general soreness I've been used to over the last two weeks. \n\nAt first I thought the soreness was just normal since these muscles haven't been put through this stress in a long while, so I just pushed through it. Now I'm wondering it may be something more serious and perhaps I'm pushing too hard. I'm hoping this is not the case as I'm starting to get into the routine again and I really do not want to fail this time. \n\nToday was my rest day and I decided to finally go get fitted for a good set of running shoes.
