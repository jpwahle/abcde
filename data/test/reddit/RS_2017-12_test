If this post is a few days old, just message me with whatever you had in mind. Don't message something like 'you still up for a roleplay' because I'm always looking for some enjoyable scenarios, just feel free to message me whenever you'd like regarding my posts.)\n\nFeel free to look over my past roleplay scenarios? They're all pretty vanilla and boring, but that's how I am. I specifically ask no incest or rape promotes please?\n\n(If you've messaged me in the past and I haven't gotten back to you, just message me again calling me an ignorant bitch.)\n\nHello, I'm Ella. I'm 22 years old from England and I'm looking for someone to roleplay a sexual scene with me? Possibly long or short term, I guess that can depend on the scene idea?\n\nSo yeah, I'm incredibly lazy tonight and I'd like to play out a sexual scene with a male (or female) partner? The catch is, I'm completely shot for ideas at the moment and I'd like to hear any ideas/fantasies that you have in mind? Developed or not, I'm more than certain the two of us can help one another develop a small idea you may have?\n\nAlthough I have specifically mentioned my search being for a sexual scene, if you have a suitable non-sexual scene in mind, few free to show me it, I'd be more than happy to play a non smutty scene for the right roleplay?\n\nBut, I must stress that in your message, I'd like there to be about a paragraph of writing? Just so I know you're not one of those people to strictly do one liners in responses? If you do, then I'll probably just have to ignore you unfortunately.\n\nAs for what I'm into? I'm incredibly boring and I usually stay within the realistic/modern day scenes, I'm not totally into the ideas of anime, fantasy, video game etc. It's just not my cup of tea, although I'm more than respectable if you're into it. But me, I'm just into realistic stuff more than anything?\n\nMy kinks would be rough sex, anal, dirty talking, spanking, hair pulling, light biting, light slapping, risky sex/hold the moan, cheating, rimjobs, footplay, clothed sex, blackmail, ageplay, interracial, larger men, cream pies, facials, being man handled and being bent over.\n\nMy limits being animals, rape, incest,  BDSM (the whips and chains stuff doesn't do it for me), toiletplay, vomit, snuff, hard violence (slapping is as far as I'll go), slavery and gore. If it's not mentioned in this paragraph, feel free to suggest it, I'll more than likely be on board.\n\nAlso, I can play on here or kik, I use mobile so things such as chatzy wouldn't be ideal for me to use? Apologies for that.\n\nThank you,\nElla ","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"F4M - Looking to play out your sexual roleplay ideas?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7gqwkx/f4m_looking_to_play_out_your_sexual_roleplay_ideas/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw"}

I had (and sometimes still have) poor impulse habits that I've started to get under control since diagnosed with adult ADD (I am 26).\n\n\nI went to a tech school in Wisconsin and got an AAS in Computer Engineering Technology which is a fancy way of saying we learned very minimal programming and the basic principals of electricity and circuit design, I graduated around 4 years ago. My work history is complete garbage, I've never held a job besides for my current one for more than 1.5 years. My resume screams unreliable.\n\n\nI went to school (gather about $12,600 along the way) to attempt my BS in Comp. Sci., I hated it completely and left my internship and wanted nothing more to do with school (and still don't).\n\n\nWhere am I now? I've worked at Jimmy John's as a delivery driver off and on since 2012 and am there again for about a year now. I have a 2015 Civic ($17,000) and two credit cards that I have started to get serious about paying off ($4k @ 15% and $2k @ 23%). I work as much as my boss will allow so that basically my hourly wage alone pays for the bill and my tip money goes towards gas, car repair fund, and extras. I receive government assistance in the form of health care and SNAP. Here's what my typical month looks like...\n\n* Paychecks: ~$800\n\n* Tips: ~$866\n\n* Bills: ~$850 (varies with Heat, this includes min. payments for cards and everything)\n\n\nI typically try to pay $100/mo extra towards the card carrying the highest interest rate, more when I can.\n\n\nThe truth is I HATE working with customers and everyday is semi painful to get through work. I don't really like what I do but the reality is I need a job that pays $14+/hr but with my lack of good reliable work history and my degree I did nothing with, I don't know what to do. I'm 26 but I have never been more lost in my life. I also cannot move from my small Wisconsin city (50K+ pop.) and can't really deviate much outside of 9 - 5.

all! I\u2019m a tall (6\u20194), bi guy with a love of other tall people. As much as I love my height, I\u2019m not afraid of the idea of being with someone taller than me. In fact, I encourage it! Today I was hoping to work out some prompts with other big-bodied individuals, real or fantasy. Hell, if you wanna just hit me up and talk about how tall you are, how you wish you were tall(er), or a love of tall people, go for it! I promise I\u2019ll be a welcome ear. Below are some prompts ideas I had for anyone wishing to RP:\n\n* Semi-blind date: We matched on Tinder (or your preferred equivalent) and hit it off well, setting up a time to meet up and have a first date. However, I\u2019m about to discover you haven\u2019t exactly been as forthcoming about your height as I expected, to great surprise.\n\n* Long-lost friends: We knew each other a long time ago. Maybe since early high school? Early middle school? Whatever the time, we\u2019ve reconnected recently and are looking to meet up again. Boy am I going to be surprised when I see how you\u2019ve changed. (Noticing a theme? I love the idea of your height catching me off guard. Tons of fun.)\n\n* Athlete: You\u2019re an athlete (probably volleyball or basketball make the most sense, but I\u2019m willing to open my horizons. Personally, I am a huge baseball fan). I\u2019m either a fan of the team/you and have developed a bit of a crush, or we meet up in the gym or after a practice, and one thing leads to another.\n\n* Growth: You start off a more typical size. We can be friends (or more), we can just know each other, or we can be strangers. Whatever our relationship, something\u2019s happened that causes you to start growing, and I\u2019m among the first that notices. What ever will we do?\n\n* Your idea: Have a better idea? Hit me with it. Would love to hear what you have in mind!\n\n**FYI:** Yes, I\u2019m a male, but I\u2019m perfectly willing to play either an F or Futa (and have experience with both). Also, since size differences are fun, if you want me to play something smaller than my real height, I am certainly willing to accommodate.\n\nKinks: Sizeplay/Growth, Muscle, Exhibitionism, Futa, Body Worship, Cumplay, and more!\n\nLimits: Beast, toilet play, vore, inflation, extreme pain/control, strict non-con.\n\n[Kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/GpV966I.png)\n\nAbout me: I'm 6'4, 180ish pounds, more on the lean/lanky side. Longish brown hair that extends just beyond my ears, hazel eyes. If you really want to know what I look like, I have some pics/vids on this account for you to peek (thanks exhibitionism!)\n\nCome say hi, hope we can have some fun!","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"23 [M4A] A Tall Ask","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7gr253/23_m4a_a_tall_ask/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw"}

Anyway, I always had random thoughts about what it'd be like being a girl, but always set it aside as a natural curiosity any boy would have, in recent months I've started digging into japanese anime and related stuff, and I came across something that would amaze and disturb my mind, the gender bender genre. \n   At first it was just a sexual thing, got my hands on TG eroge and hentai with stories of boys turning by magic or science into girls and having sexual adventures in that setting, I got a little bit confused by liking it that much and wondered what that said about my sexuality, then, I found a manga, romance themed gender bender, with a boy becomming a girl, it said in the very cover it was a transgender story, and I read through it non-stop for 3 days, and on the last chapter when the boy decides he wants to be a girl permanently and declares her love for her male childhood friend that fell in love with her, I couldn't help but think 'this is so perfect, I want this to be my life'. It hit me that that one time fetish thing didn't seem that much like just a sexual thing anymore, I decided to talk to a friend about it indirectly, and looked back at my own life, I've always been shy, emotionally fragile, romantic, I've always had a desire to be cute, during all of my school years I always had a friend who I'd tag along with, and when that friend acted protective or kindly towards me, I'd wish that I was a girl so I could be treated like that all the time, so I could ask to be treated like that, so that maybe they'd always be kind and want to protect me, in my mind, I like the idea of being a girl and having a strong and gentle guy look after me, it feels like my behaviour would be more accepted, I wouldn't be expected to act manly, I would be able to indulge in girly habits without any shame. \n   Honestly I don't think I'd miss being a male, if I could just now become, by magic or what not, a female, I probably would without much in the way of second thoughts. I don't think of myself as trans because the idea of anything but complete magic style transformation into a girl wouldn't suffice, I'd just think I'm pretending to be something I'm not (this is not to belittle trans people is just my personal perspective). I know these thoughts are messy and I feel like I didn't convey them in an orderly fashion, but what do you think? Are these the thoughts of a trans person? I never thought of myself as trans but idk what to think, it's just confuse.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"asktransgender","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4b9","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I need to get this off my chest...","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/7gr52c/i_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest/","whitelist_status":"promo_specified"}

It was never that you had problems finding a man. Being a beautiful, educated and strong black woman would always scare away the boys that thought you could be just a side piece or the guys that thought they could handle your sexual needs while mentally they were lacking. It was driving you crazy just how hard it was to find a strong man that could handle being with an equally strong woman, but like Drake says *Know yourself, know your worth*\n\nYou found yourself sitting at the bar alone, your date being 45 minutes late and hasn't responded to a single text since you arrive. Sipping the remains of the last of your drink, you order another as you look around wondering why you even bother to put on your best dress and your make up perfect for the prospect of Sean from the mail room. You knew he couldn't afford a place like this or even keep up in any conversation you wanted to have, but you wanted to believe it would work out this time. It had been months since your last boyfriend and while your toys were nice; the desire to sleep next to another warm body and feel secure was set inside you.\n\nYou looked in the mirror that sat behind the bar, seeing the happy couples that filled the dinning room... well happy white couples, you never felt so out of place in that moment, hating every man that couldn't keep up with you or even give you a simple text saying they had to cancel and you could feel the tears start to build in your eyes. You knew that you deserved better and wanted more than any man had offered you before. The weight of a gaze fell upon you for a moment, the feeling of being watch for just a second hung in the air as a man approached the bar.\n\n\"Can I just get a whiskey neat?\" he asked the bartender as he pulled out his wallet, you can see him look over at you while you dig in your purse to pay your tab. His hand reaches over slightly, almost signalling for you to pause, \"I'll pick up her tab as well.\" he adds before turning his body to you.\n\n\"I don't mean to pry, but I saw you when I came in to drop my bags off and I just assumed you were meeting someone. But since you are still here, would you mind having dinner with me; I hate to eat alone.\" He says before extending his hand, \"I'm Chris.\"\n\nSo that's kind of my idea, a beautiful black woman surprisingly gets swept off her feet by a rich older white man... someone she never thought of dating. I really see this a leading to a Sugar daddy situation between the two, if you like it feel free to message me and we can build on it some more. Kink wise I love anal, creampies, cock worship, interracial (clearly), long term scenes, Dom/Sub (This needs to be discussed), Sugar Daddies and building relationships.\n\nAlso I have pictures of the type of woman I would like for you to play.\n\nMy name is Chris, I'm 32. I have short styled dark brown hair, with hints of grey and bright green eyes that beam when I smile. I have a light, neatly trimmed beard with a bit of chest hair as well. I stand 6'4 210 pounds. I'm in good shape, not a body builder but I can run a mile without stopping, not going to BS and say I have abs, I'm just a little soft; but you can see definition in my arms, chest and back.

My parents are extremely religious and charismatic. I've had quite a few \"conversion\" experiences made known to them that have warmed their hearts. There was a time when I was knee deep in christian apologetics, and I did everything to make that known to them as well. That also warmed their hearts. So in my quest for truth, I began seeing flaws in different theologies of christianity, specifically the protestant charismania that my parents adhered to, all based on where history led me. Even further, I was led to understand that the Catholic church is where I'd find the most historically accurate version of christianity based on the early church fathers. Well in the eyes of most protestants this is like playing with the devil because the catholic church is \"evil\" and so on. So coming to terms with this and hiding my beliefs from them is tough as it is, but now I find myself questioning even further. Part of me does not want to admit it, but I'm finding consolation in people who are atheist. I'm leaning towards agnosticism now, even though I cherish the positives of christianity, I'm questioning a lot right now. It's scary. Not only am I at odds with my parents, but I'm at odds with a little piece of myself. I'm afraid if I don't confront this I'm going to suffer psychological damage of which I know there is already some after years of living under the hysteria of my parent's christianity.

My relationship is otherwise balanced, healthy and happy. This one thing has been the biggest issue between us.\n\nWe've been together for about a year. For the first 2-3 months, he was all over me-- we had sex multiple times a day, he was constantly touching me, and I never felt sexually unsatisifed for a moment. Then things took a slow turn.\n\nI started noticing when we went to bed, he would just fall asleep without touching me, whereas before during our \"honeymoon phase\" he would initiate sex. Sex dropped to about 2-3 times a week, rather than every day. I just overall have felt like I'm constantly wanting to be touched by him and fantasizing about him, and when we hang out (we hang out about 4 days a week), I can never tell whether or not he will be \"in the mood.\" It's seriously, seriously getting to me -- and he knows it.  It's gotten to the point where we will get in bed, I'll be wanting touches because I shaved and got all sexy for him, and he just cuddles/kisses me a little until drifting off. This makes me absolutely mad, and many times has led to me blowing up at him/crying/accusing him of various things. I'm at a loss. I love him, I am 99.9% sure he is attracted to me physically as he always says he is, and when we have sex he's really into it. I just don't know what to do, because he gets defensive and hasn't made a big change.\n\nAbout him: \nHe has a physically and emotionally taxing job, so at night he is often very tired. When we first met, his job was significantly less demanding, so he had a lot more energy to give. He also gets bad stomach issues. Both these things always make him feel \"unsexy\" and avoid sex. \nHe gets performance anxiety, and I've made a lot of effort to show him that I don't care whether or not he can keep it up, I simply love the feeling of being close and intimate with him. When I get upset about his lack of intimate affection, he says it makes his anxiety worse, making him avoid it more. \n\nHe doesn't watch porn (we are really open about it and non-judgmental, just neither of us happen to like it.) he does masturbate once in a while but not too much, and would never prioritize it over his hobbies. I've gently asked whether maybe he doesn't find me attractive anymore (My appearance hasn't changed) and I don't make I'm horny, or maybe he's just bored, but whenever I mention that he gets really upset and makes me feel bad for mentioning it. He says if he wasn't attracted to me, he wouldn't be in a relationship with me. And I believe him. I know I'm conventionally attractive (curves, put together, tall, whatever), but it makes me worry he's just not that attracted to me. Like \"meh.\" it's kinda starting to affect my self-esteem, as much as he insists it's him just needing \"good circumstances\" otherwise he can't get it up. I feel sooo unsexy. \n\nI want to sext him, I don't want to cuddle with him and feel like his dick is off limits to touch, and I want makeout sessions like we used to. But every time we talk about it, we both get insecure and defensive.

First post here. I mean, even coming on this subreddit is a big step, but posting is a whole other ballpark. But I guess it might be good to hear from other people who might relate and be able to offer advice or their own experiences?  \n\nSo I'm 19. I used to identify as asexual when I was younger, but honestly looking back I don't know if it was the best label since everyone's hormones kick in at different ages? Eventually I dropped the label, and for the last few years have been identifying simply as a lesbian. Because I know for a fact that I've had loads of romantic feeling towards girls and been in love, and would love to be in a relationship. But as I've grown up and gone through puberty, the sexual side has just never come.  \nLike, I have zero sex drive or interest in sex at all. I'm a virgin but it doesn't bother me in the slightest, and I honestly don't even have any curiosity to try it out at this point in my life. I feel like being in a sexual situation would even make me really anxious. I've never been in a relationship, and only ever kissed people on stage in theatre.  \nAnd as time passes, and all my friends hook up with people, and get in relationships, and talk about sex (which doesn't make me uncomfortable, I just have nothing to relate to), I'm just more and more scared that I may actually be asexual. And I'm scared not because there's something wrong with it, but because I think I might end up alone.  \nI really would love to be in a relationship, but I just can't pursue one when I know that I have no interest in sex, and I don't want to feel pressured into doing anything just so I can have a girlfriend. I don't know. I hate to say it, but I don't want to be asexual. Not because I'm uncomfortable with it myself, but because I know other people are. I'm a part of a really strong LGBT+ community at my uni, almost all my friends are queer, but there is no ace or aro community in the slightest. I've never met or spoke with another asexual person.  \n\nIdk, I'm not even sure what I hope to get out of posting? But I've never talked about this with anyone before, so I guess even putting this in writing feels like a pretty big step.

Same jackass that actually called the cops over an internet thread and....nothing happened.\n\nAnyway, here's the email he sent.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHello, this is Luca Fury.\n\nI'm not here to start a fight -- quite the opposite, actually. I'm contacting you to respectfully ask you to delete that Reddit thread you made about me in the past (Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/2q7mkl/investigating_luca_fury_furys_fight_picks/).\n\nIf you refuse to do so, I will have no choice but to file a lawsuit against you (more on that below). I state this not as an attempt to threaten or bully you, but to inform you of what my next option will be should you refuse to settle this outside of court. As I said, I'm contacting you in an effort to seek a resolution, not start a fight.\n\nThe libelous, offensive claims you made about myself and my business are not true, and I can prove it. Whether you thought the claims were true or knowingly lied, the fact remains I am an honest person who runs an legitimate business that provides winning tips. It's not right for false claims like those that you made to be posted about me -- ranging from attacks on my character, to calling me a \"proven scam,\" to claiming that I have committed outright crimes.\n\nI am hoping I can reason with you and we can settle this like adults and put this behind us. If not, I will have no other choice but to file a lawsuit against you. I have already been in extensive contact with both a personal lawyer and Reddit's legal department regarding the matter. Despite my lawyers telling me I have a clear cut case, I have been told it was worth trying to reason with you first, in the hopes that doing so would allow both you and I to avoid the hassle that comes with making this a legal issue. It would be far easier, quicker and cheaper for both of us if we can just settle this and put it behind us. So I'm hoping you can be reasonable about the matter and will just delete the thread, since you're the creator, and we can get this over with.\n\nIf you're not willing to do that, by either directly stating so or simply ignoring this email, I will be forced to go ahead and file the lawsuit. I just cannot allow such offensive, false and illegal claims to be posted about me and my business. It's not morally right, nor is it legal.\n\nAs I stated before, I have discussed the matter extensively with both a personal lawyer and Reddit's legal department. Reddit is not liable since the content was posted by a user (you), so the only course of legal action to to file a lawsuit against the user (you) and take the user (you) to court for defamation and libel. The court would then submit a court order requiring that Reddit deletes the thread. In addition, I would sue you for damages and attorney fees. This would be a hassle and time consuming for the both of us, which is why I have tried to avoid going down this route. However, I will be left with no choice if you don't agree to simply delete the thread. I think we can both agree that keeping the thread up is not worth that hassle. \n\nAlso, should you agree to simply delete the thread, I promise I will not sue for damages or attorney fees. I will simply leave it at that and we can go our separate ways. However, should you refuse to delete the thread on your own and I am forced to file the lawsuit, I will be seeking money for both damages and legal fees. Again, simply deleting the thread is better for both of us.\n\nIf you'd to discuss the matter further, or would like me to prove to you that I run a legitimate business that provides winning bets, I am happy to do so. I don't wish for there to be a feud or an exchange of insults. I want to settle this in a respectful and quick manner.\n\nPlease get back to me as soon as you can, thanks! Remember, should you refuse to acknowledge this email, I will take that as you refusing my offer to settle this outside of court and I will proceed to file the lawsuit. So please reply to this in a timely manner. Thanks!\n\n-Luca Fury\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the record, this article was made because a member of the UG made a thread about him and he showed up raising hell and threatening people.  I looked into it more and found some people who used to work with him who had a lot to say so I gathered it all up into a thread and dropped it on reddit in the link above.  It's an old thread that is now archived.\n\nI probably would have deleted it had he been civil but instead he starts nice then quickly descends into whining and threats about lawsuits.  My response was a simple  LOL, fuck you.\n\nAnyway, watch out for this guy, he's a suspected scammer, conman and bully and he tries to get peoples accounts banned on twitter and MMA sites if they say anything negative about him.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit:  My response and his response via email.\n\n\n\n\n\nto LucaFury \n\n\n\nLOL, fuck you.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nLuca \n6:37 PM (19 minutes ago)\n\nto me \n\nAlright then. You'll be hearing from my lawyer soon. Have a nice day.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nMore threads about Luca Fury.\n\nhttp://www.sportsbookreview.com/forum/boxing-mma-ufc-betting/3093067-luca-fury-furys-fight-picks.html\n\nhttp://www.mixedmartialarts.com/forums/UnderGround/How-did-Luca-Furys-picks-do:2421618\n\n\nhttp://forums.sherdog.com/threads/is-luca-fury-fight-picks-\n\nhttp://forums.sherdog.com/threads/is-furys-fight-picks-legit-or-a-load-of-crap.3058349/legit.3340003/\n\nhttp://www.sportsbookreview.com/forum/boxing-mma-ufc-betting/2597920-why-does-everyone-hate-luca-so-much.html\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hwqbhaL.png\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother response from Luca.\n\nI see you said that had I contacted you without threatening a lawsuit, you would have deleted the thread. I actually DID multiple times not too long ago and you completely ignored them. That's why I sent a follow up email telling you that I would have to pursue legal action. Maybe you just didn't see the other messages? I don't know, but did try multiple times. Then when you still ignored them, I hired a lawyer and sent the latest email.\n\nLike I said in that previous email, I'm not looking for an e-battle. I just wanted to put this behind both of us. And again, if you'd like me to provide proof that I am a winner, I can provide it. Having e-beefs like this is a waste of time. I am still willing to discuss this with you in a civil manner if you are. If you got to know me, you'd actually see that I am a very good person. It's unfortunate that you have the wrong impression about me. I would like to talk to you and prove that to you. I would like it if you would at least consider that option. Thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd another email from Luca:\n\nYes, no, maybe so? All I'm asking is for you to open a line of civil communication with me so we can discuss this like adults. I am confident I can prove to you that I am honest and legitimate. Email, instant messenger, phone or whatever you prefer. Why can we not at least try to hash this out like adults? If you really were concerned about the truth, wouldn't you at least want to hear my side of the story? Because let's say I can prove that I'm honest and legit -- in that case wouldn't you, as a person, feel bad about unjustly dragging my name like this through the mud?\n\nPlease get back to me, thanks!\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nFirst of all, you didn't approach me in a civil manner, you started threatening me with lawsuits.  I don't buy your bullshit and I suspect there will be no lawsuits but I do suspect you'll once again send me an email pretending to be a lawyer and try to convince me of such.  Lawyers don't typically email people they are looking to sue, that's not how it works.\n\nThe reason that thread went up the first time was because of the way you conducted yourself coming to the UG and threatening my friends and fellow mods.  I also saw how you shut down naysayers by having them banned from twitter or other forums which just told me you were only interested in stopping these things being said by any means possible even shady methods.  You thought it would be cool to rob people of their freedom to express their thoughts and opinions about you and I find that disgusting.\n\nI've had plenty of people talk shit about me online and I've never tried to shut them down.  I'll debate, win or lose, but I'll never seek to quiet them just as I've never tried to have you banned from the UG, Twitter or anything else.  I'm also aware that you literally called the cops on me as well as contacted an old employer to attempt to have me fired, lol.  None of that worked, I saw no cops and I change jobs constantly so you were several behind on that one.\n\nI don't see you as a good person, I see you as a whiny manchild who throws tantrums when he doesn't get his way.  I see you as a bully, a liar and a thief and really want nothing to do with you.\n\nI don't really care about your betting record.  I've checked, I see that you've had a couple of good months recently and that is pretty much all that is showing on MMAbettingtips.  I also noticed that the shitty couple of years you had before don't seem to be included.\n\nYou prey on suckers to give you their money so you can give them what...a 55% chance of winning a bet which anyone well versed in MMA should be able to top anyway?\n\nIf the Reddit admins want the thread removed they can do it, I won't.\n\nBesides, I don't think my thread can do anymore damage to your shitty reputation.  Your reputation was hot garbage well before I even heard of you.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nWow, never saw this.  Luca just informed me he sent me a message on Reddit 10 days ago and was mad because I ignored it.  The truth is, I don't spend a whole lot of time on Reddit or social media in general these days, hell, I barely check my email.  Sadly, I mostly work, hang out with my girl and nerd out on Minecraft these days but here it is.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nFrom FurysFightPicks\n\nHey, I know we had our differences a couple years ago but I'd figure I'd finally come talk to you man to man. I'm not here to start another fight -- quite the opposite, actually. I realize I can rub people the wrong way, especially when I was an immature kid a few years ago, but I truly am a good person. I'm sorry if I ever offended you when we had our beef but I think we can both agree we should be above engaging in those types of e-battles. I realize you had people telling you incorrect things and you maybe thought you were doing a good thing by posting them, but they were not true claims. I am a good person who runs an honest business.\n\nI'm not here to threaten you, insult you or anything like that. I'm contacting you to respectfully ask you if you could remove that Reddit thread you made about me a couple of years ago. (Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/2q7mkl/investigating_luca_fury_furys_fight_picks/)\n\nI know you had your doubts about me but I have always been a legit business and have done everything I can to prove that. I have since been third party tracked starting in mid-2015 on BetMMA.tips and am hugely profitable there, having my best year of results ever in 2016. You can view my profile here: http://www.betmma.tips/mma_handicapper.php?ID=105600 That proves I am a legit winner and don't lie about my record.\n\nAlso, in the thread you made it was claimed that I steal people's credit cards which I can also prove is not true. Every transaction in the history of my site has been through PayPal, which means it's impossible to steal anyone's credit card. Whoever told you otherwise was obviously lying and provided no proof of their claims.\n\nAs for that \"lawyer\" who claims he audited my site. He lied to you. He's not a lawyer, nor has he ever been. Just as I said back then, he was a guy who tried to scam me into giving him money and threatened to get revenge on me if I didn't. That's why he went and did that. That's the honest truth. He later tried to pull the same stunt with another MMA bet seller.\n\nWhen you search my name, Luca Fury, the Reddit thread is like the 4th result. That is my name in real life and it's frustrating to have that come up when people you meet in real life google you and then I have to explain the situation. It's just not fair to me and I hope you understand that. Not to mention that, even though my business is thriving, it's frustrating and unfair to have a thread making false claims about it.\n\nIf you'd like me to explain myself further, or would like additional proof, I am happy to prove it. I hope you side of my story and we can settle this like adults. Thanks!\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nAnd another email, lol, holy shit, it's 1:30 am.\n\nFirst off, I appreciate you agreeing to open a line of communication with me. I hope that it continues, as I think you will see you've had the wrong opinion of me.\n\nAs for the reddit message: that's my bad. I thought you were active on there and I didn't know what your email was until this week. My apologies.\n\nBut now that you've seen it can you agree that I acted in a very polite and respectful manner with that message? Isn't that message exactly what you wanted all along? Like I said, if you really knew me you'd know I am a truly good person. I'm also very forgiving. I don't like drama and fights. I'm trying to handle this like adults and just put this behind us. Is it really a productive way for either of us to spend out Friday nights with negativity like this?\n\nI find it very hurtful that you have this wrong idea about me and claim I am a bad person in all these various ways. I honestly am not. I have hundreds of members who I treat wonderfully and they are extremely happy with my website. I would never screw any of them over. Like that one guy even commented in the thread: I not only refunded him but ALSO paid for his losses. You replied said you heard other people say the same. So does that really sound like someone who is a cold hearted scammer?\n\nAnd as for my \"earlier shitty years,\" I never had any bad years. I am 4-0. There is no proof of any kind out there that I ever had a losing year, because I didn't. I have several members who have been with me since day 1. If you'd like I could get you in contact with them and they will tell you I've never had a losing year and have won a ton for them \n\nI'm trying to be as accommodating as I can here, man. I hope you can see that. I really want to prove to you that I am legitimate, it's important to me.\n\nBy the way, I never called any police where you live or called any of your jobs to get you fired. I'm not sure where you're getting that idea from. Nor have I ever sent any fake lawyer emails.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nOk, I got another email from him.  I think he's pissed because I didn't answer his last email immediately since it showed up at like 3:00 am my time so he sent another about an hour later.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n1: You made a thread lying about me.\n2: I politely and respectfully contact you, asking you to remove it, as well as offering to show proof why your claims were untrue.\n3: You reply \"LOL, fuck you.\" and proceed to make several more threads lying about me and insulting me.\n4: I again contact you via email in a polite and respectful manner and you then reply to me via email, swearing at me and insulting me further.\n\nYet you claim I am the bad person and bully here? Really? In what world is that true? You attack me unprovoked and make up all these lies about me while I have been nothing but nice to you, even after the attacks, and your response is to further attack me? This is extremely inappropriate, uncalled for and downright immature by you. You're almost 40 and this is how you act?\n\nWhatever, I tried my best to reason with you like an adult and give you one last chance to settle this the easy way, and you replay me by making things worse. You acting in such an uncivilized and abusive manner is exactly why I chose to pursue a lawsuit -- and it will be filed against you now.\n\nYou keep making up all these lies about me but it's only digging your hole deeper. You knowingly lied about myself and my business with the intent of causing harm. You cannot prove a single claim you made about me, because there is no evidence of things that do not exist. Meanwhile I can easily prove they are blatant lies. There will come a time when you realize you should have just accepted my offer to settle this the easy way and avoid legal trouble, and you'll realize how absurdly nice I was to even offer you that resolution.\n\nThe process of filing the lawsuit was already started this week and you can keep laughing it of as just me bluffing but you're wrong, and you'll find that out soon enough. Just a tip: when you receive notice, you might not want to just brush it off as just some fake letter, like you claim I've sent in the past (which was another blatant lie by you).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate:    3/11/2017\n\nHe was quiet for a while then started sending me threatening messages on reddit from fake accounts talking about sending people over to my home (This idiot has no clue were I live) to make sure I keep his name out of my mouth.  \n\nReddit mods confirmed that Luca Fury used several fake accounts on this thread to defend himself and they removed them.  He has more though.\n\nSo, just to reiterate.  You say anything negative about this psychopath he will threaten you with not only legal action but wannabe gangster action trying to intimidate people with the threat of physical violence if they don't do what he says.  Ironically, I don't think this dumb fuck realizes that sending threats of violence, even online, can be considered terroristic threats and is a felony.  \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTL;DR  Handicapper makes outrageous claims and gets called on his bullshit on the UG after a battle with a member on twitter. UG takes moderate interest and Luca shows up to throw a hissy fit. Doesn't go his way until someone posts information forcing mods to delete the thread. Thread is recreated on UG and many old associates of Luca show up to say their piece.\n\nInformation is gathered and put on a reddit thread by myself which is linked. Luca has a shit fit about it and threatens me and whines to /r/MMA mods who say the thread is fair game and refuse to delete it. He whines and threatens me more even threatening legal action and sending emails where he poses as a lawyer.\n\nSilence for years and then I get an email a couple of days ago threatening me again even though I've said nothing to him or about him in ages so this thread is created.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit:  Apparently Luca Fury was kicked off of Cappertek a couple of years ago for violating their TOS.  LOL.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n09/18/2017  Update:\n\nSo, the lawyer wasn't fake but an actual lawyer from a law firm that seems to specialize in internet laws.  I received perhaps the most unprofessional email ever from them and assumed it was fake due to odd things said in the email.\n\nI was sent a Cease and Desist via email and I guess he mailed some copies to a place I haven't lived in years.\n\nHe actually is demanding that I go on mixedmartialarts.com, twitter and here on reddit and recant everything I said about him and say that it was all a lie. I'll post the email for you guys.\n\nMay 18, 2017\n\nSENT VIA EMAIL AND CERTIFIED MAIL DANIEL BAKER AKA \"DreamerMMA\"\n\n(Old addresses here I haven't lived at in years.\"\n\nRe: FINAL NOTICE - Immediate Action Required \u2013 Demand for Corrective Statement and Removal of Numerous Defamatory Posts on Reddit About Mr. Luca Fury.\n\nMr. Baker, You have failed to respond to any of our prior demands to remove the false and defamation content that you have posted in Reddit\u2019s MMA forum about Luca Fury. As we previously identified for you, your defamatory statements are outlined below (\u201cDefamatory Statements\u201d), at the following URLs:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/5irvns/luca_fury_mma_handicapper_sti ll_trying_to_bully/.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/2q7mkl/investigating_luca_fury_furys_fi ght_picks/s You have refused to remove the Defamatory Statements, which continue to cause provable damages to my client.

Attached hereto, is the Complaint that we are prepared to file and serve on you, if you do not comply with our demand below, within 7-days of the date of this demand. This is the final demand that you will receive from us, before we file the attached complaint against you.\n\nAgain, we are demanding that you: (1) remove the Defamatory Statements; (2) confirm that you will cooperate to obtain a court order for removing your Defamatory Statement (if required for removal); and (3) that you publish the following corrective statement on Reddit, MixedMartialArts.com, and Twitter: \u201cI have falsely accused Luca Fury from Fury's Fight Picks of being a criminal, a scammer, a thief and a person to stay away from for MMA advice.

Whether you thought the claims were true or knowingly lied, the fact remains I am an honest person who runs an legitimate business that provides winning tips. It&amp;#39;s not right for false claims like those that you made to be posted about me -- ranging from attacks on my character, to calling me a &amp;quot;proven scam,&amp;quot; to claiming that I have committed outright crimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am hoping I can reason with you and we can settle this like adults and put this behind us. If not, I will have no other choice but to file a lawsuit against you. I have already been in extensive contact with both a personal lawyer and Reddit&amp;#39;s legal department regarding the matter. Despite my lawyers telling me I have a clear cut case, I have been told it was worth trying to reason with you first, in the hopes that doing so would allow both you and I to avoid the hassle that comes with making this a legal issue. It would be far easier, quicker and cheaper for both of us if we can just settle this and put it behind us. So I&amp;#39;m hoping you can be reasonable about the matter and will just delete the thread, since you&amp;#39;re the creator, and we can get this over with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not willing to do that, by either directly stating so or simply ignoring this email, I will be forced to go ahead and file the lawsuit. I just cannot allow such offensive, false and illegal claims to be posted about me and my business. It&amp;#39;s not morally right, nor is it legal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I stated before, I have discussed the matter extensively with both a personal lawyer and Reddit&amp;#39;s legal department. Reddit is not liable since the content was posted by a user (you), so the only course of legal action to to file a lawsuit against the user (you) and take the user (you) to court for defamation and libel. The court would then submit a court order requiring that Reddit deletes the thread. In addition, I would sue you for damages and attorney fees. This would be a hassle and time consuming for the both of us, which is why I have tried to avoid going down this route. However, I will be left with no choice if you don&amp;#39;t agree to simply delete the thread. I think we can both agree that keeping the thread up is not worth that hassle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, should you agree to simply delete the thread, I promise I will not sue for damages or attorney fees. I will simply leave it at that and we can go our separate ways. However, should you refuse to delete the thread on your own and I am forced to file the lawsuit, I will be seeking money for both damages and legal fees. Again, simply deleting the thread is better for both of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;d to discuss the matter further, or would like me to prove to you that I run a legitimate business that provides winning bets, I am happy to do so. I don&amp;#39;t wish for there to be a feud or an exchange of insults. I want to settle this in a respectful and quick manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please get back to me as soon as you can, thanks! Remember, should you refuse to acknowledge this email, I will take that as you refusing my offer to settle this outside of court and I will proceed to file the lawsuit. So please reply to this in a timely manner. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Luca Fury&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the record, this article was made because a member of the UG made a thread about him and he showed up raising hell and threatening people.  I looked into it more and found some people who used to work with him who had a lot to say so I gathered it all up into a thread and dropped it on reddit in the link above.  It&amp;#39;s an old thread that is now archived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I probably would have deleted it had he been civil but instead he starts nice then quickly descends into whining and threats about lawsuits.  My response was a simple  LOL, fuck you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, watch out for this guy, he&amp;#39;s a suspected scammer, conman and bully and he tries to get peoples accounts banned on twitter and MMA sites if they say anything negative about him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:  My response and his response via email.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;to LucaFury &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LOL, fuck you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luca \n6:37 PM (19 minutes ago)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;to me &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alright then. You&amp;#39;ll be hearing from my lawyer soon. Have a nice day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More threads about Luca Fury.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sportsbookreview.com/forum/boxing-mma-ufc-betting/3093067-luca-fury-furys-fight-picks.html\"&gt;http://www.sportsbookreview.com/forum/boxing-mma-ufc-betting/3093067-luca-fury-furys-fight-picks.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/forums/UnderGround/How-did-Luca-Furys-picks-do:2421618\"&gt;http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/forums/UnderGround/How-did-Luca-Furys-picks-do:2421618&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://forums.sherdog.com/threads/is-luca-fury-fight-picks-\"&gt;http://forums.sherdog.com/threads/is-luca-fury-fight-picks-&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://forums.sherdog.com/threads/is-furys-fight-picks-legit-or-a-load-of-crap.3058349/legit.3340003/\"&gt;http://forums.sherdog.com/threads/is-furys-fight-picks-legit-or-a-load-of-crap.3058349/legit.3340003/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sportsbookreview.com/forum/boxing-mma-ufc-betting/2597920-why-does-everyone-hate-luca-so-much.html\"&gt;http://www.sportsbookreview.com/forum/boxing-mma-ufc-betting/2597920-why-does-everyone-hate-luca-so-much.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/hwqbhaL.png\"&gt;https://i.imgur.com/hwqbhaL.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another response from Luca.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see you said that had I contacted you without threatening a lawsuit, you would have deleted the thread. I actually DID multiple times not too long ago and you completely ignored them. That&amp;#39;s why I sent a follow up email telling you that I would have to pursue legal action. Maybe you just didn&amp;#39;t see the other messages? I don&amp;#39;t know, but did try multiple times. Then when you still ignored them, I hired a lawyer and sent the latest email.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said in that previous email, I&amp;#39;m not looking for an e-battle. I just wanted to put this behind both of us. And again, if you&amp;#39;d like me to provide proof that I am a winner, I can provide it. Having e-beefs like this is a waste of time. I am still willing to discuss this with you in a civil manner if you are. If you got to know me, you&amp;#39;d actually see that I am a very good person. It&amp;#39;s unfortunate that you have the wrong impression about me. I would like to talk to you and prove that to you. I would like it if you would at least consider that option. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And another email from Luca:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, no, maybe so? All I&amp;#39;m asking is for you to open a line of civil communication with me so we can discuss this like adults. I am confident I can prove to you that I am honest and legitimate. Email, instant messenger, phone or whatever you prefer. Why can we not at least try to hash this out like adults? If you really were concerned about the truth, wouldn&amp;#39;t you at least want to hear my side of the story? Because let&amp;#39;s say I can prove that I&amp;#39;m honest and legit -- in that case wouldn&amp;#39;t you, as a person, feel bad about unjustly dragging my name like this through the mud?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please get back to me, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, you didn&amp;#39;t approach me in a civil manner, you started threatening me with lawsuits.  I don&amp;#39;t buy your bullshit and I suspect there will be no lawsuits but I do suspect you&amp;#39;ll once again send me an email pretending to be a lawyer and try to convince me of such.  Lawyers don&amp;#39;t typically email people they are looking to sue, that&amp;#39;s not how it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason that thread went up the first time was because of the way you conducted yourself coming to the UG and threatening my friends and fellow mods.  I also saw how you shut down naysayers by having them banned from twitter or other forums which just told me you were only interested in stopping these things being said by any means possible even shady methods.  You thought it would be cool to rob people of their freedom to express their thoughts and opinions about you and I find that disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had plenty of people talk shit about me online and I&amp;#39;ve never tried to shut them down.  I&amp;#39;ll debate, win or lose, but I&amp;#39;ll never seek to quiet them just as I&amp;#39;ve never tried to have you banned from the UG, Twitter or anything else.  I&amp;#39;m also aware that you literally called the cops on me as well as contacted an old employer to attempt to have me fired, lol.  None of that worked, I saw no cops and I change jobs constantly so you were several behind on that one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see you as a good person, I see you as a whiny manchild who throws tantrums when he doesn&amp;#39;t get his way.  I see you as a bully, a liar and a thief and really want nothing to do with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really care about your betting record.  I&amp;#39;ve checked, I see that you&amp;#39;ve had a couple of good months recently and that is pretty much all that is showing on MMAbettingtips.  I also noticed that the shitty couple of years you had before don&amp;#39;t seem to be included.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You prey on suckers to give you their money so you can give them what...a 55% chance of winning a bet which anyone well versed in MMA should be able to top anyway?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the Reddit admins want the thread removed they can do it, I won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides, I don&amp;#39;t think my thread can do anymore damage to your shitty reputation.  Your reputation was hot garbage well before I even heard of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wow, never saw this.  Luca just informed me he sent me a message on Reddit 10 days ago and was mad because I ignored it.  The truth is, I don&amp;#39;t spend a whole lot of time on Reddit or social media in general these days, hell, I barely check my email.  Sadly, I mostly work, hang out with my girl and nerd out on Minecraft these days but here it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From FurysFightPicks&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey, I know we had our differences a couple years ago but I&amp;#39;d figure I&amp;#39;d finally come talk to you man to man. I&amp;#39;m not here to start another fight -- quite the opposite, actually. I realize I can rub people the wrong way, especially when I was an immature kid a few years ago, but I truly am a good person. I&amp;#39;m sorry if I ever offended you when we had our beef but I think we can both agree we should be above engaging in those types of e-battles. I realize you had people telling you incorrect things and you maybe thought you were doing a good thing by posting them, but they were not true claims. I am a good person who runs an honest business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not here to threaten you, insult you or anything like that. I&amp;#39;m contacting you to respectfully ask you if you could remove that Reddit thread you made about me a couple of years ago. (Link: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/2q7mkl/investigating_luca_fury_furys_fight_picks/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/2q7mkl/investigating_luca_fury_furys_fight_picks/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know you had your doubts about me but I have always been a legit business and have done everything I can to prove that. I have since been third party tracked starting in mid-2015 on BetMMA.tips and am hugely profitable there, having my best year of results ever in 2016. You can view my profile here: &lt;a href=\"http://www.betmma.tips/mma_handicapper.php?ID=105600\"&gt;http://www.betmma.tips/mma_handicapper.php?ID=105600&lt;/a&gt; That proves I am a legit winner and don&amp;#39;t lie about my record.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, in the thread you made it was claimed that I steal people&amp;#39;s credit cards which I can also prove is not true. Every transaction in the history of my site has been through PayPal, which means it&amp;#39;s impossible to steal anyone&amp;#39;s credit card. Whoever told you otherwise was obviously lying and provided no proof of their claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for that &amp;quot;lawyer&amp;quot; who claims he audited my site. He lied to you. He&amp;#39;s not a lawyer, nor has he ever been. Just as I said back then, he was a guy who tried to scam me into giving him money and threatened to get revenge on me if I didn&amp;#39;t. That&amp;#39;s why he went and did that. That&amp;#39;s the honest truth. He later tried to pull the same stunt with another MMA bet seller.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you search my name, Luca Fury, the Reddit thread is like the 4th result. That is my name in real life and it&amp;#39;s frustrating to have that come up when people you meet in real life google you and then I have to explain the situation. It&amp;#39;s just not fair to me and I hope you understand that. Not to mention that, even though my business is thriving, it&amp;#39;s frustrating and unfair to have a thread making false claims about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;d like me to explain myself further, or would like additional proof, I am happy to prove it. I hope you side of my story and we can settle this like adults. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And another email, lol, holy shit, it&amp;#39;s 1:30 am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, I appreciate you agreeing to open a line of communication with me. I hope that it continues, as I think you will see you&amp;#39;ve had the wrong opinion of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the reddit message: that&amp;#39;s my bad. I thought you were active on there and I didn&amp;#39;t know what your email was until this week. My apologies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now that you&amp;#39;ve seen it can you agree that I acted in a very polite and respectful manner with that message? Isn&amp;#39;t that message exactly what you wanted all along? Like I said, if you really knew me you&amp;#39;d know I am a truly good person. I&amp;#39;m also very forgiving. I don&amp;#39;t like drama and fights. I&amp;#39;m trying to handle this like adults and just put this behind us. Is it really a productive way for either of us to spend out Friday nights with negativity like this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find it very hurtful that you have this wrong idea about me and claim I am a bad person in all these various ways. I honestly am not. I have hundreds of members who I treat wonderfully and they are extremely happy with my website. I would never screw any of them over. Like that one guy even commented in the thread: I not only refunded him but ALSO paid for his losses. You replied said you heard other people say the same. So does that really sound like someone who is a cold hearted scammer?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as for my &amp;quot;earlier shitty years,&amp;quot; I never had any bad years. I am 4-0. There is no proof of any kind out there that I ever had a losing year, because I didn&amp;#39;t. I have several members who have been with me since day 1. If you&amp;#39;d like I could get you in contact with them and they will tell you I&amp;#39;ve never had a losing year and have won a ton for them &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to be as accommodating as I can here, man. I hope you can see that. I really want to prove to you that I am legitimate, it&amp;#39;s important to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, I never called any police where you live or called any of your jobs to get you fired. I&amp;#39;m not sure where you&amp;#39;re getting that idea from. Nor have I ever sent any fake lawyer emails.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, I got another email from him.  I think he&amp;#39;s pissed because I didn&amp;#39;t answer his last email immediately since it showed up at like 3:00 am my time so he sent another about an hour later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1: You made a thread lying about me.\n2: I politely and respectfully contact you, asking you to remove it, as well as offering to show proof why your claims were untrue.\n3: You reply &amp;quot;LOL, fuck you.&amp;quot; and proceed to make several more threads lying about me and insulting me.\n4: I again contact you via email in a polite and respectful manner and you then reply to me via email, swearing at me and insulting me further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet you claim I am the bad person and bully here? Really? In what world is that true? You attack me unprovoked and make up all these lies about me while I have been nothing but nice to you, even after the attacks, and your response is to further attack me? This is extremely inappropriate, uncalled for and downright immature by you. You&amp;#39;re almost 40 and this is how you act?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever, I tried my best to reason with you like an adult and give you one last chance to settle this the easy way, and you replay me by making things worse. You acting in such an uncivilized and abusive manner is exactly why I chose to pursue a lawsuit -- and it will be filed against you now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You keep making up all these lies about me but it&amp;#39;s only digging your hole deeper. You knowingly lied about myself and my business with the intent of causing harm. You cannot prove a single claim you made about me, because there is no evidence of things that do not exist. Meanwhile I can easily prove they are blatant lies. There will come a time when you realize you should have just accepted my offer to settle this the easy way and avoid legal trouble, and you&amp;#39;ll realize how absurdly nice I was to even offer you that resolution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The process of filing the lawsuit was already started this week and you can keep laughing it of as just me bluffing but you&amp;#39;re wrong, and you&amp;#39;ll find that out soon enough. Just a tip: when you receive notice, you might not want to just brush it off as just some fake letter, like you claim I&amp;#39;ve sent in the past (which was another blatant lie by you).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update:    3/11/2017&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was quiet for a while then started sending me threatening messages on reddit from fake accounts talking about sending people over to my home (This idiot has no clue were I live) to make sure I keep his name out of my mouth.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reddit mods confirmed that Luca Fury used several fake accounts on this thread to defend himself and they removed them.  He has more though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, just to reiterate.  You say anything negative about this psychopath he will threaten you with not only legal action but wannabe gangster action trying to intimidate people with the threat of physical violence if they don&amp;#39;t do what he says.  Ironically, I don&amp;#39;t think this dumb fuck realizes that sending threats of violence, even online, can be considered terroristic threats and is a felony.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR  Handicapper makes outrageous claims and gets called on his bullshit on the UG after a battle with a member on twitter. UG takes moderate interest and Luca shows up to throw a hissy fit. Doesn&amp;#39;t go his way until someone posts information forcing mods to delete the thread. Thread is recreated on UG and many old associates of Luca show up to say their piece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Information is gathered and put on a reddit thread by myself which is linked. Luca has a shit fit about it and threatens me and whines to &lt;a href=\"/r/MMA\"&gt;/r/MMA&lt;/a&gt; mods who say the thread is fair game and refuse to delete it. He whines and threatens me more even threatening legal action and sending emails where he poses as a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence for years and then I get an email a couple of days ago threatening me again even though I&amp;#39;ve said nothing to him or about him in ages so this thread is created.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:  Apparently Luca Fury was kicked off of Cappertek a couple of years ago for violating their TOS.  LOL.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;09/18/2017  Update:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, the lawyer wasn&amp;#39;t fake but an actual lawyer from a law firm that seems to specialize in internet laws.  I received perhaps the most unprofessional email ever from them and assumed it was fake due to odd things said in the email.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was sent a Cease and Desist via email and I guess he mailed some copies to a place I haven&amp;#39;t lived in years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He actually is demanding that I go on mixedmartialarts.com, twitter and here on reddit and recant everything I said about him and say that it was all a lie. I&amp;#39;ll post the email for you guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 18, 2017&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SENT VIA EMAIL AND CERTIFIED MAIL DANIEL BAKER AKA &amp;quot;DreamerMMA&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Old addresses here I haven&amp;#39;t lived at in years.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Re: FINAL NOTICE - Immediate Action Required \u2013 Demand for Corrective Statement and Removal of Numerous Defamatory Posts on Reddit About Mr. Luca Fury.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Baker, You have failed to respond to any of our prior demands to remove the false and defamation content that you have posted in Reddit\u2019s MMA forum about Luca Fury.

My warts were located mainly in my pubic area, as well as a few at the bottom of my shaft. I'm 30 years old now, and have only had one small wart in the pubic area a few months ago, probably due to stress and heavy smoking. I've had a girlfriend for 5 years, we've had unprotected sex inbetween treatments, she currently shows zero signs and has normal pap smears. They never had your typical cauliflower shape, although I did pick one once and it grew back with a slightly similar texture to cauliflower. All my warts looked identicle to the following, and have had 100% success rate with Cryotherapy; they would never grow back in the same spot:\nhttps://patient.azureedge.net/forums/images/upload/967520-13d93614-eecb-40e4-a857-a550c820cf66.jpg\n\nNow my current concern - For the past 3 years I have had white bumps growing on either side of my frenulum, and on the breve, that look like white tyson glands. Here are some pics and I'll write in point form how they behave:\nPERSONAL PICS (Note the pics where they look bigger, whiter, and more wrinkly is after a shower)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/rSUJ8\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Y1YYc\n\n-Started with 3 really small white spots, one on breve and two on the right side. 3 years later there's about 6-8. They seemed to have reached a certain stage and stopped growing/spreading. 6 of then are paired in two's, very close to one another, 2 of them look like joint.\n-Zero success rate with multiple and vigorous cycles of cryotherapy, condyline, and aldara. After a cryotherapy session, they don't scab, or fall off, then regrow. The area just gets inflamed, turns red, then they turn white again. Kept the are VERY dry, with foreskin retracted and a piece of paper towel in between the testicles and frenulum. After condyline, they look like they're scabbing, shrink, then return to normal size only 2 weeks later. Aldara also inflmaed the area, with the same results.\n-They look much more white and worse after a shower, similar to the ones on my corona which are smaller. Somewhat flexible, and are more white when stretched.\n-I punctured these spots gently with a sanitized needle before applying condyline. This didn't help treatment as expected, and the spots never spread (unlike the one in the pubic area which multiplied). Also, considering they are located on my frenulum, you would think they would have spread in 3 years to at least the testicles or scrotum, especially after intense exercising/sweating. Or have even grown much bigger.\nI went back to the original GUM/sexual health clinic that initially diagnosed me with warts and have been treating me throughout the years. 1 MD, 2 nurse Practitioners, and a handful of nurses all said they were NOT warts, and just normal penis bumps or glands, and that warts usually have rough textures. I was still worried and went to a dermatologist to get a second opinion. He looked at the spots quickly with his portable Dermatoscope and said it IS warts. So now I have a conflicting diagnosis. I asked him how he knew, and he said that papules/bumps usually do NOT grow on the frenulum. After doing some research, I found this was only true to an extent. Here are some photos I found online that look similar to my current white spots, in order with the ones that look mostly similar to my case:\n\nhttps://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2013/may/penile-appearance/\nhttp://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/0201/p519.html\nhttp://www.chestersexualhealth.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/STIs.pdf\nhttp://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hirsutoid+papilloma+of+the+penis\nhttp://wastefulpiece.blogspot.ca/2013/08/\nhttps://plasticsurgerykey.com/sexually-transmitted-diseases-2/\n\nMy current Derm can be hasty at times, usually rushes me out of the office before I can ask in depth questions. His idea that stuff usually doesn't grow on the frenlum made me not confide in his diagnosis 100%. He also removed a mole once that he thought looked atypical, and it ended up being benign. (Nobody's fault as it's hard to tell sometimes). He also scared me by saying \"might turn malignant because they are not responding\".\nDuring this time with my Derm I'd periodically visit the Sexual health clinic, and had yet a different MD, two nurse practisioners, and more nurses inspect me. They all confirmed they are again NOT warts. One Nurse Practitioner was actually upset I've been destroying my frenulum for 3 years, and to just stop.\n\nRECAP:\n\nOne Derm says they're warts. My family doctor is unsure and says possible pearly papules. 2 online Derm's say ectopic sebaceous glands. At the GUM clinic 2 MDs, 3 nurse practitioners and a handful of nurses all say they are NOT warts. Some even refused to spray the area and told me to STOP, as they were normal penis bumps. The Dermatologist is the only one who used a Dermatoscope, I think the MD at the GUM clinic may have used one also a while ago, I forgot, but she said no warts.\n\nWho am I supposed to believe? They are too small to do a non invasive biopsy, and even biopsies are not 100% conclusive. The condyline and aldara seems to get rid of them, but they were back in 2 weeks. I even tried putting the condyline on my obvious glands around the Corona, they also disappeared for a couple weeks and returned. It's a disillusion.\n\nThanks!","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskDocs","subreddit_id":"t5_2xtuc","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"(M30) Papules/Tyson Glands or Warts?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/7grcrp/m30_papulestyson_glands_or_warts/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

I'll delete it when I'm no longer looking, so even if it's days or weeks old, I'm still checking messages!\n\n---\nTL;DR I'm a intellectual, responsible, slim, Cute Geeky/Nerdy and VERY respectful guy.  I'm new to poly, very open minded, and open to options/discussion about the details and type of arrangement, but currently am looking to be part of a FMF or FFM triad, or similar arrangement.  One where all 3 of us are interested - and intimate -  with each other individually, and all together.  I'm looking for two bisexual girls (friends, dating, or even a married bisexual \"lesbian\" couple), or a single girl seeking a similar arrangement.  For a single girl, after we get to know each other, we can find a 3rd together (not a big rush).  I do want to add that I would be VERY respectful of BOTH females and their own relationship with each other, particularly so if they're dating/married before I join.\n---\n\nI think the above give a pretty good general idea what I'm looking for, although there are some more more details or points I'd like to add for those interested, which are listed below.  If you're not one for that much reading, that's fine, the above gives you a good general idea what I'm looking for, if you're interested send me a PM!  For everyone else, here's the details:\n\nI actually look a lot younger than I am.  I'm 33, 5'11\", white with short dark hair, and around 150 lbs.  I'm geeky/nerdy, but not obsessively so.  I'm a bit of a movie buff, I love Anime and all sorts of gaming.  Primarily PC, some console, and a little of tabletop/board games/card games.  I enjoy jogging, and happy to join you in sports or other exercise.  I don't drink or smoke at all.  I really enjoy cuddling and watching things in bed, YouTube, movies, Anime or Netflix (Stranger Things is AMAZING, and season 2 was a lot of fun as well!).  Of course, I expect to join you (two) in some of your hobbies or interests as well!\n\nI'm happy to give more details in PMs.  I'm also happy to exchange CLEAN photos after we've exchanged a few messages and there doesn't seem to be any massive deal-breakers for either of us.  After a little more chatting, I'm willing to Skype video chat if you wish, to prove I am the guy in any pictures I send.  Anyways, it'd be nice if you shared at least some of those interests, such as cuddling and watching stuff, and hopefully at least some PC/console gaming, if not some of the other types. :)\n\nTo be honest and up front with you, I'm inexperienced in poly, but I've been thinking about it for a long time now [a few years], and I'd like to give it a shot, I think there's a good chance it's for me.  That being said, I'm not looking to rush into anything too serious, and you should go into this knowing that there is a chance I may decide this isn't for me.\n\nWhile I'd love to find girls around 18-25 or so, I'm definitely open to anyone up to and SLIGHTLY over my age.  Due to my nerdy gaming/anime interests, I *usually* can get along quite well with girls in that age range, despite our age gap, so please don't let they worry you (assuming you're open to it in the first place, of course).  Again, not looking to rush into anything serious, so we'd all have a lot of time to think things over before making any long-term decisions.  And in the mean time would could enjoy our time together and learn lots of new things from each other!\n\nI also really love petite girls, but there's still tons of average weight girls that are still fun, cute and beautiful, and I'm very attracted to!  I don't expect you to have the perfect body, I'm not overly picky, and personality and how well we click matters a LOT of course.  Being of average to slim weight myself though, I'm not interested in anyone that's significantly overweight.  No offense to anyone that is, it's just not my thing.  Again though, slightly over is OK, I'm not a prude. ;)\n\nMoving on, as far as distance goes, I'll definitely consider anyone within a 2-hour drive or so (slightly more is OK) of Harrisonburg, VA, USA.  This includes Staunton, Charlottesville, Richmond, the entire greater Washington DC area, and many more (you can check on google maps or the like).  There's a decent chance I'll consider up to 2.5 hour drive or so [which would include Baltimore, etc.].  If I'm really interested in you (two?), you're super cute (particularly if you're petite and/or somewhat younger), etc., I'd consider somewhat further.  A big factor there is if you'd be able to host me overnight when I visit [not the first few times, of course].  If, once we know each other well enough, I can stay over a night or two [or more] when I visit, without having to get a hotel room every time, I'd consider significantly further, definitely 4-5 hours, and very possibly up to 9 or so.  If you can split the driving and we alternate who visits who for a few days at a time, then those 8+ hour distances become much more manageable.  Of course, MAJOR plus if you're much more local, that would be super nice and be a big plus, but I realize I live in a not to heavily populated area, and one that's generally not so open to poly, so I expect I'll most likely need to drive a bit.  But that's fine, I believe the right person - or persons - are totally worth driving for!  Anyways, when in doubt about the distance, if you're otherwise interested, PLEASE message me and ask!  I.e. for an enthusiastic person(s) that's genuinely interested in me, I'm going to be willing to put in some extra effort for them, within reason.\n\nWhile I am kinky and really enjoy sex, I'm NOT only interested in this - or you - for sex.  I'm an intellectual and REALLY enjoy getting to know, chat with, and understand my partner(s).  I'm also looking for us to enjoy lots of fun times together outside of the bedroom as well, both together and of course sometimes with just two of us - any combination.  I want the two females to enjoy some time together too sometimes!  Also, it would be very nice if you're kinky too, but I'm also fine with shy / inexperienced girls too [relatively or literally].  I'm not looking to rush into things, and am happy to spend some time to get to know each other first before jumping into anything intimate.\n\nOnce we have become suitably comfortable with each other and get to that point in our relationship, I'm definitely looking for all 3 of us to have sex together, as well as any combination of just two of us, depending on our schedules.  I just don't want any jealousy if two of us are intimate (i.e. while the 3rd is at work), and I'm hoping the two females can enjoy each other sometimes (or often) as well.  I also want to add that I REALLY enjoy seeing a female in pleasure and enjoying sex (whether with me or her), and my partners pleasure is very important to me in bed!  I'm not going to go into too much detail about sex until we get to know each other a little bit at least, but I will say that I'm comfortably above average but not huge \"down there\", and I usually can last a good while.\n\nFor single females, I realize finding a FF couple is VERY unlikely, and I'm totally expecting that if I do find someone from this post, it will most likely be a single female.  Which is still totally cool, in the meantime we can have a wonderful time getting to know each other and enjoying each other's company (and eventually, bodies), plus we'd have someone to talk about poly with!  It goes without saying that you should be looking for something at least vaguely similar, although I'm happy to hear and discuss your thoughts, desires and fantasies about other partner(s), and I'm open to other possibilities.\n\nAs I touched on at the start of my message, I'm open to joining a lesbian couple (that's at least a little bisexual).  I'm not your average guy, I'm VERY respectful, open minded, and secure in myself.  By that I mean I'm confident I could get along with you two fine, and make you feel comfortable having a guy around where you might not normally.  I don't mind you two talking about lesbian things, saying you enjoy a girl more than a guy, etc.  I want us to all be completely comfortable being ourselves and sharing our thoughts with each other.  I do realize that this doesn't apply to ALL lesbian couples, of course you two need to be at least a little bisexual, enough so to feel comfortable adding a guy to the mix in your bedroom fun.\n\nThank you very much for reading my post!  If any of this has caught your attention or piqued your interest, please send me a message, I'd love to hear from you!  Also, I don't get offended easily, so PLEASE feel free to ask me any questions you may have, even if you're just slightly interested, or curious for more details on a specific point, etc. I'm very easy to talk to, understanding, and not pushy.  Especially if you're shy / inexperienced, I understand you'll want to spend extra time before meeting, before getting intimate once we're meeting, etc.\n\nP.S. If there's anyone here that has been in a FMF or FFM triad (or something similar) before, and have any thoughts or advice to a poly newbie, I'd love to hear it in a PM!

I've been teaching for about 15 years. In that time I've had sex with a number of my former students. I have been married during most of that time.\n\nThis story takes place 5 years ago. It is spring, about a week before finals. Me and some other teachers had just finished running an after school study session to prep the students for finals. We were walking into the parking lot and we heard some shouting between a boy and a girl. We all rolled our eyes assuming it was a cliche teenage lovers spat about something trivial.\n\nAs we get into the parking lot we see the students arguing near one of their cars. (Names have been changed). It is John, a senior basketball player and his girlfriend Jane, also a senior. Jane is mixed race (Vietnamese and black and maybe some white too). She is maybe the sexiest girl in school. 18 years old at the time. 5'4'' with great curves that standout no matter what she wears. The poutiest lips and beautiful, smooth caramel-colored skin. Even when she was a freshman, she looked like a fully developed woman in her 20s and she's only improved over time. \n\nI've always had a policy of not messing around with current students, underage girls, or initiating relationships with students. She is maybe the girl I was most tempted to break those rules for.\n\nAs we start to head towards our own cars, John makes an aggressive move towards Jane, possibly shoving her. This means the other teachers and I need to intervene. We are maybe 50 feet away as we start to approach. One of the teachers calls out, \"Hey guys, it's time to take a second and cool down.\" John continues to standover Jane. Jane more or less cowers. I get to them first. I try to physically slide in between them and try to talk John down. A female teacher tries to usher Jane away. Jane says something bitchy to John and he blows up. He tries to push past me and raises his hand like he's going to hit Jane. I grab his hand. He shoves me and winds up to punch me. I don't think he's ever been in a real fight because he telegraphs his punch so far in advance I have tons of time to move out of the way and use his momentum to push him onto the ground on his knees. \n\nHe turns quickly and tries to tackle me. He's maybe 5'10'' and 160 lb. I am 6'4'' and 200. I played tight end on the football team in college so I am well practiced in taking advantage of my size and leverage against other people. I more or else pancake block him to the ground and get on top of him while one of the other teachers gets security. \n\nThis whole time one of the other teachers had been ushering Jane away to a safe distance, but she's seen the whole thing. John gets taken away by security and the other teachers and I fill out incident reports.\n\nA couple days later, I am getting ready to go home at the end of the day when Jane comes into my classroom. She starts apologizing about the other day. I tell her there is no reason to apologize; she isn't the one who tried to hit me. I see a little smile form across her lips. She is acting very nervous. \n\nI ask about John. She says they broke up and that he was suspended for the rest of the year. She pauses for a few seconds like she's deciding what to do next. Suddenly with purpose she walks up right in front of me. Because of the height difference, I am looking almost straight down at her. \n\nShe says, \"I want to thank you for stopping John. I was so scared.\"\nI reply, \"Don't worry about it. Any teacher would have.\"\n\"But you did and I am very grateful.\" Then she puts a hand on my chest. \"I want to thank you.\" - Now she is laying it on pretty thick. Looking up at me with big puppy dog eyes and biting her lower lip.\n\nShe stands up on her tippy toes and tilts her head. She wants me to kiss her but needs me to move in due to the height difference. With every shred of self control, I take a step back. I then give her the speech I give every current student who makes a pass at me that I want to hook up with after graduation.\n\n\"Jane, this isn't appropriate now. I could never have a physical relationship with a current student. I would get fired if I did anything with someone still attending this school.\" With the emphasis on \"now\", \"current\", and \"still attending\" while trying not to be too obvious.\n\nI turn around to gather my thing while silently praying she is picking up my signals. Looking dejected (this may be the first time in her life any straight man has turned her down for anything since she was 14). She mumbles an apology and leaves.\n\nI spend the next week desperately hoping she contacts me after graduation. Every time I have sex with my wife that week, I am imagining Jane. My wife seems to enjoy the dramatic uptick in sex she receives. \n\nTwo days after graduation, I get a Facebook friend request from Jane. I thank Jesus, Yahweh, Allah, and Buddha. I accept. We start messaging. She thanks me again for intervening. She says she still really wants to thank me again in person. I ask her what she means. She says she wants to thank me in a way only FORMER students can.  I reply asking if she wants to get \"coffee or whatever.\" She writes back, \"Whatever. Very much whatever ;)\". I tell her to meet me at a hotel in a couple days. \n\nMy wife gets an absurd amount of attention the next couple days.\n\nThe big day arrives. I check in and message her the room number. I brought a bottle of wine. I sip it while I wait. A little while later, I hear a know on the door. I open it. It's Jane. She's in black high heels and a tight red dress. The dress doesn't have any cleavage but it hugs her body in such a way that her breasts look amazing. It also hugs her sexy hips and fat ass (must be the black genes in her). \n\nI let her in and absolutely stare at her as she walks across the room like Joan from Mad Men. \n\nWe have some wine and talk for 10 minutes. I am getting impatient. I walk up to her so we are standing like we did in my classroom. I stare down at her. She looks up at me and bites her lip. I can no longer resist. I go down for a kiss. We start to passionately make out. I pick her up off the ground so I can stop craning my neck. She feels weightless in my arms. While we kiss, she is running her hands along my arms, chest and back. She seems very turned on by being with a large, strong man. \n\nI press her against the wall so I can free my hands. She wraps her legs around me. The bottom of her dress bunches up around her waist. I firmly grab her ass with both hands. She moans. I slide one hand to her breast and she moans again. I toss her on the bed roughly and the next few minutes are a tornado of clothes flying off. \n\nI decide to slow things down. She is probably used to dumb high school or college boys who cum in 2 minutes. She deserves better.\n\nI caress and kiss her all over for the next few minutes eventually making my way down to her pussy. I tease her with little kisses and licks until she starts to whimper a little. I then dive in and lick her and suck on her clit. After a few minutes, she grabs two hand fulls of my hair and is almost humping face. She screams and cums soon after.\n\nI move over top her. Being over her really emphasizes how much larger I am than her. We kiss and I start to rub my cock along her pussy. She grabs my cocks and positions it to enter her. She whispers, \"You're so much bigger than I am used to. You'll have to go slow.\" I internally laugh at this. I am not remarkable large, maybe 6.5 inches. But I love hearing it. (Afterwards she says that she tells guys that because it is the only way to get teen boys to go slower than full jackhammer). \n\nWe fuck in missionary for a while. I decide to rollover without pulling out. She is light enough that I can do it we easy. She rides me with lust in her eyes. \"I've wanted this for so long,\" she says. She starts moaning and throws her head back. Her whole body trembles as she cums. I cum soon after. \n\nWe snuggle in bed for a while. She tells me how turned on she got from seeing me rough up her boyfriend without breaking a sweet. She had been imagining me fucking her like a rag doll for the past few weeks. All this talk gets me hard again.\n\nI stand up and pick her up so she's straddling me and I fuck her in that position for a while. My arms get tired so I press her against the wall and fuck her harder.  Eventually I let her down and bend her over the bed for a good hard pounding while I slap her ass. We both cum again. \n\nAfterwards, we snuggle some more. I notice it is getting late. So I shower quickly and head out so I can beat my wife home. \n\nJane and I kept meeting for the rest of summer until she went to college. I took her out shopping a few times for lingerie, clothes and shoes. My wife makes quite a lot of money as an attorney and I really get off spending her money on my side women. We also hooked up a few times when she was home for breaks and the next summer. \n\n\n.........\n\n\nSo I have a few more of these that I think are worth telling. One involves me meeting a married former student at the gym. Another involves me picking up a saleswoman at a store while she was helping me and Jane buy a sexy outfit. Finally, there is the story of a student from South America who tried to convince me it was normal in her home country for young women to service older married men.\n\nLet me know what you think.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I got a lot of positive feedback on my previous entry (&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/7ga0cb/repost_teacher_and_his_former_student/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/7ga0cb/repost_teacher_and_his_former_student/&lt;/a&gt;), here is another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, some background: I am a 38 year old high school teacher. I&amp;#39;ve been teaching for about 15 years. In that time I&amp;#39;ve had sex with a number of my former students. I have been married during most of that time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This story takes place 5 years ago. It is spring, about a week before finals.

Personal finance is not my strong suit and I have been trying to learn more recently.\n\nMy information:\n\n1. I think I want to purchase a home in 1-3 years.\n\n2. My girlfriend, who I will probably marry, has $75k in student loan debt.\n\n3. I have no debt and I have ~$90k saved up (currently invested)\n\n4. My income will be ~$130k with ~$30k in GSU's\n\n5.

I have a short history which is probably hurting it, but I am hoping that it will be 750+ by the time I am ready to get a mortgage.\n\n7. I'm 25 years old.\n\nThe job is in San Francisco so the numbers above are pretty inflated. Home prices are very high, and I probably want to buy one at $900k (from what I've seen) which is usually a 2-3 bedroom home. The down payment would be around $200k then.\n\nMy question is which of these should I do:\n\n1. Should I max out my 401k contributions at $18k ($27k total)? \n\n2. Should I just save the money and leave it invested in index funds while I wait?\n\nI read that maxing out my 401k to take advantage of the match and then taking a loan from it for the down-payment might be an option. Is that a bad idea? Any advice would be appreciated!

When I see any relatively small object with a slight opening (such as my iPhone where the speakers are, or even my body spray's opening where it sprays from) I have the urge to point it away from me and if I do not, I become extremely uncomfortable. Once it is pointed away I can relax again and go on with my business. My desk/workspace is a huge mess and everything is out of order because, honestly, am too lazy to reorganize it. I am fine when my desk is neat or messy, but I need to point all small opening objects away from me. For instance, a highlighter. The butt end was pointing towards me and I felt extremely uncomfortable until I completely pointed it away, so the side of the highlight was facing me. When I was a small child, my mom sat me down and made me watch a movie with her called, \"Law Abiding Citizen.\" In the movie, Gerard Butler is killing a lot of people, and in one specific instance, he essentially hides a gun in a cell phone. As a woman answers her phone, the gun is triggered and it kills her. I am about 90% sure that this is what is causing my problem, but I could be wrong. I just do not know what my problem is exactly. Please tell me what you know if you think it will help, thanks. Other objects off the top of my head that bother me are: my game console controllers, pens, and tv remotes. Additional information if it helps: I always need to double, triple, and sometimes even quadruple check that I have closed a door or locked it to make sure that it is locked, even when I have already checked and I know it's locked. The same thing happens with my alarm clock. There have been some cases where I have sat at the corner of my bed for five minutes just checking if the alarm clock was set over and over, and even though a little light shows up to tell me that it's on, I have to keep checking the setting repeatedly. I do great in school and my social life is great as well. I do not get more than 5 hours of sleep on average due to massive amounts of homework. However, I have had this problem for as long as I can remember, and it certainly dates back to when I had a normal sleep schedule, so I don't believe that my sleep is a factor. Again, thanks to anyone who answers my questions. If you have any questions relating to this, just ask and I will answer to the best of my abilities.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskDocs","subreddit_id":"t5_2xtuc","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Do I have OCD?

I am Jack and I am 5'11, slim and In decent shape too I guess. My hair is a dark blonde and my eyes are blue. My cock grows to around 6.5 inches when fully erect.\n\nI started fantasising about older women nearly two years ago but recently the urges have become stronger and the fantasies have been wild. I'm a virgin and would just love to have some fun with a naughty, dirty older woman on here who knows exactly how to please a guy and his cock.... I would learn so much and be blown away by your skill...\n\nI will admit it, i simply love older women who are hungry for young cock, from the women I have spoke to in the past, its definitely the ones who simply love having a young body to play with that are the most fun so if you simply adore young guys, love the fact that you're a kinky cougar and arent ashamed to admit it then bonus points for you! One of the things i love about older women is their experience, they've mostly seen it all and done it all before and know just how to drive a young guy insane, if I was to be lucky enough to be with one then they'd give me standards that no one could live up to around my age.\n\nSome of my kinks include: Blowjobs, older women, being seduced, ass, anal, face sitting, spanking, lots of cum, dirty talk and women with experience. However, I would love to explore more and learn more about the things that get my teen dick so hard....\n\nI am open to most things and am happy to either chat or roleplay! A few ideas for roles if you wanted to roleplay are:\n\nYou are my mother's best friend.\n\nWe are neighbours.\n\nYou are my mom ;)\n\nWe meet at a hotel bar and we hit it off.\n\nYou don't have to pick any of those, I am open to other ideas! If we are to roleplay then I would find it hot if you knew that I was a virgin and really loved younger guys and felt like having some fun with me.\n\nI hope to hear from someone soon!

I was suppressing my problems with drugs and alcohol use, then enter you. I sat in that class keeping to myself waiting to get out of there and you sat next to me and you said hi, the most simplest thing ever and it warmed my day. \nWe kept talking and stuff and we traded snapchats and then the class was over not knowing if I\u2019d see you again. Then I went back to school a month later and you saw me walking and said hi again and my day was once again great, talking between classes we were really good friends. \nThen I had two tickets to Post Malone cause my friend bailed on me. And I asked if you wanted to go and you said yes. I\u2019ve never felt so good having somebody like you. \nThen at the concert we had a blast. Then it changed when it was over. You had no jacket on a cold night walking back to the car so I offered my to you and you declined but you were cold so I offered and offered then you said you didn\u2019t want to talk to me so I sat there silent the whole ride home. After you texted me and said you didn\u2019t want to talk to me see me or anything. Then that\u2019s when my heart sank, I was back to the little piece of crap that I was. Using drugs to feel normal and I haven\u2019t been the same since and I never knew what I did wrong to hurt you and I\u2019m sorry. \n\nEdit: since I am no man and I will probably never tell you this or even talk to you again I\u2019m gonna pour everything out to get of my chest. \n\nI know life is precious and amazing, but my is mediocre. I\u2019m come from a family that is very dysfunctional and they don\u2019t know how much of a toll that is is taking on me. Brothers that have been using drugs my whole life, getting arrested plus getting our house raided by the cops. And my parents my mom telling me that I\u2019m the reason that they are getting divorced, that they are only staying together til I am 18. It hurts. I\u2019m not the person to tell people or anybody my problems I bottle them up. So that my home life. Then in 7th grade is when I started my drug abuse everybody thinks I\u2019m doing it to be cool, but it to cover my scars that life has gave me. I met my first love in 6th grade she was a new girl and was just a friendly boy. We talk for hours on Facebook( cause it\u2019s what everyone used then) there wasn\u2019t one day that we didn\u2019t talk. Then I didn\u2019t have the balls to ask her out and I waited and waited. Then she asked me out in 7th grade (before the drug use) and I never been so happy and we dated til 9th grade and she was my world and my best friend. Until I messed up, she wanted to get serious, cause we are in high school now. She wanted to have sex and I was scared that it will ruin things so the night before we were gonna do it I texted her and broke up and I couldn\u2019t handle it I cried. I\u2019ve met plenty of wonderful women but not like her. Then I was a mess, failing classes using drugs I cried myself to sleep most nights in my room. Friends helped but they weren\u2019t always there. Then In some math class I had to retake cause I failed. I was sitting there doing nothing being depressed by myself and you sat next to me, there were many seats open that you could have chose,but you chose that one. You said hi something I haven\u2019t heard someone say to me in months maybe years. And I said hi back and I forgot all about my troubles my feelings in that moment and I lived. I loved coming to school just because of you and I felt whole again, I used drugs still but it felt different like life\u2019s amazing and then as soon as it started it ended I was done with the class and had to leave but at least I had hope so I got you number your Snapchat everything, but I failed I was scared to talk to you. From something soo great to something soo awkward. Then came the depression, the anxiety, and the self hatred. The drugs were back just to make me feel a little happy and the school came around again. I was just walking to class alone, then I hear your voice. The voice I will never forget. I heard you saying my name and I looked and I found happiness again. Then things pick up right where it left off. Talking and talking she was my world she was my friend my best friend. Everything was great then post Malone was coming to town and I bought 2 tickets one for me and one for my friend which bailed the day of cause of his girlfriends birthday. So I asked you with dread that you\u2019d say no. I was nervous I heard the phone go off and I ignored it and waited till I couldn\u2019t take it no more and looked at what you said. It read omg yes, and life was complete. We had a blast on the way there then in line waiting to get in. Then we get in everything is great and when the concert was over we look for our friends and she doesn\u2019t say a word to me. I thought ok she is tired, so we continued waiting for friends. And we find then and hear back to the car and you were shaking cause of the cold night and I offered my jacket and you declined and you were still shaking so I took off my jackets and put it on you and you took it off right away that\u2019s when I knew something was wrong. We get to the car we sit there she doesn\u2019t look at me doesn\u2019t say anything so we drive home not a word said and I get home after dropping her off and I literally break down in my room I felt so wrong like what did I do and I cry myself to sleep. And I wake up to a text from her apologizing for last night and that I should have wasted my time taking her and that she didn\u2019t want to be friends. And I froze.  Didn\u2019t go to school I felt terrible nothing was right and I can\u2019t handle it that something I did caused this I tried to fix it but I keep fucking it up and I don\u2019t hunk I could ever tell her that I loved her and now I\u2019m just some fuck up that has nothing going for him she text on my birthday asking how I was doing and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to say anything. I have this hatred and regret and I don\u2019t want to be alive. If you read this I\u2019m sorry and I love you till I die your amazing and you don\u2019t deserve the unfair hand that you were dealt with your perfect the way you are and you are loved, someday you\u2019ll find someone and it won\u2019t be me.

I appreciate your help. (Later: This got long. Thanks for tackling it!)\n\nI owe $260K on my rental property. My current Principle + Interest is $2K/month. The mortgage will be paid off in 2034, when I'll be 82. My health isn't that great and I doubt I'll live that long.\n\nIn 8 years, my son will head off to college (having a child at age 54 is financially challenging). I'll be 73. I anticipate having higher expenses in my later years for health reasons, e.g. I may need a live-in to help prepare meals and supervise my meds, etc.\n\nRight now I have about $4000/month *extra*, assuming my tenants pay their rent. That could easily drop $3000 or more, if I get a bad set of tenants. That happens every few years.\n\nI put my numbers in a couple mortgage calculators, asking what would my monthly P&amp;I be if I borrow $260K and pay it off in 8 years. Answer: $3200, $1200 more than I'm paying now. I like the idea of paying $1200/month for the next 8 years, in order to bump my income $2000/month for subsequent years. \n\nI don't want to refinance. I have to account for the possibility that my income can drop dramatically if I get bad tenants, and I don't have much of a cash reserve, so I'd be in danger of not being able to pay the mortgage. I want the higher payment to be *optional*.\n\n**Can I pay the loan off in 8 years by paying $3200/month against my existing mortgage, $1200 more than the P&amp;I?** How would I calculate the required $ amount I need to pay each month, to pay off the mortgage in 8 years?\n\nIs this a good idea? One argument: My mobility and energy is highest now and will be falling off the cliff in future, so I should use my current income to live life to the fullest *now*. I may be too feeble to hike Kilimanjaro when I'm 73. That means $1200/month now is worth *more* than $2000/month 8 years from now. On the other hand, there are those anticipated increased costs of care in my later years. An extra $2000/month could be crucial. There's also the advantage of leaving a paid-off property to my sons, which likely will *not* be the case if I don't make accelerated payments.\n\nDid you read all that? THANKS! \n\nSuggestions? Ideas? Advice?\n\nI *will* build up my six-months' expenses reserve before undertaking accelerated mortgage payments, if I decide to do that. That will take about 9 months, if tenants pay their rent.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nTL/DR: I'm considering trying to pay off my mortgage in 8 years instead of the scheduled 17. I think that will cost me $1200/month now, to gain $2000/month income when the mortage is paid off.

I met this great guy nearly 6 months ago and we have been really good together. He is 10 years older than me. I am 45yrs old. He has 3 cousins from his younger sister. 2 nieces and one nephew. But the problem is with his 26 year old loud-mouthed niece. This girl calls him everyday on video call while she is driving home. They live in a different country that is 10 hours time difference. First of all, I believe that, it is dangerous to be doing a video call or any call while driving. I tried to tell my boyfriend about this but he just waived it aside. He has her photo on his phone screen. When I complained that she is not a little girl anymore, he replaced the photo with the girl and her sister together. A slap in the face. She is 26. I don't know whether this is because he has no child of his own. He chose not to have a child.  Never married just a living girlfriend who is now an ex.\n\nWhenever he picks her call she would yell his name out as if she is talking to her boyfriend even in my presence. Not with any sign of respect that you give an uncle. I am from Africa while they are African-American but I do know that African-Americans don't call their uncles, who is 30 years older than them by their first name but Uncle this or uncle that. She talks to him like a boyfriend, reprimands him disrespectfully. Like two days ago asking him \"What is all that hair on your head because he hasn't shave his hair? \n\nI am not saying you cannot be close to your uncle but there should be a boundary especially when they are the opposite sex. I have been observing this relationship but it gives me the creeps. I found the niece half naked pictures, I mean her wearing sexy black lingering on his office computer. She took this photo in front of a mirror.  I said nothing for a while as I don't know what is going on. Later he made a comment about the photo and gave the excuse that when she came visiting she plugged her phone into his office computer and the photo just downloaded. Now, I know that Iphone will always ask you, if you want to trust a computer. before it downloads your phone only after you clicked, trust this computer. \n\nMy boyfriend would be going to Europe on a sabbatical next year and he asked me to find an accommodation that this girl will come to visit, even joking that we could do a \"three-some\" I said isn't she supposed to be working? How is she going to get away? He said she would come. He buys her anything she asks for. The other cousins do not call like this at all. He told me this girl was asking him recently how does he want to be buried! He is 55 years old and still has a mum. I don't know but my gut feeling tells me that this girls is only this close because he is very generous and waiting on his will. I don't know but my man has told me that I am the only one who has shown him that I am not with him for his money not even a member of his family.\n\nDo you guys think that I am overreacting about this relationship?

At the moment, I can think of a few mechanics/systems:\n* Killed players have a low percentage (i.e. 0% to 10%) to drop any of their equipment... therefore, 90% to 100% of the killed player's item disappear thusly discouraging the other players from killing unless they *really* want that new gun or whatever\n* Have a down-but-not-out system where a player can knock down a player and make a deal (\"I won't kill you if you give me 5 shotgun shells and your new kick-ass shotgun.\") and make both players invincible for x seconds afterward (so the players can part ways).\n* Award much more experience, items, etcetera for helping randoms instead of killing them\n\nPlease let me know if there are any other systems that would help the cause. And if you're a developer, I'm 99.845% confident y'all already discussed such\u2014but if not, I'd be happy to continue the discussion. Best of luck, Crytek and Hunt: Showdown!\n\n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"HuntShowdown","subreddit_id":"t5_3kh5d","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Initial Excitement + How to Discourage Shoot-on-Sight Response","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntShowdown/comments/7gs3di/initial_excitement_how_to_discourage_shootonsight/","whitelist_status":null}
