All my friends are female, because I still live within homophobia in my daily life with other males. My parents tell me they are supportive of gays and such. But I tried coming out to them one day, and my dad seemed disappointed. He argued in public with me, saying being like this at this age is completely stupid, and saying that it could be a mental illness, and he gets up, and my mother looks at me, and says I can't be gay. They will still call me straight, but everytime I try to do something they say \"I can't do that\" and they say \"When I move out, I can do that, because I'll be an adult.\" and a while ago, I was at a restaurant with my dad. He asked me how my friend's relationship was doing (female x female) and I said they broke up. He said that was good, since they were \"too young\" (15 years old) and I said it wasn't that, and I said their dad split them up. And he said \"good, still too young.\" I replied her dad is very homophobic and we can't talk about it around him. He shook his head, looking down, sighing. I came home from school one day, with my mom knowing I was talking to guys and liking them, my mother had told me that I can't be like this, and thinks I might be confused. And tells me she supports it, but I can't be like this at my age. I felt kinda disappointed, but they always tell me they're proud of me for being open minded and successful and smart. I love them, and they love me. But they tell me they're like this because it isn't acceptable to others, and they will be looked down upon, and they see it as a fad.

Before you judge my irresponsibility, please read the whole story below. I'm putting it last in case you don't want to read it.\n\nTo say I am devasted and heartbroken doesn't even begin to describe my feelings. I feel like part of me has been ripped away. I'm 50, and I've owned and rescued and lost a lot of pets, but every one who died in my care did so after a long life or illness.  It's now a week later, and I'm only starting to live normally again. I think today may be the first day I haven't cried since she died. \n\nI know dogs are killers at heart, and so are cats. I've never been angry or upset when my cat has brought me a squirrel or a bird. I'm sad, but it's nature. And right now I don't feel angry with my dog. I haven't punished her. What's the point? She forgot what she did 5 minutes later, and to her it was clearly irresistible. \n\nBut I've been having upsetting thoughts about euthanizing her, wondering how I could kill her painlessly, wondering if I could get away with it, or wondering if I could have my vet do it since she killed another animal, wondering what my husband would think if I killed her or had her euthanized, what my vet would think, and wondering if I could bear knowing I killed her. I don't like our dog. She's a burden I put up with gracefully. I wouldn't miss her.\n\nThe weird thing is that I don't feel angry at her. I just can't put another kitten in harm's way, so as long as I have my dog, I can't get a kitten. I desperately want one, and my dog is standing between me and happiness.\n\nI can't phrase what I want for an answer. I just want someone to read this and talk to me without judgment and with kindness.\n\nOkay. Here's the whole story if you'd interested. \n\nOur dog, Daisy, had never tried to attack any of our cats ever. And when she made contact with the three kittens we were fostering for the local Humane Society, she was always gentle, sniffing their noses and wagging her tail. Nonetheless, just in case, if our whole family was gone from the house, we put her behind a closed door. And whenever we were home, someone was always with Raven, the one kitten we kept. She was a sociable little kitten, so it was easy to keep track of her.\n\nThe night of the 23rd, we had a visit from a large family with their five children. They came caroling with gifts, so we let them in for a short visit. The first thing we did was put Daisy behind a closed bedroom door, just in case. She's a sweet dog but gets anxious when there are a lot of children, and, including my son, there were now six boisterous children running around, with four extra adults, including my parents visiting.\n\nA child, we don't know who, let Daisy out of the bedroom. The child must have meant well--all these kids know and love Daisy. But we didn't know she was out until my son started screaming. My husband and I rushed over, and saw Daisy had Raven in her mouth. I pried Daisy's jaws open to get Raven out. The kitten wasn't bleeding, but something was still terribly wrong. We rushed her to a 24 hour vet near our house. It took less than 10 minutes to get there.\u00a0\n\nThey put her in an oxygen tank because she wasn't breathing well. When they thought it was safe enough, they put in a catheter, gave her pain medication, sedated her, and took x-rays. The x-rays showed massive trauma to her GI tract, with gas and food all over her abdomen where it shouldn't be. There were other problems too, with a large bulge near her rectum, and she continued to have trouble breathing.\u00a0\n\nThe vet explained that the only option at this point was exploratory surgery to see if the damage could be repaired. I have had a lot of pets, and I've become pretty good at reading vets, and this vet didn't think this kitten was going to survive. I told him to euthanize her.\n\nThis turned out to be the correct decision. As I was holding her for the last time, waiting for the vet to come deliver the medication, she died in my arms. I felt the life leave her little body. The vet administered the euthanizing drugs just in case, but she was already gone.\n\nWe (my son, my husband, and I) all became very attached to her in the short time we had her--she was a perfect little kitten in every way: loving, playful, affectionate, and even quirky. She liked licking our faces, hard and vigorously, and she like to stand up like a prairie dog. She was the most mellow girl kitten I've ever known.\n\nWe think what happened is that Daisy felt threatened by all the \"invaders\" in her home and she attacked what she saw as the weakest one. We know even trusted animals can be unpredictable, which is why she was put in a bedroom in the first place. Unfortunately children are unpredictable too.\n","archived":false,"suggested_sort":null,"score":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"hide_score":false,"gilded":0,"over_18":false,"media_embed":{},"brand_safe":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1483229557,"thumbnail":"self","locked":false,"spoiler":false,"retrieved_on":1489388117,"quarantine":false,"hidden":false,"stickied":false,"num_comments":3,"id":"5lcinv","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"My dog killed my kitten.

She was 8. Messed up I know. It wasn't aggressive, it was simply foolish. We didn't even see skin, we were fully clothed. But hands went under clothing.\n\nA few months later, she tells my mom and she was fearful of my then step-dad finding out and called the police. I was then put in a system to say what I did and no matter how truthful I was, they pressured me to confess more and more saying stuff like \"that can't be all\" and so I confessed more than I did. Nobody really wanted to listen to me at the time. I was first charged with 4 counts of rape of a child and several more charges of molestation. It was later dropped down to one charge of attempted rape of a child via plea bargains with public defender.\n\nAfter years and years of institutionalization, therapy, etc. I finally lived back at home around 16 years of age. I moved out at 18. At 19, my uncle told me the law in WA changed and I was able to get my record sealed which lead me to go to college knowing I won't have to reveal my record in every damn interview. \n\nEver since I was 16, my sister and I have had a great relationship and never really talked about what happened till recently. In fact, we just got back from a long road trip to several amusement parks with my girlfriend. I'm 25 now so this has happened so long ago that it's kind of hard to remember every detail. Point is, it's there in the eyes of the military and government jobs requiring SSBI and other checks. My sister and I talked about this and she actually brought it up with me and said she knows I always wanted to join the Air Force and if there's anything she can do to help she will.\n\nI've never done anything else against the law except for speeding and forgetting to renew tags once. \n\nMy question is simple, is it even possible at this point? I looked into expungement a little but from what I've gathered before, it's a felony in of itself if you don't disclose any conviction whether or not it was sealed or expunged. Is there more that could be done? \n\nLast question: What type of lawyer should I contact for more info?","archived":false}

So far I'm 5-0 with it, but only in rank C, so YMMV.  However: you get almost the whole deck from 1 copy of the Shadowcraft precon and your 15 free Bahamut packs, so it's easy to build on a budget.  I am looking to tune it up, I think the core idea is sound but I'm sure I haven't executed it as cleanly as a master level player would.  This list gets its \"midrange\" more from card advantage allowing multiple plays or good trades than from having a lot of 4s and 5s.  I think this makes it more consistent than a size-based midrange list.  \n\nThis is the current decklist after 5 games and 0 tuning.  \n\n1 mana:\n1x Skull Beast\n2x Skeleton Fighter (Here the main question is, are the 1 drops 1 drops (Skull Beast) or are they filler for later (Skeleton Fighter).  I think Goblin Mage fills the curve nicely enough that Skull Beast is just better 75% of the time.)\n\n2 mana:\n3x Ghosthound Sexton (Haven insurance)\n3x Lurching Corpse (trades with Aurelia, causes accidental Imperial Dragoon suicide, or just dies to Necroassassin.)\n3x Undying Resentment\n1x Skullcradle Widow (I'm not sure yet if she's great or subpar.  You would rather have a 2/x body against Sword's 1/2s but I know she feels really annoying to face from the other side of the table.)\n\n3 mana:\n3x Goblin Mage (This card is amazing.)\n1x Angelic Barrage (I only own 1.  Probably would be 2x otherwise)\n3x Feathered Patroller\n3x Attendant of Night\n1x Soul Hunt (Probably a 2x if I open another since it's very good.  Not 3x because I think 2 in the same hand would get awkward.)\n1x Spirit Cycle \n\n4 mana:\n3x Playful Necromancer (super useful evolve for countering X/2 big bodies left over from opposing evolves.  Decent body if not evolved.)\n2x Necroassassin (Much better than Impious Resurrection imo.  It kills something on board right now rather than creating something that can't attack until next turn without an evo.)\n\n5 mana:\n2x Wind God\n1x Cerberus\n1x Ceridwen (He might not be as good as I thought, since rezzed Wind Gods are a lot worse than played Wind Gods.)\n2x Call of the Void (better Dance of Death.)\n\n6 mana +:\n1x Death's Breath (I only own 1.  Nice to set up a Lurching+Wind God turn 7.)\n1x Lord of the Flies\n1x Mordecai the Duelist\n1x Prince of Darkness\n\nThe curve looks ~~slightly heavy at 3~~ like I'm a total noob (3/10/12/5/6/1/1/2), but Goblin Mage does a lot to smooth out turns 4 and 5, and missing turn 1 just isn't that important to this deck.  Also, the 3s are generally better than my opponent's 3s.  Apprentice Necromancer didn't make the cut (2 damage beats a Zombie body going into evolve turns imo), and I'm still heavy at 3.","suggested_sort":"confidence","score":2,"author_flair_css_class":"107","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"edited":false,"author_flair_text":"","hide_score":false,"gilded":0,"brand_safe":true,"media_embed":{},"over_18":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1483231683,"thumbnail":"self","spoiler":false,"locked":false,"retrieved_on":1489388197,"quarantine":false,"hidden":false,"stickied":false,"num_comments":1,"id":"5lcoi0","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Midrange Face Shadow","author":"Nelagend","secure_media":null,"domain":"self.Shadowverse"}

This is a short-term D&amp;D style roleplay and I'm looking for a dungeon master/mistress for my sexy adventure! This world is only women and made up of humanoid races, humans, elves, half-elves, dark elves, succubi etc.\n\nMy name is Haley. I'm 5'8, slim with barely C cups and a toned butt, brown eyes and hair down past my shoulders. I wear a maroon thong, bra, a lavender hairtie, and strapon harness with a 6 inch maroon cock. I also have two 7 inch dildaggers (Firm rubber dildos shaped like daggers with hand guards), one maroon, one lavender.\n\nStrapons contain our strength and lifeforce, and we feel their stimulation. We cum out sparkling cum that matches the color of our cocks, and it weakens us. It takes 3 orgasms to defeat me normally, but 'bosses' with their expertise/special talents can drain all three if I cum once to them. The third orgasm will make me cum and cum sizeable spurts as my cock shrinks bit by bit, until its shriveled dry and detaches from my harness. With my strapon dried out, I will be completely helpless and beaten. If I'm forced to swallow my shriveled cock I will have another convulsing orgasm, before becoming gelatinous sparkling maroon, eventually melting into a cum puddle - this is the ultimate humiliation to a strapon warrior.\n\nI'll be going a short adventure/quest that I was thinking could be a dungeon crawl! I'm looking for a detailed writer, who can keep things fun, suspenseful and surprising! Maybe we can have weapons, loot, gear, leveling up and skills if we get that far.\nFor my orgasm/defeat scenes I would like you to write them, hopefully long and detailed and I'll match you in my response. Maybe each scene can vary depending on who defeats me, what they want from me/how they want to humiliate me. My 3rd orgasm is strapon defeat, which will seal my fate whatever it might be.\n\nAn example defeat would be, beaten, exhausted, stripped, and looted, my dominatrix laughing and stroking herself, while one of her minions strokes my strapon and another holds my feet by my ears so I'm curled over myself, my strapon aimed at my reluctantly moaning mouth. My dominmatrix then could take her first minions place and cum on my cock, which in turn forces me to cum, then she milks me dry all over my face!\n\nFor weapons I was thinking a great majority of them would be dil and vi (vibrator) replicas of what they're based on, dilsword, viaxe, vigreatsword, dilarrow, dildarts and for traps, dilspikes, hot jello cum etc. There can also be whips, cuffs, poisons that induce lust or cumming etc.\n\nClothes will serve as armor and there can be earrings, lipstick, makeup, hairdye, stockings, different lingerie, fingerless gloves etc.\n\nIf anyone's interested please message me!","permalink":"/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5lcomk/22f4a_dungeons_and_dildos/","id":"5lcomk","num_comments":1,"secure_media":null,"domain":"self.dirtypenpals","author":"strapondefeated","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"[22F4A] Dungeons and Dildos","retrieved_on":1489388198,"stickied":false,"hidden":false,"quarantine":false,"distinguished":null,"locked":false,"spoiler":false,"created_utc":1483231730,"thumbnail":"nsfw","link_flair_css_class":null}

I hated seeing the way they acted and all, I didn't think it looked cool to drink at all and made a promise to myself at about 15-16 (16 being the drinking age where I was) that I'd never drink in my life. Not because I wouldn't be able to control myself, but just because I started to hate alcohol. Out of all of what I saw, the way my father acted really struck a cord. He never hurt anybody physically but I really really hated him for everything he did while being drunk, that's one of the big reasons I made my decision. \n\nPeople slowly asked me why I never drank alcohol but I always said it's a personal life decision, sometimes I'd go into more detail. Some would not force me but really push me to drink but I refused. \n\nNow I'm 23, and I still never drank alcohol in my life. It's getting harder to refuse since its slowly becoming obvious to me that not having alcohol in my blood is kinda hindering my social life. I didn't mention it but on top of that, I'm more of a shy guy so yeah... I guess alcohol could help but I have a feeling in my gut everytime I think about maybe saying \"what the hell\"  and get it over with. \n\nBut I can't keep out that thought in my head,  that I would break my \"young self's\" promise to never drink, and what kinda person would I be if I couldn't keep a promise to myself? I feel like that teenager would be ashamed of me if he saw me drinking. \n\n\nUsually on New Year's I don't go out so it never really bothered me, but now I'm on a trip with a friend and he usually doesnt drink but only when travelling or special occasions. I'm seeing him having fun and I'm just there, kinda hating myself because I think I'm boring, and maybe drinking would help me loosen up? But then what? When I wake up I'll think about me breaking my own promise for a \"possible\"  good moment? \n\nShould I do it? Should I not? Any advice would be appreciated. If you made it to the end thank you for reading everything. \n\nTldr:I made a promise to myself to never drink when I was about 15, never drank, now 23, seriously questioning if I should break own promise.

I am 43 years old and have been addicted since I was a teenager.  I had tried many times to get better but always found it too difficult to quit.  I never understood why I failed despite trying so many different things.  My wife knew I was watching porn but didn't know how bad it was because I shut her out.  I had been shutting her out our entire 17 year marriage.  A year ago my wife had had enough and threatened to move out and take our children and tell others why if I didn't change.  That was my rock-bottom moment.  That was also the night I quit cold-turkey.    \n\nI promised to change but the promises of an addict are worthless.  I didn't know how I was going to do it but I was determined to do better.  I had the goal of being a better person, husband, and father.  I had seen a therapist about my problem years ago and started using some of those exercises again.  I restarted a personal paper journal and pour out all my negative thoughts and feelings.  I wrote about how disgusted I felt about myself and that I was finally going to take responsibility for my life and not be so out of control.    \n\nI had to finally tell the whole truth to my wife.  It was not easy to break down the walls of secrecy I had built around myself.  For the second time in my adult life I broke down and cried.  She made an interesting observation that my asperger-like symptoms may have made my situation worse.  It is much easier to deal with inanimate pictures than real life people.  I never regretted telling my wife the truth.  We talked a lot and we fought a lot.  I discovered just how much I had hurt her over the years.  I had to show that I was making changes before she was willing to pitch in and support me.  I could have no greater cheerleader, counselor, or complement to help me get this far.  Someday I hope to be able to repay her for all the patience and perseverance she showed me before I finally woke up from my porn coma.    \n\nOn Day 4 of my reboot I started to research this problem.  For the first time I discovered that his is not just a bad habit, but an ADDICTION.  That single truth put my whole life and why I failed so often into perspective.  I also understood that I had been medicating myself with porn for decades.    \n\nMy detox period felt like going though hell.  I was angry, irritable, an seething with raw emotions.  I had no practical coping skills.  I was angry at myself the most for allowing myself to get into this situation.  I finally understood that it was going to take a lot of work to take accountability for my actions.  For weeks I went through an emotional roller-coaster - highs and lows, normal to anger to depression, varying levels of worthlessness, questioning whether it was possible to succeed.  I needed a few small successes to build on.  Some people feel improvements in the first few days.  I was miserable every day for months.  I feared that I would never be able to be happy again.  I was scared that I was too broken to ever get better.    \n\nI discovered that the biggest enemy wasn't porn.  It was myself - the addict version of myself.  Addiction is a monster that will do anything to get what it wants.  Sometimes it uses brute strength, sometimes it is subtle and deceptive.  My addiction knew me better than I knew myself.  It is an opponent that knows all of my strengths and weaknesses and knows just what to say to get past my defenses.  The physical cravings are nothing compared to the mind games you play with yourself and last much, much longer.  I had to get to know myself so that I could fight back more effectively.  I had to continually analyze every thought, feeling, and motivation for everything I was doing.  It was exhausting and tiring, but vigilance was necessary because it only takes one second of weakness to relapse.    \n\nI managed to get though my detox period but still felt depressed and empty.  It was a phase I wasn't prepared for and people didn't write much about it.  I was starting to feel worried that I was never going to feel normal again.  But another Fapstonaut explained to me what I was going through, that it was normal, and to keep going.  Only another addict could have empathized.  I started to have faith that the path I was traveling would eventually lead me to a better place.  Time was needed for my brain to heal.    \n\nI passed my 30 day anniversary, 60 day anniversary, and 180 day anniversary.  Slowly the things I was trying were starting to be a part of me.  I no longer felt like an actor pretending to be a normal human being.  My wife was slowly starting to trust me again and our relationship was improving.  I became an accountability partner to a few people and helped a few couples in the beginning stages of their recovery.  I started to feel that I had something valuable to share.  I no longer felt worthless and empty.    \n\nSo here I am on Day 365.  Am I cured?  Not by a long shot.  Every day is still a struggle.  I was an addict, and now I am merely an addict in recovery.  I will always be an addict in recovery.  I will always have to keep my guard up.  My brain will not allow me to forget how porn made me feel.  Every time I get stressed or anxious I get urges.  The  monster is in it's cage but I feel his arms reaching through the bars trying to get my attention.    \n\nHere's what I'd like to pass on to others.  (I don't have the time or space to thoroughly explain each point but I'll answer any questions).  \n1.  Identify ALL your physical, emotional, and environmental triggers.  \n2.  Write down a detailed abstinence recovery plan.  \n3.  Journal.  \n4.  Do not fight this alone, get others involved - a therapist, wife, girlfriend, accountability partner, parents, etc.  \n5.  Don't trust yourself to be alone with your electronic devices during your detox.  \n6.  Recognize when you are vulnerable and take drastic action to avoid a relapse.  \n7.  Stay out of 'the trance' or 'auto-pilot mode' at all costs.  \n8.  Challenge every excuse or justification to return to PMO.  \n9.  Educate yourself.  Know yourself.  Apply what you learn to yourself.  \n10.  Be willing to sacrifice ANYTHING for a better life.  \n11.  Be patient.  It takes a long time to see progress.  It takes time to reclaim your humanity.  \n12.  Be kind to yourself but do not tolerate failure.  It is NOT impossible to quit.  \n13.  PMO leaves a huge void in you so find ways to substitute as much as possible such a hobby or new interest.  \n14.  Keep using NoFap as an affirmation to stay clean.  Pay what you learn forward.  \n15.  Be humble enough to seek professional help if you need it.  It is not a weakness to ask for help.  \n16.  Reach out to others.  The emotional satisfaction we get from others nourishes the soul and makes porn less appealing.  \n17.  Repair whatever damage you caused to others around you.  \n18.  Forgive yourself for the person you once were.  Start living a new and improved life.  You are now a person who is worthy of love.  \n19.  Our problem is an emotional problem.  Find an anthem song that makes you feel better.  \n20.  It is okay to admit how much you loved how porn made you feel.  Accept that nothing will make you feel the same way.  And be content with living a calm, balanced life.  It will make you feel happier.    \n\nHere are my final thoughts.  Addictions are a nasty thing.  Our addiction is much tougher than others.  It takes one second to feed our addition and throw away all the progress we made.  Addiction invades every corner of our brain and corrupts it.  It is not easy to break free from it.  You have to look inside your heart and find a determination to fight back that is greater than the addiction itself.  It boils down to this - JUST DO IT.  It's easy to say, but it's hard to do.  But it encompasses everything an addict in recovery must do to stay clean.  I hope all of you can join me and share with us your one year anniversary story.","subreddit":"NoFap","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/5lcuwn/coming_out_of_my_porn_coma_day_365/","contest_mode":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2skrn","media_embed":{},"brand_safe":false,"over_18":false,"gilded":0,"edited":1483277205,"author_flair_text":"437 Days","hide_score":false,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true}

Since I have been able to recently identify the problem I have researched it and ways to fix it as I cannot see a physical therapist under my insurance. I found that I also have what I think is anterior pelvic tilt which I suspect is related to my genu valgum. To remedy these issues I have lost a little bit of weight and have been doing planks and other exercises for my gluteus maximus and especially my gluteus medius. Just the other day I\u2019ve realized that the genu valgum does not present itself as much while I\u2019m standing up straight and if I actively try to abduct my knees my, glute medius (I think) contracts and get sore over some time; after about ten minutes this sensation reaches into my hamstring (I really wonder if this is something that's normal for everyone or does it just happen to me because of gluteal weakness). Its when I walk that there is internal rotation of my femur and no matter what I try like, contracting my glutes or tightening my abs, if doesn\u2019t help. This leads me to think that this is an issue that is muscle related rather than anatomical which gives me hope in fixing it. If someone is willing to help me can you give me some information and exercises that I could do to combat this. I'm not trying to particularly solicit a free assessment or treatment but I just want some suggestions so I could try to help myself the best I could since I don't have the means to see a professional.

I am not sure where to begin, so I will just ramble and hopefully it comes together. I am a 21 year old male about to be 22 in a few months. Since late June of 2015, I have had horrible anxiety and possibly (most likely?) very bad hypochondria. On that night in June when things went bad, I went to my sister's house to smoke weed with her and her friends. I had smoked weed religiously for a little over a year before this event, so it seemed like no big deal. I get there, I take literally 2 bong hits and I just didn't feel right afterwards. I was not a \"lightweight\" when it came to weed and I didn't feel uncomfortable in social situations, this one included, but something felt \"off\". After a few hits my heart raced insanely, I went to the bathroom to wash my face off to see if I would feel better, then I immediately had to leave the house. I felt like I was blacking out, my vision was blurry, and I literally thought I was dying. I drove back to my house next door with my girlfriend who also felt strange, and then panicked for 30mins-1hr until the ambulance arrived, who I had called, because my chest hurt soooooo bad. They give me some valium or something and send me on my way. I worked an insanely long shift the following monday and then quit the job because I thought I had something wrong with me. \n\n For a month after this event I became more aware of my body and was convinced for a bit that my heart was always racing. I felt a little dizzy but was otherwise fine other than the health concern. I was trying to unwind for a month or so until I could be calm again and get a new job that I enjoyed more. Somewhere along the line, I went to walmart and then dizzyness out of the blue, went to the ER again, seemingly no issues. \n\nI was fine again for a while until I started getting these extreme aches underneath my ribcage, right at the area where your ribs drop off in your upper abdomen, above my stomach. I still have those to this day. Went the ER and was given a GI cocktail, basically strong as hell antacids, and for 5 mins I felt better but then it was back. Was diagnosed with GERD and took antacids, but it didn't help the pain.\n\nThen, since I had been sick for months at this point, around October my mother mentioned the possibility of me having the autoimmune disorder that she has, Sjogren's syndrome. A few days/weeks after mentioning this, I wake up with a swollen neck and can't turn it all the way, I feel like I have strep throat, and my submandibular salivary glands are swollen as hell. I also started feeling like I had POTS syndrome. When I lied down my heart was normal paced, when I stood it went haywire.\n\nI have had many more symptoms since then on and off but the ones that stick the most that seem debilitating to me know is the pain in my upper abdomen, some heartburn, air hunger all the time, extreme stress, swollen salivary glands and lymph nodes that hurt more/swell more when stressed and ache for hours, depression, agoraphobia to an extent but not severe, and I just feel awful. I assume I am a hypochondriac now but the pain feels so real. I don't know how to stop what I assume is muscular clenching in my upper ribs, I don't know how to calm my swollen salivary glands, and I don't know how not to obsess about my symptoms. I don't feel like physically the weed night destroyed me, but mentally I am not even close to the same person. This all happened 3 months after I turned 20 and in 3 months I am 22. I am seeing a therapist but cannot shake the fact that something is physically wrong with me, maybe autoimmune or something, because the physical symptoms won't subside. What the hell can I do to get my life back? I used to play video games for stress relief, now they stress me out/I can't focus because brainfog. Books I can't focus on/get in to. I play instruments and can't for the life of me progress on them because I get frustrated too easily. I have anger issues now too because I am so scared I am going to die and nobody knows what is wrong with me. If I think rationally, I guess anxiety could cause all these things, but it feels so real. I am terrified and I am the shell of the person that I used to be. I enjoy nothing, I am constantly changing my diet and lifestyle to try and cope, nothing seems to help me much so far. Social media is so toxic, multiplayer games are so toxic, etc. There are general things I could do like eat less junk food or clean the house more, but I try to do everything to such extremes. My anxiety makes me want \"all or nothing\" I guess. If I think about eating less crap food, I feel like I should never touch a beer or a joint(which I don't anyway because I would panic SO hard), makes me want to go vegan and never watch porn again, and just be a perfect saint of a person who makes no risks and doesn't enjoy life. I am rambling, I am sorry, what the hell can I do to get my life back. Any advice is very much appreciated. Would hypochondria ACTUALLY make my salivary glands swell up because my mind is convinced I have an autoimmune disorder? How do I stop it? :(''\n\nTL;DR- Used to be normal, now I am anxious and probably a hypochondriac, what the hell can I do to be normal again and enjoy life?","archived":false,"media":null,"suggested_sort":null,"score":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"is_self":true,"link_flair_text":null,"hide_score":false,"edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"gilded":0,"media_embed":{},"brand_safe":false,"over_18":false}

I am going on 2 years clean and I am finally mentally stable, so I don't want to risk that. \n\nI got my IUD in August 2015, cramps for a couple days, bleeding for over six months, sometimes heavy sometimes light. I began to get regular periods which came with intense, breathtaking cramps on my lower left side, like my hip. My periods lasted over seven days and they were frighteningly heavy. Today I went to put my Diva Cup in, and my IUD fell right into my hands. Does anyone have experience with this? Is it possible that it was not put in correctly? I need birth control ASAP and I did like the Paragard because I don't have to worry about it, so I am open to another IUD. I would also be willing to try other options, but I am concerned with weight gain, mood swings, and worsening my already bad acne. Does anyone with a relatively similar background have any recommendations? Any insight is greatly appreciated. I will be seeing a doctor after the holiday weekend.

I've tried searching for jobs and applying but I can't find any.\n\nRoughly a week and a half ago, I broke my ankle while out taking pictures at a local nature preserve. I tripped over a low-cut tree stump that was hidden under the falling fresh white snow. I was rushed to the hospital ER and operated on the following day where the put 2 plates and some pins in my ankle. A few days after that, I was sent to a local old-age home in my hometown to finish my rehab. I've been stuck here doing rehab ever since. My first appt. with the foot dr isnt for a week and then I'll know how everything is going.\n\nI feel very frustrated being in this place and it drives me insane. Luckily I have a private room (it's semi-private but nobody is in the room with me) and they allow me to keep my door shut all the time. I have trouble with sleeping and they give me NYQUIL at night to help calm me down. \n\nPersonally I would like to leave tonight but I have a \"non weight-bearing\" status on my foot and can't do anything at home yet. I'm learning to hop around on one foot and use a walker and everything but it is taking a lot of time. I'm very impatient sitting in this home though and wish I could do something (or my dad would do something) to get me to come home however since he's 80, he wants me to stay in here for a while to get better as well.\n\nI constantly feel as though my life is worthless and this tragedy is just the latest in a long long line. I'm not sure how I can get my life back on track and I've talked to a counselor before for several sessions but really haven't come up with much in terms of solutions.

I went back today and right off the bat we started flirting. I wasn't very good at it, was pretty nervous and idk if anything will come of it but still. I wrote my number down on the receipt I gave back to her, which I'm starting to doubt was a good decision vs asking for hers, but too late now to worry about it too much.

Initial trouble with assembly due to bad machining QC; 1) Screw hole cutouts not aligned, fabric over the washers, ended up losing them inside the chair on the first screw I removed. 2) Backrest barely fits inside the latches, needed to pull them out to get it in and they dig hard into it. 3) Handle covers for the adjustment mechanisms not going on; pushed as hard as I could and one went 75% of the way and the other went 50%.\n\nAfter I finally got it assembled, I figured I'd give it a week to see if I liked it before getting rid of my old chair.\n\nDay 3 and I already can't stand the damn thing.\n\nFirst off, the cushion material.  It's EXTREMELY firm, to the point of being uncomfortable after a period of time. The instant I sit on it it's just an \"oh god\" reaction, because I expect it to be soft but it's like I just sat on the floor. Maybe this extreme firmness will stop the seat from being flattened in a month like my other chairs, but at this point I just have to sit on a pillow if I really want comfort, which is very annoying.\n\nFor the headrest, it's actually uncomfortable to lean against because of the hardness.  I'd rather slouch and lean against the material on the backrest just below the headrest since that is softer.  It also sticks out too much, and unlike the other chairs there's no way to remove it.\n\nAlso, the leather material the chair is covered with heats up quite quickly.  While fine in the cold season as it is now (it's cold when first sat in too), this is still a problem, and will be a big problem in the summer.  Beyond temperature, it just feels a bit uncomfortable.  I'd prefer a softer leather or a cloth material.  Right now, I have to change position every so often, preferably to a cooler spot.  (It also smells a bit; how long does it need to outgas?)\n\nThe armrests.  Are they even armrests?  It feels like they're there \"just because\".  They're **absolutely atrocious**.  They're very short and much too wide so they get in the way constantly. They can't be lowered enough (ie; I want them out of the way). The material is much harder than the seat, it feels like wood covered with a thin towel.  And the fucking wobble, oh my god.  They're EXTREMELY loose and I can't even adjust my chair without them coming out of place, be it rotating or sliding, let alone make any sort of vibration (ex. leg tapping) or else they both go crazy with noise. Every time I adjust my sitting position and put my weight on the armrest, they slide out, making me lose balance.  I can adjust them with my pinky ffs; that's how loose they are.  I'm thinking of removing them because they're so bad despite needing armrests sometimes.\n\nThen the pull-out piece of the backrest.. It's not secure at all, it keeps moving and making that leather rubbing noise.  Not only is the noise annoying (overwhelms the sound coming from my speakers), but the constant movement of it when I rest against it is also irritating.\n\nAnd more of the backrest.. it's not even fixed securely.  There's wobble when I pull on it, it tilts forward and back, making more rubbing noise too at the bottom. The screws are secured as tightly as I can turn them, but that doesn't matter.  It's always awkward when I try move the chair around.\n\nSeemingly the only good thing about the chair is that it's big.  My old chair had about the same cushion size, so I purchased the Classic series as I don't tend to sit 'normally' very often; I like having lots of seat space (I'm 5'5 100lb).  Turns out, this was a mistake, because the way the chair is designed it wants you to fit in it like you're sitting in a chair.  It is impossible to sit comfortably in a standard sitting position.  The back pillow helps, but that's also obnoxious because it's an attachment and keeps moving, not to mention was a PITA to even attach. It's also not quite tall enough.  And even if I do get into a reasonable position, the headrest is terrible as I said above.  Basically, there's no real comfort to be had no matter how I sit.  My bum is sore right now, I've sitting for about 10 hours total today (average day is 12-18).\n\nThe tilting mechanism.. I can barely tilt the chair.  To get the entire thing to tilt, I have to push on my desk with force enough that the chair is lifting up and/or sliding backwards, or slam back on the backrest, which I do normally when changing positions, which results in unintentional tilt making everything feel loose. (Still has wobble when locked) And it only tilts like 10\u00b0 at most.  The backrest tilt is fine (like a car seat), but it doesn't go 180\u00b0 like I saw in every promotional video and review for years, it's more like 135\u00b0. (There will definitely be no 'sleeping' in the chair..)  And actually, when the backrest is tilted back, the chair as a whole becomes a lot easier to tilt, so there's that.\n\nAnd the lift mechanism.. The chair doesn't go as high or low as my old one.  And when I sit down or get up, it makes an awful noise.. unless the chair is lowered all the way.\n\n\nBasically, the whole thing is a piece of the crap.  My $99 Staples chair was better quality and comfort.  I paid $400 for this.   If my old chair wasn't falling apart, I'd have just gone back to it already.  I needed a replacement months ago, so at this point I'm desperate.\n\nI don't even know what to do now.  A 20% restocking fee is completely absurd.  There was no way for me to test any of these chairs before purchase; I just looked up as much info as I could. I did see some complaints about these types of 'racing' chairs, but I didn't expect the chair to be *this* bad for me.  I want to see if a smaller chair is better for me but I can't justify gambling on it.\n\nI'm just lost at what to do.","archived":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/dxracer/comments/5ld4ts/extremely_dissatisfied_with_my_chair_classic/","subreddit":"dxracer","subreddit_id":"t5_30gng","contest_mode":false,"media":null,"suggested_sort":null,"score":6,"author_flair_css_class":null}

Overall, very lonely after college ended and the ease of socialization vanished after graduating when I moved back to my very rural hometown.\n\nI have recently graduated from college with a respectable degree in a STEM field. I have a handful of friends I know that would bend over backwards for me (even if I don't live near them anymore), and I would do likewise for them. I have a loving family who are helping me get by until I find a job, and overall I maintain that I have a positive outlook for the future. Except, I'm not sure I do completely. \n\n I need to set the stage. Throughout high school I was a shy, awkward, and a slightly chubby band kid. I would go home everyday and spend countless hours wasting away in front of a computer or TV playing video games. In college, I didn't fare much better. I attended a community college to save money, so I missed out on those quintessential \"college freshman and sophomore years\". Community College is NOTHING like what I experienced at a normal 4-year university. My junior and senior years were much better in terms of socialization and having a college experience. I moved in with roommates who I got along great with. I was still chubby, awkward, and shy but I got out more once I found I was around people my own age. I didn't necessarily get in shape, but I went to a gym for the first time and began to feel better about myself socially, physically, and mentally. Those two years were awesome. I made friends, lived around thousands of people within 4 years of my age, and I actually had a social life! \n\nHowever, the one thing that never seemed to happen for me was a romantic relationship. In HS, I had one GF for 7 months my junior year. It was my first GF, and it was a toxic relationship. I broke up with her after I walked in on her hooking-up with another guy. And this was after she told me she \"wasn't like that\", and I respected her wishes and didn't try to do anything that made her feel uncomfortable. Needless to say, this hurt me on a deeply emotional level and explains where a lot of my trust issues with girls stems from. Once bitten, twice shy. Fastfoward to my last semester of college.\n\nI run into a girl I had a class with the semester before. We get to talking and flirting again, and for the first time in ~5 years I work up the courage to ask a girl on a date. Much to my own surprise and pleasure, she was ecstatic about it and say yes! We went on 3-4 amazing dates and everything seemed like it was looking great. Me and her were smiling the whole time, and were talking and laughing for hours on end. On one date in particular, things get frisky. I am 23, and still a virgin at this point. Things escalate and we go to have sex. However, due to my own anxiety about 'FINALLY loosing that V-card', I got performance anxiety and couldn't perform. She was nice about the experience though, and we talked it out, and she shared deeply personal things about herself as well. To my surprise, that same night, she asked to make it official (BF/GF). I agreed, and we both spent another hour or two on cloud nine cuddling before she had to leave.\n\nThis is where in my head I should have raised my own red flags about getting into a relationship, as I was graduating and moving back to my small rural town hours away in ~a month and a half from then.\n\nThe next month was amazing though. For the first time in my life, I had a GF who really enjoyed to be around me, and talk to me. It was new to me to have a girl in my life who wanted to know how my day was, and wanted to talk about it and vice versa. We didn't get to spend nearly as much time together as I would've liked due to the fact we were both extremely busy (we were both double majors, who were both getting two science degrees). However we still went on dates, etc, any chance we got or could afford to make. Near the end of the month, she asked me out of the blue to go to her families birthday dinner for her father at Chris Ruth's. I was a bit hesitant at first because 1) it seemed early to meet her parents, and 2) I knew that Chris Ruth's isn't exactly cheap.(Think suit and tie dining type place). However, she said it would mean a lot to her, her parents wanted to meet me because she talked to them a lot about me, and that they wanted me to come as well. I agreed, knowing that it seemed important to her, and that considering how well we clicked, it was likely I was going to meet them at some point anyway.\n\nDinner went great, and they loved me. Me and my GF went back to my apartment after dinner and decided to watch a movie. We started to get frisky again (second time now), and to make a painfully embarrassing and awkward experience short, I had performance anxiety again as I got inside my own head (again). This time she wasn't as empathetic though and it seemed like she was shutting down. Again, to make a long story short, she basically put up a mental barrier and didn't seem to listen when I tried to explain it was me, and I was just getting inside my own head. And that it was in no way her! It was in the couple minutes before she stormed out though, that she told me she was clinically diagnosed bipolar and hadn't taken her meds that day. Needless to say that took me off-guard, but I took it well and told her that it didn't matter to me, and that I'm still willing to make it work because I cared. She left in a hurry, unwilling to talk, and the next morning she texted me saying that she couldn't be in a relationship. \n\nI went from being open and optimistic about talking about the issue, to instant panic attack. The next couple weeks were brutal for me emotionally, to be completely honest. The breakup was the last thing I had expected to happen, and she acted as if I never existed in the weeks after. I tried to get her to meet in person to talk about it once the day after we broke up, but she rejected the idea after telling me she still thought the world of me but didn't think it was a good idea. Despite the circumstances I handled the situation maturely I thought, and respected her wishes. Since then we haven't spoke once, and all social media ties have been severed. It's essentially like we broke up, deleted all evidence, and never spoke again. To this day, I have no idea if the timing of the relationship was just wrong, my performance anxiety was to blame, or she genuinely just felt overwhelmed with life, school, and her mental illness and didn't want to throw a relationship into that mix before it got more serious. Regardless though, I am over it and realize it was probably for the better as I do not live near my college town. And there was a small chance that I actually got a job in that town specifically. But the whole ordeal/relationship just made me aware of a large overarching anxiety of mine.--- \n\nFastfoward 3 weeks, and I graduate. I receive my diplomas, move back to my home in an isolated and small rural town, and begin the job search. The job search has, and continues to be very slow as many of you are aware of, I'm sure. I spend my week days doing the same routine: I wake up, work out, and apply to a couple of jobs. Beyond that, I have NOTHING to do. I refuse to play video games/ binge Netflix because I'm terrified I might fall back into old tendencies and old habits die hard. If that happens, I definitely won't get out as much. And that's the last thing I want or need, seeing as that break-up/relationship made me aware of one thing. I'm unbelievably lonely and I am craving a genuine relationship with a girl. \n\nThe issue is though, my town is full of nothing but farmers, fields of tobacco/cotton/corn, and old people. Needless to say the dating pool of girls is very close to nonexistent. And the girls there are, are NOT attractive to me personally. I live in a country farm town, but I have city tastes. As I think about this, it starts to give me a lot of anxiety. I realize now that I will never be around so many attractive girls my age again, and that scares me shitless. My parents talked me into getting an online dating profile, but so far that has produced mostly local girls, 80-90% of whom I have almost no attraction to. The ones that I am interested in though, are NOT local live hours away. Maybe I'm just being naive, but I don't want to start a relationship with someone if they live hours away. That makes going on dates difficult, and I'd like to see them weekly if we are going to work towards a relationship. \n\nI don't know. This post doesn't even begin to explain the anxiety I'm trying to deal with in terms of dating. I could rant on this much more I feel like. On top of that all, none of my HS friends live here anymore so my parents are my only human contact for the most part. I am just lonely. Also, I promise I'm not as pessimistic as this post makes me sound! I just needed to vent somewhere to try and help organize my thoughts, and if anything, it might be helpful to get a 3rd party perspective on my dating issues.

Trust me, I love absolutely degrading myself and a lot of rough ideas but if you can't be friendly or respectful outside of those moments then I'm not interested.\n\n**Kinks**\n\n* I'm very submissive and enjoy pet-play, collars and serving. If we write a story... part of the story will involve you giving me a nose ring and maybe a butt plug.\n\n* I have a very strong oral fetish, swallowing is great! Spit and watersports are extra great!

However I'm not a very emotional man and this show has made me feel and it hurt but i loved it. I'm not used to the emptiness from finishing a phenomenal anime probably from being too jaded. If allowed I'd like to sort through my feelings for it in this post and make it anything but a generic recommendation. Thank you for your patience. \n\nThis post means nothing without a small history from myself so bear with me. I'm currently in the army and that entails a lot of moving around in the training part of it before being sent to a duty station. In this I made a friend from basic training and we stuck together all the way through AIT (job training) and through this i had a good friend who i spent most of my time with. We even went to the airport together when it was time to move to our duty stations. I hadn't thought much about it up until he was walking away to board his flight and being the manly man i am i didn't burst into tears there i shed my manly tears in a bathroom stall before realizing i didn't have time to stop there i had a flight to get on myself. Now I'm 3 and a half years in and I'm moving to a new duty station soon and currently grappling with the reality that our steak night we've had every Friday for the last 3 years is coming to an end. These people that I've spent a big part of my life with (the best id argue). We are about to be separated and scattered to the wind as we move on to different parts of our lives. That last part there is why I'm being slowly eaten inside by a bottomless pitt of grief and is my current frame of reference when finishing the second season of Sound Euphonium and remembering how much it hurt to say goodbye.  \n\nIf you've seen it great if not what the hell are you doing here go watch both seasons because this last part is about to spoil the final talk between Asuka and Kumiko. [Sound Euph. S2](/s \"Kumiko and Asuka share a final talk that brought me to tears. Kumiko divulges how she felt at first when meeting Asuka and then that she has come to love her. Kumiko exclaims \" But... But now I'm lonely\" and \"I don't want to say goodbye\". Both feelings that im not a stranger to.\")\n\nIn closing this exchange hit me like a ton of bricks as the combined repressed feelings of having to say goodbye and coming reality of having to start over again in a new place begin weighing heavy on my conscious. I'd also like to apologize to those of you looking for an in depth look at the themes of the show rather than a sad weeb talking about his feelings and the anticlimactic end to the post though at this point its more like a small life story. I'd like to do more in depth stuff in the future with this show and others but I'm still learning the reddit ropes. Enjoy the post ladies and gents and I'm looking forward to hanging around the sub.\n\nEdit: I'd like to add I'm very interested in the human connection between your human experience and your favorite 2D avatar and i think that'll be my primary focus for a while. Feel free to share any scenes that resonated with you and what experience or circumstance helped you make that connection.

We've been dating for 5 months this Wednesday. It's a great relationship and I'm glad I'm in it. Anyways, I'm living my happy life and one night I'm sitting on the couch with my BF and my phone dings. It's a text from my ex, strange enough. \n\nI was very confused as to why he was texting me because we've been broken up for a year now. Yeah, we see each other everyday at school because I have two classes with him and we have the same friends (we're in band) so of course I sit with my friends and him at lunch; but we only speak two words to each other. \n\nWhen we first broke up, I was the one wanting to be friends right away and trying to contact him everyday. He ignored me over text message, and even in real life. Avoided me even. So I let it go, quit trying, quit caring, and here I am now! Completely over him, and wanting him out of my life. \n\nAnother thing I forgot to mention, he has a girlfriend. They've been dating for a year now. (Got together a month after me and him split.) I'm assuming he's happy in the relationship he's in, but the way things have been going for the both of them lately, she's acting like she'd rather fly solo than as a duo. The only reason why I know this is because the two of them sit in front of me at lunch and bicker and fight daily. \n\nWe only texted for maybe 5 minutes, and all it was was him basically thanking me for giving him something 2-3 years ago. I didn't even remember I gave him the thing anyways. \n\nWhy is he all of a sudden trying to get into my life again? I'm so confused, but I do overlook/overthink things a lot of the time so I could just be doing that.\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Ex sent me a text message after a year of no contact.

Literally, years I have been playing around with no luck. One of the big things standing in my way was my desire to involve my mom in picking my new name, but when I finally tried to breach the topic (over a year after coming out to her initially) she basically said that my transition hurts her and she wants nothing to do with it, so I'm free, I'm on my own. This year my New Years resolution is to finally pick a name, but I'm gonna try to get a bit of a head start and go ahead and make a post here. This probably is only the first of several posts I'll make, but I'd like to get feedback/suggestions from what I have now.\n\nA little about me: I'm 20 years old, born and raised in Atlanta. I currently go to school in Wyoming, and I study Russian and Anthropology (esp Archaeology.) I used to be really big into band but have since sort of backed out; marching band and music in general are still pretty important to me though, and my main instruments are tenor sax, sousaphone/tuba, and accordion. I'm also really into language (esp Russian, Latin, and German), politics, and history. I'm kinda short, and am somewhat regularly told I look like Gerard Way, especially since I have started taking testosterone. I'm kind of into like, fandoms in general I guess, I just can't even remember the last time I was really involved in a specific fandom. Steven Universe maybe? I've always loved Star Wars I guess, and Dragonriders of Pern, and I play a lot of video games, especially RPGs.\n\nAt this point there aren't any names I'm particularly passionate about as first names, so I'm trying to look back on the names I've considered from a more pragmatic perspective that fit my criteria even if I'm not madly in love with them, because at this point I don't expect to find a name I'm madly in love with. A name that works in Russian would be great but not a requirement. That list is **Levi, Jasper, Damien, Joachim, Gerard, and Evan.** \n\n* Levi was my favorite back when I first realized I was transgender, and would probably be the easiest to make official because a lot of people, including all my high school teachers and friends as well as some of my family members and my advisor in college know me as Levi already. But my last name starts with L and I don't love the alliteration, I've tried out the name a lot and I don't think it feels quite right, and the source I originally got the name from that made me like it so much has fallen out of favor with me, so it's now a negative connection. I'm also a little concerned with how much more popular Levi is now than when I was born.\n\n* I read the Twilight series when I was in 5th grade and fell in love with the name Jasper. As soon as I read it I started using it as an online alias and my name in video games and stuff. I'm not ashamed to admit that I still think Jasper is a great character and a great name, but like, I don't like knowing that I got my name from as embarrassing of a series as Twilight, even if no one else knows it. Plus, like with Levi it got a lot more popular than I think I'm comfortable with, and also I'm concerned with people thinking I got it from Steven Universe.\n\n* I used to be big into online roleplay stuff, and Damien was one of the names I reused a lot. I still think it's a great name, but it doesn't really have any nicknames, and I have trouble imagining myself taking an adult named Damien seriously, so I'm concerned others wouldn't take me seriously. I'm also worried it's an Edgy\u2122 name, you know? If definitely feels like one to me.\n\n(Note: the other big name I used a lot in roleplay was Alex, either for Alexander or Aleksei, because *A Clockwork Orange* was and is my favorite book, but I personally know a lot of Alex's so I wouldn't want to be one.)\n\n* When I was a sophomore in high school I had to do a project for AP European History on an obscure figure for World War II. Everyone else was doing Soviets, so I tried to buck that trend and find an obscure Axis figure, and ended up doing my project on a guy named Joachim Peiper, mostly because I *loved* his name. I still love his name, but I worry about pronunciation (I prefer yo-ah-k(h)eem to wah-keem), and also, like, I don't want to name myself after a Nazi. Even if I'm just happening to take a name that coincidentally I learned about from a Nazi, and even if no one ever knows, I would know, and I don't like that. I have considered Joey as a nickname, and I really like that.\n\n* Like I said, I get comments semi-often that I look like Gerard Way. My current partner's opening line was basically \"you look like Gerard Way, and I love Gerard Way.\" It's a running joke with some of my friends. And out of this joke developed me considering the name Gerard. It's got an old-fashioned flair I love, it's uncommon and probably not gaining traction any time soon, I like Gee as a nickname (and also have seen Rary/Rory, which I like a lot.) I've been a fan of MCR for half of my life at this point and even if I'm definitely growing out of their music I still have a ton of respect for Gerard Way as a person. My biggest concern is that I worry that it's an uncle name. Like it was solidly in the low 200s for a couple decades in the 1900s, peaked at #177 in 1954, and dropped into the 500s by the 80s. Two of my uncles were born in 1954, and most of my aunts/uncles were born late 40s early to mid 50s, so that's prime uncle age for me. I'm not sure if its exact age makes it kind of dopey/stodgy.\n\n* Evan is weird for me cause it was pretty popular the year I was born but I don't think I know or have ever known a single person named Evan. I  don't think I have ever heard this name said out loud in real life. The familiarity yet complete absence of the name Evan for me is almost unsettling, and I kind of love that. But the only reason the name has ever occurred to me as something to consider is because of scene king Alex Evans, so again with the embarassing source for names! I'm also not sure how much I really like the name and how much of it is just \"I *cannot* believe this name is not already taken by someone I know.\"\n\n**Other things I've considered**\n\nI really like the idea of having a double barrel name and/or going by initials, but struggle to find actual names to use. I've locked in on a middle name, which is one syllable and starts with a T (for reference we'll pretend it's Tate), so I could do something like Gerard Tate \"GT\",  or Jasper Tate \"JT\", or I'm definitely open to the idea of two middle or two first names. For example I really like the intials R.C. as a name, so R___ C_____ Tate. For R names I like Raphael and Rhett, but I wouldn't want to go be either alone, only in initials. I also like non-initial double barrel names, I just have trouble finding one I like specifically for myself because I really don't feel like a John, so all the ones that feel standard to me (John Paul, John David, John Paul David, John Michael, John Baptist, John Luke, John Thomas, John Tucker) are out. I do like James and Jack. Michael is out in any form because it's my dad's name and my brother's middle name.  I've considered Jack Ryan because I think it flows nicely, neither are names I specifically care for separately but I quite like them together, and J.R. are good initials, but 1. I know a Jack Ryan, actually. I'm not particularly close to him but we do have a mutual friend who I live with and probably will be living with for a couple more years, so that makes it weird. Also, admittedly I got it from Bioshock. So. You know. Name sources kill me.\n\nSo yeah!

I spent a few years of my life living off grid with the old ones on a few different reservations (btw most people on the rez had and do have modern conveniences but I stayed with older folks who shunned most of those modern conveniences).\n\nI am trying my darnedest to NOT bring in my \"Christian\" and \"Native American Spirituality\" world view into Heathenism.\n\nI only find it the most difficult when the subject of LandVaettir (land wights)  spirits of the land, when that subject comes up.\n\nIt has been difficult for me to \"find a way\" as far as land wights go.\n\nI'm trying to throw in as much as \"what is on my mind\" into this one posting without making into a book, but I find that difficult as well. In fact .. THIS *is* the short version :-)\n\nSo, I have begun to read, I have listened to podcasts like HeathenTalk and Raven Radio.\n\nI have the beginnings of a home altar-meditation place, and I am soul searching (best way I can describe it) for rocks ... with which to build an outside offering altar place by my favorite tree next to my house. I will let the rocks talk to me or present themselves to me ... but see now we are getting into UPG  :-) so ignore that if you like.\n\nI feel that I am a very spiritual person and close to nature, though I feel I should be closer than I am, I feel that I am closer than most Non-Earth, Non-Ancestral faith types out there, but that's just my opinion.\n\nI know I have a lot of reading to do and I know I should \"hook up\" with a group, but I had to take time to look for a group that I could agree with.\n\nI am straight but not anti-gay and in fact I have gay friends, so, any group that would ban gays is out with me.\n\nWell, I don't know that I should have introduced myself and put myself out there in this way, but I just did, I know that anything I do or say is \"fair game\" and that is just, as the Irish say \"Fair Play\". So have at it, tear my words to pieces, do what you will. I just did what I felt like doing.\n\nThis is too long and I don't blame people for ridiculing it or ignoring it. Anyway, this is where I am at... much being quiet and much study and much group activity is in my near future.\n\nHail The Ancestors!  Hail the Heathen People!  Hail the Spirits of the Land!\n","archived":false,"subreddit":"AskAHeathen","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAHeathen/comments/5lde49/tldr_an_oldie_but_newbie_am_i_doin_it_right/","contest_mode":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_35mri","title":"TL;DR an Oldie but Newbie: Am I doin' it right?","secure_media_embed":{},"author":"isengarf","secure_media":null,"domain":"self.AskAHeathen","num_comments":3,"id":"5lde49","quarantine":false,"hidden":false,"stickied":false,"retrieved_on":1489388761,"thumbnail":"self","created_utc":1483242514,"locked":false,"spoiler":false,"distinguished":null,"link_flair_css_class":null}

I'm 21 and he just turned 65. We've been driving in an unfamiliar area that's hilly and it was rainy and dark just now while he drove. \n\nWhile I get the conditions aren't ideal just now, throughout our trip his driving has actually scared me a few times. Just today he's cut off two people, driven down the wrong side of the road once and almost gone down the wrong side a second time. This was all during the day, excellent conditions, etc. and to my knowledge he's not having any health or vision problems. \n\nOn our way home tonight it was rainy, dark, and the roads were hilly, so caution was necessary, but he was going half the speed limit, not slowing down fast enough, and making poor judgement calls when making turns. \n\nI tried to tell him that his driving was making me uncomfortable, but he didn't want to hear it and started to get irate with me for talking about it. I asked if he's been feeling ok today, he said yes, then I said \"I only ask because I'm not feeling comfortable with your driving right now.\" He didn't like that, asked if I would rather drive and I said yes. He said that's not going to happen and ended the conversation then and there. \n\nMy driving is great, I've never had a ticket, been in an accident, or damaged my car. This trip I've seen him making judgement calls and mistakes that have either been unsafe or extremely dangerous. I'm not a nervous person and it takes a lot to make me uncomfortable, but this is the first time I was tense and anxious while driving with him. \n\nI'm going to bring the conversation up with him again tomorrow when we're driving home, preferably while I'm driving. I don't want it to turn into an argument, but he's the type of person who doesn't take criticism or confrontation well. \n\nThanks for listening, feel free to chime in, I'm gonna need it.","gilded":0,"media_embed":{},"brand_safe":false,"over_18":false,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"hide_score":false,"edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","created_utc":1483242550,"locked":false,"spoiler":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"id":"5lde6o","num_comments":4,"domain":"self.whatsbotheringyou","secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Dad's driving","author":"Otter_Baron","retrieved_on":1489388762,"hidden":false,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false}
