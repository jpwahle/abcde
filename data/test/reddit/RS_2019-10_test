Most are silly, some are seemingly prophetic. I don't know what to think or whether or not I should be concerned. \n\nLong time lurker here with a relatively fresh account because (I'm sorry) I'm scared of professional backlash. Please don't hold that against me -- I have a wife and two kids who depend on the business I've built, and I can't allow whatever is going on here to impact them more than it already has.\n\nSo, this has been going on for a few years now. I'm 41, MWM, with no history of paranormal activity or anything like this prior to early 2016. There were no unusual situations in my life, no upheavals or notable events, positive or negative, in the days and weeks preceding what I'm about to describe. Beyond that, I honestly don't even know enough about this stuff to know what to consider, so please ask away if you have questions or suggestions. I have done a pretty good job keeping a journal throughout the entire time frame, so I can probably look back and provide context as needed. I appreciate any help you can offer.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, I've been having \"dreams\" that happen in the back of my mind while I'm awake and active. It's very hard to explain, because it's honestly like nothing else I've ever even heard of before, and it's certainly like nothing else I've ever experienced. \n\nIn most cases, I'm almost completely unaware it's happening *while* it's happening. I'll be working on a client's project, reading a book, or driving, and there's a \"movie\" playing in the back of my mind. It never distracts me or interferes with what I'm actively doing. But if I try, I can kind of \"slide back\" and watch the movie, and it's incredibly detailed and intense. Since I became aware of it, it's occasionally been irritating only because I'm naturally curious and find myself getting sucked into these mental movies when I should really be doing other things, but it's never been involuntary or aggressive in any way. \n\nAs far as content goes, most of the time it seems like the same kind of nonsense I would expect to see in dreams while I sleep. Stuff that could never happen in real life. The settings and people involved are usually familiar, but I would say 80% of the \"plots\" are just silly. However, in a few cases now, I've \"slid back\" and watched a movie that's  basically come true in real life. Certainly not in every detail, nothing like that. But, in general, my \"dream\" has actually happened within a week or two of when I \"watched\" it.\n\nI'll give you one example of what I mean:\n\nIn November of 2017, my wife and I put an offer in on a house we wanted to buy. At that point, everything about the place seemed perfect, and the owner was seemingly very eager to sell. We (and our realtor) assumed everything was going to move along beautifully. Then, a few days after we put in the offer, I was reading on a Monday evening and noticed a \"movie\" started playing, so I \"slid back\" and watched. \n\nI (my POV) was floating above the back deck of the house we had just offered to buy. The kitchen door slid open and two people I'd never met walked out. The woman was crying, the man was yelling and held a beer can in his hand. They argued for a few minutes about money, debt, child support, and whatnot, then the woman finally said, \"fine, take the fu\\*\\*ing offer, but it's your job to clean this s\\*\\*t out, I'm not cleaning up after your sorry a\\*\\* anymore.\" They went inside, and the \"movie\" faded to black.\n\nThe next day, we received word the offer had been accepted. My wife and I made arrangements to go back to the house, which we'd already visited with our realtor, and made note of all the junk that was still in the house. We let the realtor know we needed everything cleaned out before we would proceed with inspections and due diligence because we needed to be sure the inspectors could get to everything and be thorough. As it turned out, it took nearly four full months for the current owner to finally get around to cleaning out the house to our specifications. Main reason: he was a raging alcoholic and he and his wife were in the midst of a terribly bitter divorce. So, he had a very difficult time arranging for everything he needed to clean the place out. \n\nSo, looking back on that little \"movie\" I watched with the insight I have now (we've been in our new house for well over a year now), I absolutely KNOW, without a doubt, that the people I saw arguing on their porch were the husband and wife we bought the house from. I'd never seen them prior to that \"dream\", but met them at the closing table. It was definitely them. And, I KNEW, prior to being told, that they were having marriage problems and that cleaning out the house was specifically going to be a difficult issue. \n\nGranted, that's not a big deal to anyone but my family. But, here's the thing: since I recognized the occasionally prophetic nature of these \"dreams\", here are just a few of the things I've seen, running like a movie in the back of my mind:\n\n* Greta Thunberg saying, \"how dare you\".\n* President Trump being impeached.\n* President Biden pardoning President Trump.\n* A chemical weapons attack on Las Vegas.\n* A school shooting in Washington D.C. \n\nI'm starting to get scared because there's still almost daily nonsense \"dreams\" as well. It's like, whatever this thing is, it's totally hit and miss. But, when it's a \"hit\", it's serious. I don't even know what to think or do anymore.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Thetruthishere","subreddit_id":"t5_2sntx","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Thetruthishere","subreddit_subscribers":265600,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Waking Dreams -- I Can't Explain This and I'm Not Sure If I Should Be Scared or Not","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Thetruthishere\/comments\/dbkqal\/waking_dreams_i_cant_explain_this_and_im_not_sure\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I just wrote down reasons to remember tomorrow why I want to be sober 1. I want to be a mother and want to see a little mark and Jessica walking around (my husband and My name) 2. I want to be fulfilled and don\u2019t have time to lay around in bed while I could be living .. I am so much more than sleep- I constantly do this and am so depressed when I sleep the days away 3. God gave me an amazing husband who has always been by my side it\u2019s time I do the same 4. I want to live past 35 I have so much left to do what\u2019s wrong with me? When I get sober there is a period of time where I am miserable and the people around me all drink all the time, know I have an alcohol problem but still keep mentioning drinking ughhhh I hate alcohol","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stopdrinking","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7yr","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/stopdrinking","subreddit_subscribers":225073,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Alcoholism Sucks","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/stopdrinking\/comments\/dbkuvn\/alcoholism_sucks\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

From your personal experience, have you experienced positive, lingering side effects once you've stopped? If so, how long after you stopped? \n\nI am nearing the end of my 4 week cycle in approximately two days from now. BPC has met most of my expectations but not all. However, the results it did yield were ***totally*** worth it. Among other benefits, it has dramatically reduced my tolerance to stimulants (instant release adderall in particular) as well as to Alprazolam (Xanax). Between the two it seems to have benefited my benzo tolerance the most (my normal dosage has at least twice the effect it used to). \n\nI am also prescribed propranolol (a beta-blocker medication prescribed to lower blood pressure, high blood pressure runs on my dad's side of the family), and I have read a few studies about BPC-157 and propranolol having extremely positive interactions (especially with respect to reducing damage caused to the liver by chronic alcohol abuse, however I have not drank alcohol for 3 months and did not drink that much alcohol before that, and I cannot really ascertain any positive interaction yet). \n\nIn addition to the tolerance reduction, it has also greatly helped regulate my sleep cycle, and also provided me with lots of mental clarity and creativity (I am extremely passionate about writing. Writing has been my passion since I was in college. I like bringing stories\/topics to life thru words, and writing how I feel is also extremely cathartic for me). Whether I am on stimulants or other cognitive enhancing nootropics or not, I just want to search, discover, explore, and write after each time I inject 250 mcg of BPC subcutaneously. This is a very noticeable cognitive improvement which BPC has provided to me which I am extremely grateful for. The only area that BPC has not fully met my expectations in is my natural energy levels. I was never so naive to think that BPC was going to completely reset everything back to when I was 21 years old (I am 33 now) but I was expecting a little bit of an extra natural physical energy push that I have definitely experienced with other peptides before in addition to the tolerance reduction, but I am happy for what it has accomplished so far and the tolerance reduction effect was 100% worth it in and of itself (trust me, it works for that, I tested it out numerous times).\n\nI have yet to feel the stimulant dampening effects many others report (which seems to be common and only temporary). Wednesday will officially mark 4 weeks that I was on BPC (I took 15 mg total) and I am going to stop for at least 2 weeks to assess things before I even consider starting another cycle again (even tho it's been a wonderful experience). \n\nI am wondering if any of you reading this noticed any lingering effects (positive, negative, anything) after you were done with your cycle. For instance, many people who have taken NSI-189 for 4 weeks straight and then stopped have reported on here that they felt the benefits of the NSI ***significantly*** more AFTER they were off of it versus while they were actually on it. Anyone have a similar experience with BPC?\n\nI'm really curious to know about your experiences so I can compare them to mine!

In short, it's perfect.  Obviously anything that's too good to be true, is.  But I inquired since it couldn't hurt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up to this email and I'm 99.999999% sure it's a scam, but I'm also new to renting, so I don't know if I'm just being overly cautious and really screwing myself out of a deal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\" \n\nHello,\n\nFirst  of all, I think that you noticed the monthly rent price, which is below  the market. The reason for this, is because I already left US, I am now  in United Kingdom and I cannot show you the apartment in person.  \n\n\nThe  reason I haven't managed to rent the apartment before leaving\u00a0 for  United Kingdom is that someone said will rent the apartment and haven't  managed to keep the promise.\u00a0\u00a0I waited for him, but unfortunately  he was unable to get the money in time, so the transaction failed and I  had to leave before I could rent it. Obviously, this experience has  brought me huge inconveniences\u00a0 and left me with a bitter taste so I  prefer to use a worldwide property management company.\n\n**Please note that all the keys are with me in United Kingdom**, because we are overseas,\u00a0 and because of this bitter experience we previously had, I\u00a0 will rent the apartment\u00a0**ONLY\u00a0 by using**\u00a0an International Third Party company called\u00a0**Wimdu (wimdu. com)**.\u00a0  Their website is main focused on short term rentals, but they also have  an NEW service for long term rentals. I used this service last month  when I rented my apartment in London, United Kingdom, and I can tell you  that it was a great experience. Look at their website as reference, but  please know that you will not find my apartment there, as I need to  initiate the transaction before anything.\u00a0  \n\n\n**Wimdu is a very serious company,\u00a0 a\u00a0global company with millions of customers\u00a0(both landlords and renters), their revenue is\u00a0over 100 million dollars\/year.\u00a0\u00a0Their services are similar to the well known Airbnb, reason why they were named the best alternative for Airbnb.**\u00a0In my opinion they offer better services than Airbnb.\n\nUsing  Wimdu\u00a0 involves three parties: me as owner, you as a potential tenant  and Wimdu as a responsible third party authorized to handle this  transaction.\u00a0**Wimdu will handle everything**.\u00a0**Wimdu  works the same way as the escrow account on which you place the deposit  when you rent an apartment, except that instead of a bank, we use  Wimdu. Of course, nobody can take that money until you will inspect the  apartment and sign the lease agreement.**  \n\n\nI understand that this is not a conventional way to rent a place, but\u00a0**please keep in mind that the \"reward\"**\u00a0for following with the Wimdu transaction is a\u00a0**lower monthly rent**.  Also I will pay for all the fees that Wimdu will request for using  their services. Please note that the Wimdu services are necessary only  until you will inspect the apartment and sign the lease agreement, after  that you can deposit the monthly payments directly to my bank account,  or we can setup a payment method that is suitable for both of us.  \n\n\nMy phone number is\u00a0**(taking this out for the post),**\u00a0please  keep in mind that there is a big time difference between us, if I am  not able to respond, I will do my best to call you back asap.  \n\n\n**LET ME KNOW IF YOU ARE STILL INTERESTED IN THE PROCESS**,  so I can provide all the detailed steps of the transaction (I am sure  that many of the questions you have now, will be answered after I will  send you the steps). If you choose to continue, I will do my best to be  as transparent as possible during the whole transaction.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this normal?

It might seem like I'm complaining because I want to control my parent's life, but this is different. I just want them to know that it's really stressful for me to tag along with them every new job opportunity they have. They've had a childhood of their parents picking a place and staying there, I haven't. My entire life has been consisted of, moving to a new place, settling down, meeting new friends, then realizing I can't keep them because \"Hey, we got a better job, and you'll get better schooling\". They don't seem to realize that I'm really being affected by it. I've brought this subject up to them before, but they always say \"we're doing this for a better life\". Sure, it's helping them, but over time, I've become less social and a quiet person in general and they still don't notice. But now the real dilemma, we're moving again. At this point, I'm done, I'm already stressed with school, this is the last thing that I need to hear. I'm already seeing a therapist because of social problems and she can't do anything, and I don't want to bring this up with them because they'll pull the \"better life, better education\" stuff again.

I had a decent childhood, a loving mother, 3 amazing brothers, and a really thoughtful and caring sister; however, these stories are never black and white, as I'm sure most of you know.\nI currently live in indiana, and after spending about 4 years (since I was sixteen) working dead end jobs, I really want to move out of state, and work dead end jobs in a better location, ya know? If I'm struggling here, why not struggle where there's a coast? I'm 21, and have nothing besides my car. Me and my twin still live with our mom, and regretfully I don't have much saved. Not enough for an apartment, but enough to get me and my car to Portland oregon, a looong way from Indiana. I have experince living out of my car, I did so for one of those aforementioned dead end jobs.\n\nHere's some back ground,\n\nMe and my family aren't close, so I feel a lot of pressure when I'm around them simply because I know I should love these people more, but I don't. Never done no wrong doing to me, however, with there being 5 childeren, it was 2-2-1, and I was the 1. I just always had my own thoughts and kept to myself. Always drempt running away and living on my own, even if it was in the woods. Now I'm 21, out of the closet, and really don't feel like I belong? I don't fit in with my family, or my community (basically old people,) and long to be on the west coast, even if its further north than san fransico. The culture and diversity they offer entices me. I dont have a college education, or a savings, but I really want to risk it and take that chance, ya know? I've put it off since I've been only enough to work, and I really regret not saving, but I just feel like lifes too short, ya know? I keep weighing the fact worst comes to worst I just go home, and the fact I'd be living out of my car.

I'm 24 year old Dad, just yesterday it was over with me and his mom. I'll do my best to not turn this to a novel.\n\nI've been exhausted emotionally and mentally for the last few months. Its hard waking up every morning and having to get up but being held back. I felt like I was being knocked down day by day and almost wanted to give up. But my son was my motivation to keep going. His mom, we'll call her \"A\", has been nothing but a great mother, despise what we've been going through I still respect her and will never speak ill of her. \n\n A and I have been going back and forth with talks about what we need to fix in our relationship. It gets draining having to keep doing this. One min, I think we're ok, and we talk and act like we usually do and then bam, something's off. Now the thing is, She's not wrong, we're both not perfect, we have our flaws. \n\nSo I'm a hard working man, I put enough hours of work to provide for this family, it's not a 9-5 job, I usually do 9, 10 hour days. It'll be random. But at one point, days at work were getting longer and I would come home really exhausted, but I'd still have enough energy just to play with my son. No matter how exhausted I am, I go straight to him. But A would have her moments where she would want to have sex, but I'm tired, I can't help it. So it was going on for a while, and finally, I went through her phone because something didn't feel right. I found out she exchanging messages to a co-worker and sent him a video of playing with her breast. I was crushed. Confronted her that same day about it and she tried to justify by saying I wasn't showing any intimacy, I never went out of my way to find something or fuck somebody new. I stayed faithful and didn't talk any other girls besides my close friend \"J\" she's married and we don't have any history of messing around.\n\nIts been in the back of my head for the longest, just recently, she sent a wrong message and I received it, I flipped shit because it seemed sketchy and she was gonna have breakfast with a friend that I never met. I just told her next time let me know, but apparently it was cancelled.\n\nFast forward to now, I'm more exhausted than usual, we almost split and came back together to try and fix things. But it's not working out. We've exchanged enough hurtful words to each other, we said things we never meant to say. But this relationship is getting worst. We had our last talk, she tried to compare me to some friends that I'm not romantic. I acknowledge that I'm not, but I still show my love in ways that may not seem noticable. She says that I'm a great Father, but a horrible BF. As bad as it sounds, I'm fine with that, I love my son to death. No matter how much we have these talks, it just gets shoved under the rug and leave it as be and that's my fault. But even then how much are we just gonna hurt each other if we keep coming together and nothing gets resolved. I'm not mentally ok, my energy hasn't been the same as it use to be and neither has hers, we're just kinda bickering at this point. There's a lot more than what's on here but it's too much to type at this point. Its been a real rollercoaster this year, and I'm ready to make a change by working on my mental health, make changes and grow. It'll start by going to a therapist.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"offmychest","subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/offmychest","subreddit_subscribers":1904269,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Its about time I went to therapy.","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/offmychest\/comments\/dblb2e\/its_about_time_i_went_to_therapy\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

First of all, I would like to wish to you and your family, strength and luck (in whatever definition you give to this word). My English is not a level I wish them to be. I was born in Greece by Greek parents. So, English is my second language. I'll try to analyze the situations I've been in and why your lectures and interviews and videos are so meaningful and helpful to me.\n\nFirst of all, I've done psychotherapy for 5.5 years. From the age of 21 to the age of 26. Right now I'm 28. Violently abusive father, weak and depressed mother. Both grew up in small communities, very far away from electricity, for the second one. Both illiterate in so many ways for the today's world. A few months after I started psychotherapy, I was diagnosed -if you like- as a gifted person and with a high IQ score. I developed my skills in various arts, while I was studying a very specific subject in the field of Engineering, in a university.\n\nMy love for psychology and human behavior, started to get on the line by the age of 5. I was totally bored in kindergarten. So, I started to observe the kids around me. By the end of the year I noticed that their personal expressions was movements and facial expressions of the person that came to get them by the end of the day (caregiver). The teacher that look after me, told my poor mother that \"one day he will be great, in the top minds\" or something like that, i don't really remember or care by now.\n\nThe thing is: the first school for children like me was built in Athens, Greece, in 2008 or 2010. As you imagine in mid-late 90's no one was informed about the term gifted, or knew how to perform an IQ test, in a industrious area near the port. Low quality of life, low education, obsolescent educational system in general.\n\nI was 22.5 years old when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was forced to quit alcohol and marijuana abuse immediately, which you can predict that I started in 15 and it's correct. Then I paused the psychotherapy, by the orders of my \"psychiatrist\" in a public hospital (!). Meaning that I was forced to stop something I needed by the time I was at my lowest, as you can imagine. Having experienced an upper pole, expressed with schizoid shape let's say.\n\nSome day, for obvious reasons, I decided to leave the \"care\" of my psychiatrist in the hospital and join a rehab group, which didn't work. I left this freaking obsolescent place and went back to my initial psychotherapist.\n\nAll and all, in 2017 I closed the therapy. I have managed the bipolar disorder with medication and hard work with the therapist. I might never stop the medication. But who cares? It's safe and it's in its lowest values. I guess my brain works fine again, after physical exercise and studying various scientific subjects. After managing two major violent trauma by my father, by the age of 5, and the psychological absence of my mother because of depression, when I was 10. In 2017 I started a MSc course and now I'm concluding my thesis, which is probably going to be published.\n\nBut, the thing is I got confused on what to do after this and, most importantly, how to do it. This is where you kick in. You gave me exactly the insight I needed for setting my mind and quit abusing video games. You gave me the hope, that if I practice enough and believe in my self I'm going to have the career I want, achieve the goals I set. Maybe, I'll be in a position to get a family if all things set. Maybe, I'll be in a place to teach my subject and speak out the message that even in the most difficult situations, someone can thrive. Despite the abuse. Despite the anger and the medieval methods. \n\nMaybe, one day you will read this and find it funny or lie... Maybe, you will laugh at the idea that flowers can be born out of dirt. But, that's how I like to see the child I was. I like to see it as a flower that grew on a dirty rock. And you are helping this plant, with your work, become more big and start to flourish, for the needs of it's existence. For the needs of the society that gave it nothing but pain and an early parental world that was dark and lonely. \n\nI wish to you strength.\n\nIn one of your lectures, you mentioned that you don't matter much because you are old (in a speech about motivation making the point to your students to carpe diem and set goals). I don't think so. You can be the guidance that the future's great humans need today. You can be their Yoda (or whatever they call it). \n\nThank you so much, for playing that role in my subconscious mind. Thank you so much, for being a teacher. For the energy and all the points about effectiveness. Thanks, for the chance you made me give to myself, to purchase my... existential responsibility.\n\nSincerely,\n\naQuantumProfessor.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"JordanPeterson","subreddit_id":"t5_32jqy","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/JordanPeterson","subreddit_subscribers":201859,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[Letter] Thanks for giving the insight, the hope and the tools","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/JordanPeterson\/comments\/dblqju\/letter_thanks_for_giving_the_insight_the_hope_and\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

When the paramedics got to him he was medically dead for a few minutes. Luckily, they were able to resuscitate him and transported him to a hospital nearby. I was relieved, because there was nothing scarier to me, an eight year old boy, than having a close family member be so close to being gone forever. Or so I thought.\n\nFast forward to a few years in the future. My brother was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury, but we were assured he would regain most of his muscle control after a few years of physical therapy. I was happy, because at the time I figured I'd be getting my older brother back. But as the years went and we aged, I eventually began to notice there was a divide between us. I began to notice I was spending less time with him. I stopped doing the things we used to do together, and eventually realized I was depressed. \n\nFast forward to now, where I'm 19 and realizing for the first time that I can't bring myself to be near my brother. For some reason I don't view him as the same person. What I used to think was depression I now think is a few different mental health problems I have regarding this. So where's the confession? I've never told anyone in my family about this. I'm sure they've picked up something is wrong, as my brother and I haven't had a conversation in years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Older brother attempted suicide, was diagnosed with TBI, I consistently avoid him because I don't think he's really \"there\", never told anyone the whole truth before now.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"confessions","subreddit_id":"t5_2qq6g","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/confessions","subreddit_subscribers":669879,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I can't be near my older brother","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/confessions\/comments\/dblv6q\/i_cant_be_near_my_older_brother\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Reactions are a tad slower, build up requires more precision, defending required an adjustment as well but the gameplay is rewarding. Dribbling and skill moves were the biggest adjustment, learning to use the right stick in conjunction with the left stick in new ways has been difficult for one on one play but im still learning and it is not game breaking. Overall, don't let any potential initial frustration turn you off the game, instead, start on the easiest setting and work your way up, also make use of their great training mode for practice. I'm currently playing on regular difficulty. \n\n\nIMMERSION:\n\n\nThis was my initial concern, lack of licenses. However, since I learned that you could download option files (ps4 and PC only!) to replicate all of the authentic licenses for badges, team names, jerseys etc. I was very excited. Well worth the investment from the guys at PES universe who worked on the file. That said, commentary in game is weak, player faces, although in general are good and some are better than fifa, some are also definitely worse. Intro cutscenes before games are also well done. All in all, the inclusion of the option files make this a worthwhile experience, I won't say it surpasses fifa in this respect but it's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. \n\n\nCUSTOMIZATION:\n\n\nBlows FIFA out of the water in every respect in my opinion. I play sports games regularly, Madden, NBA 2K, NHL and of course FIFA. Each of those games except FIFA allowed you to edit players ratings, positions, abilities etc. PES does the same. It was great knowing that I was free to update Tammy Abraham's rating before I started a Master League file to reflect what I thought was improved form. Even if it was just a couple of overall points higher it was just cool knowing that I had control of it in every way, for every player. You can even change their appearance if they don't have a player scanned face, I followed a tutorial online to make Pulisic look more like, well, Pulisic (surprised he didn't have a scan tbh.) \n\n\nCAREER MODE\/MASTER LEAGUE:\n\n\nThe reason I switched. For starters, it's not broken so that's a win. The selection of a manager with real life avatars is a neat idea but I just picked a generic face that looked a lot like Michael Essien (my favourite player) which was very fitting for my Chelsea team. The cutscenes seem well done, and the dialogue, although not interactive, is a welcome addition. The main hub of career mode is easy enough to follow and the news updates look much better than FIFA. Team management took some getting use to, the UI isn't as intuitive as FIFA but once you learn where to go for formations, selecting lineups, strategies, etc. It's not that bad, not great but not bad. I do love the idea of showing the players overalls as you switch their positions on the team sheet and the idea of an overall team performance rating based on your lineup. I also like the ability to field your best team (based on overalls) with a click of a button. I also enjoy how easy it is to slide player positions around the team sheet as well. \n\n\nTranfers and negotiations took some getting used to, and again not as interactive at FIFA but that's not a bad thing. Theyre straight forward once you get used to it. Youth academy, from what I've seen is not what I expected. I'm still not sure exactly how it works. I know I have a youth squad and I can sign players as a I see fit and they develop in the youth squad but I'm not 100 percent sure what the most effective way is to train them. I'm sure there are plenty of tutorials but as it stands I prefer FIFAS youth system and scouting (I'm also aware of the regen issue in PES, doesn't bother me, at least not yet.)\n\n\nI'm a stat nerd and I absolutely love the database. You can see player stats, either by competition, or overall for the season, for every player, for every league. I love that. In FIFA all you get is the standings for each league in PES you get so much more. I'm the kind of guy who keeps spreadsheets to track career stats, and it's just cool to know that I can see which players are having a great season in La Liga across all competitions even though I'm in the EPL. \n\n\nThere are other neat things like budget allocation, listing your favourite players, management history, and other minor aspects that work in making Master League very enjoyable. I'm 11 games in to my EPL, season and I know that I will play every single game for this season and likely many more to come. \n\n\nOVERALL\/TL;DR:\n\n\nIf youre like me, and you couldn't forgive FIFA for what's happened this year or you didn't want to wait, amd if you have the patience, and don't play on Xbox one, then PES is absolutely worth it. There are still some things that FIFA does better, again I'm more used to their gameplay obviously, their immersion is still better even with PES option files, and the career mode and team organization UI takes a bit of getting used to, but it's a great game. \n\nSo please do yourself a favour and give it a shot. And if Fifa ever patches this joke of a career mode, pick it up on sale later if it still interests you.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"FifaCareers","subreddit_id":"t5_2tzz3","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/FifaCareers","subreddit_subscribers":81159,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My experience switching over to PES 2020","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FifaCareers\/comments\/dblvck\/my_experience_switching_over_to_pes_2020\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

working close to full-time for a national organisation. Without sounding arrogant, I'm a well established, hard working and determined businessman (but that's just one side of me). I go to the gym anywhere from 3-6 days each week and play sport at a semi-professional level, so my body is in great shape. I'm 5'10 with dark hair and blue eyes. Check out these photos if you'd like! [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/SnWIff8](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/SnWIff8)\n\n**KINKS\/EXPERIENCE** \\- I've been involved in a number of dom\/sub relationships both online and in person. Through these experiences I have been fortunate enough to explore a variety of kinks and fetishes. In complete honesty, there is little to no kink that doesn't interest me apart from the really extreme things (blood, scat, etc...). I'm open to finding a sub on a committed or casual level, online or in person, depending on what interests you. On one hand I've had a dedicated online sub for a 12 month period which involved ongoing rules, daily\/weekly\/monthly tasks and webcam sessions and on the other hand I've had an IRL sub who I would meet with as often as possible.\n\nI'd love to hear from anyone who is even the slightest bit interested. I tried to keep it really short so don't hesitate to ask questions. Apart from that, I look forward to putting you to test and dominating you in whichever way I see fit ;)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BDSMpersonals","subreddit_id":"t5_2smyd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BDSMpersonals","subreddit_subscribers":93523,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"20M Ruthless Dom - Seeking Submissive Slut (PICS INSIDE)","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BDSMpersonals\/comments\/dblvms\/20m_ruthless_dom_seeking_submissive_slut_pics\/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}

They're half sisters. I love these girls to death and was excited to see them at a family gathering a few days ago. Now, I grew up with an older brother and I didn't behave like a normal kid, so I have no idea what 13 year old girls are like. If it means anything, I have autism, so that's more difficulty at understanding people (and is probably why I didn't act properly).\n\nI was playing with both cousins since they like to do these imagination games. Everything was going fine until O suddenly starts talking excitedly about how she saw some boys at her school playing a game where they just... slapped each other. Normal dumbassetry. Then without warning, she slaps me in the face. It wasn't full force, but it was enough to really hurt (I have very low pain tolerance).\n\nI'm kind of in shock from it, and she asks if we can play that game--as in all three of us, including little E. I shake my head and O BEGS to slap me. \"Please, please, please? Just once. It won't hurt. I promise.\"\n\nNow, I'm 20, but this girl is almost as tall as me and I'm the most frail person I know. As in, not strong at all, and you can very easily knock me down. So I'm shielding my cheek with my hand, and O turns and lightly slaps E instead. That's when I shut things down.\n\nThen O and E want me to download Tik Tok. Fine, I can just delete it after they leave. But before I do anything, O grabs my forearm with both hands and squeezes hard. I instantly freeze up from the pain and go \"Ow\" to which she happily replies: \"I'm not letting you go until you download it.\"\n\nOver the course of the night, O keeps grabbing E's wrists and twists them. Before I have time to make a move to pry her hands off (I had surgery recently and can't move as fast as I'd like), she lets go. E never cries, but she still squeals in pain. O also jumps on me, hits me, grabs me, and tries to kick me.\n\nNow, being autistic, I don't know what's playful and what's not (also since playful hitting still hurts). I'm used to being beat up by my brother, so I just sat there and took it. I don't mind if she hurts me, but she has a half sister who's six years younger and that concerns me. I said something every time she went for E, but I regretfully didn't say anything to her mom.\n\nIs this normal? I wasn't a violent kid, and I don't think my friends were. O and E don't usually live together, but I bet they see each other often. I'm worried for both their sakes.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationship_advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0cn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/relationship_advice","subreddit_subscribers":2828413,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Is this normal behavior for a 13 year old girl?

I wanted to share my story to see if I could connect with someone that's gone through something similar to mine, so please comment if you can relate to my story.\n \nBack in December of last year , I was out shopping for a Christmas party , and the mood was very happy and light. I was with my youth leader whom I was very close with. We had just set up for our party and then went to cryeleike  to pick her husband up from work. ( it was dark and rainy ) As I was getting out of the car, she pulled the car toward and literally ran my foot over with her Volvo. Now , at the time , I didn't freak out too much , so as to not make her even more upset and guilty feeling for doing it. She offered to take me to the doctors office because I was limping a bit. I refused but the next day I went with my mom. They said it was just a contusion and perhaps a sprain.  Well it seemed to heal in two weeks and I freaked out a lot but was okay overall. In January I went ice skating , where I injured it again. I really freaked out and cried. Fast forward a month later, healed again after just keeping it in a wrap. Well July rolls around and I haven't given my foot a second thought since February so I figured all was well. I was so wrong. Long story short , it started hurting again even though I was just walking about my day and I went to about 4 xrays , all saying that nothing was broken. After my last xray , the orthopedic reffered me to a physical therapy office to do therapy for my foot 2 times a week for a month. Now that that is over , I suppose my foot is almost healed completely,  but my emotional and mental state are not stable.\n\nI feel suicidal and just want the pain to stop. I have such a huge fear of the woman who ran my foot over and that makes everything so complicated as we were so close and she was the only person I had ever truly trusted with anything. Now I don't feel safe telling her anything. Other things that really get me upset are when I'm in public and especially in parking lots and I have this huge fear that she is gonna come out of anywhere and run me over. The flashbacks from that night back in December haunt me every single day , sending me into tears and panic attacks often. Just like tonight. And when I think back to the accident , my mind warps what happened with her having a sinister look on her face while doing it and things like that which really scare me. I have to see her often so this is terrible. I really don't know what to do and sometimes I just think my mind is messed up beyond repair and I should just kill myself. Well , not sometimes,  all the time.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ptsd","subreddit_id":"t5_2qm0x","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ptsd","subreddit_subscribers":42397,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Has anyone else on here gotten ptsd from a freak accident?","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ptsd\/comments\/dbm5z6\/has_anyone_else_on_here_gotten_ptsd_from_a_freak\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

From what I know of my stepdad, he's not really a tolerant guy, especially of people doing stuff outside traditional gender roles. It's honestly kind of why he and my mom didn't get along. He's the kind of person who's okay with other people doing what they want, but has a kind of \"not my kid\" attitude when it comes to these things. \n\nSo the situation was basically that I was in charge of Andy one weekend. and we were playing video games when he asked me to paint his nails blue because he saw that I'd painted mine. Before doing it I basically told Andy that his dad wouldn't like it since people usually think nail polish is for girls, and that kids at school might also make him of him since not everyone is as accepting of stuff like this. Andy said he was okay with that and understood, so I went ahead and painted his nails.\n\nMy mom saw Andy's nails but seemed ok with it. Later on though, when my stepdad saw Andy, she said that he'd gotten really mad and called her, basically asking what she was thinking, and when he found out I was the one who did it, he said that I shouldn't be allowed alone with Andy anymore.\n\nAITA?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AmItheAsshole","subreddit_subscribers":1856019,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA for letting my step brother paint his nails knowing that my step-dad wouldn't like it?","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/dbm6lb\/aita_for_letting_my_step_brother_paint_his_nails\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I've suffered through PTSD, ADD, severe social anxiety, panic attacks, and agoraphobia. All of which is basically due to childhood trauma which I won't get I to here. Also, I still live at home with my mother and have been fully dependent on her for many years now. Thankfully I'm now on psychiatric medication, have been regularly seeing a counselor, and I now feel ready and confident to try looking for a job to get back on my feet.\n\nProblem is, I have little to no employment history, and I'm 26 years old. I've only ever had 3 jobs: I worked at two different Wal-Mart's right out of high school, each only for a couple months. But I did work a factory job, with 10 to 12 hour shifts, lifting heavy steel wheels all day every day for 5 days a week for like 6 months back in 2014. That was the last job that I had. It was great, but due to mental health issues I ended up quitting and holed myself up in my mother's house as a hermit for several years due to fear of the outside.\n\nSo essentially what I'm getting at is, I really need to start seeking some sort of employment, and my counselor thinks I'm ready and has my back. I'm just completely at a loss (and nervous as all Hell) about how to answer this one particular interview question: \"Why haven't you been working the past 5 years?\" I have no idea how to answer the unemployment gap question.

I graduated with all A's in high school, and was voted \"most likely to succeed\" and \"class brain\" in a class of 400+. I got accepted to the premier public school in our state (a top 5 public school nationally), and while I admittedly became more lax with my studies in college and spent a good amount of time partying, I graduated with a degree in computer science with a 3.5+ GPA.\n\nThroughout that whole time, my sense of purpose was pretty straightforward: get good grades, so you can get a good job. Get good grades, so you can get a good job. Well, I got good grades, and I got a good job. I got hired as a software developer at a large firm in a relativity low-cost-of-living city with a six-figure salary straight out of college.\n\nThat's where the disillusionment started kicking in.\n\nThis job was not easy. It was really fucking hard, actually. After the training period ended, and I started taking on large projects and juggling a million other tasks, my hours started creeping up from 40 to 45 to 50 to 55 to 60. It was starting to feel like I was spending my entire workweek going from bed to work to the gym and back to bed again. And the stress never fucking stopped. It felt like I had to be constantly wrestling with these goddamn software problems in my head 24\/7 or I'd be falling behind. This job took up 100% of my mental energy. And I don't even fucking like software or coding. The more I had to do it, the more I began to detest every part of the job.\n\nBut surely the salary should make it at least somewhat worth it, right? Well, here's the problem with that. I don't really want anything. I'm naturally frugal. My favorite hobbies are dicking around on reddit, reading free books from the library, and getting drunk at dive bars on the weekend. I eat in for as many meals as possible (and cheaply, at that). Spending money does not come naturally to me, and a lot of the things I'm \"supposed to\" spend this money on, like a nice car, or a luxury apartment, or frequent plane trips around the world, seem incredibly wasteful to me and fundamentally not worth the money. What I want most in the world is just to learn things and cultivate relationships with people.\n\nSo I started looking into the only thing I could think to do with the money: saving it. I started reading personal finance and FIRE (financial independence &amp; retiring early) material all the time. I was literally saving 70% of my income. Fantasizing about retiring was basically my only motivation at this point.\n\nI started to think things over. It started to seem to me that my entire life I was basically on a conveyor belt towards joining the \"successful\" people. The entire school system is set up to push kids like me into these \"good jobs\". Well, here's the thing about good jobs. They pay a lot of money for a reason. Because the level of stress and responsibility you need to shoulder is proportional to the amount of money you're going to make. You make a lot of money as a reward for structuring your life around the needs of the company, and making your career the thing you're striving for at all possible moments. And what the fuck is money good for? So you can buy nicer toys than your neighbors and post Instagram pictures of yourself in fancy locations to make your friends jealous? So I can have some spoiled kids and a big house? I don't want those things.\n\nI remember sitting in my office at like 9pm one night, and the cleaning guy came through to empty out the trash in my office, and I thought, \"I would literally rather fucking clean this place's toilets than be a goddamn software developer.\"\n\nSo I quit. I put my two weeks in a few months ago without having another job lined up.\n\nI've been bartending and driving for Uber the last few months, making a little above minimum wage. And I can honestly say I prefer this to what I was doing 6 months ago. Now, could I keep this up for 50 years, and go through the real struggles of near-poverty and living paycheck-to-paycheck without a pile of cash as a failsafe? To be determined. But for the meantime, I'm finding it hard to muster the motivation to start applying to places and becoming \"successful\" again.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TrueOffMyChest","subreddit_id":"t5_2yuqy","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TrueOffMyChest","subreddit_subscribers":545264,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Being successful seems like a big fucking scam","total_awards_received":2,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/dbmb92\/being_successful_seems_like_a_big_fucking_scam\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I apologize for the length of this.\n\nI'm a teenager who's been questioning their gender for the past 6 months or so and I feel like I really want to be a guy, but I'm not sure if I have dysphoria. My main concern is that I was a hyper feminine child up until 12 when I turned hardcore tomboy, but I feel like since I've only started questioning my gender recently, that I might just be a tomboy who's confused. When i first started questioning i was very uncomfortable with my body, especially my hips and chest, but then it went away for a while. I got my hair cut back in August and since then I've been very worried that strangers will think I'm just a girl with short hair and I really want them to think I'm a guy. I'm 5' which distresses me because guys my age are supposed to be a lot taller and I just feel like if strangers are gonna think I'm a guy, I might as well look the part completely. My chest is pretty flat so I'm not too distressed over it, but my hips are wide and it makes me very uncomfortable. The thing with that is, I'm a little on the chubby side which I'm very insecure about, so I'm worried that maybe it's not hip dysphoria and its really just me being insecure about all the flab around my hips. I've heard trans people describe what dysphoria feels like and most of the time what I've heard is them describing it as almost a pain, and a pain that's crippling and makes you break down crying when you look in the mirror. I just look in the mirror and think \"Ew that's how I look?\", so I'm worried I'm just making this up and I'm just insecure. I understand that these things take time to figure out but I'm very impatient so I'm driving myself mad trying to figure this out. I understand that only I can make the call on whether or not I'm trans, but some advice would be greatly appreciated.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ftm","subreddit_id":"t5_2t9mw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ftm","subreddit_subscribers":72234,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Do I have dysphoria?","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ftm\/comments\/dbmcib\/do_i_have_dysphoria\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}
