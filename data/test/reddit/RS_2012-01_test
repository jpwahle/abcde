We met about 3 months ago. I'll spare you the unnecessary details, but there was instant chemistry between us and we began to hang out a lot. Within a week, we were talking almost every day, as well as going out to dinner, watching movies together, and hooking up. But she soon began to go hot and cold towards me. One week, things would be great. But somewhat suddenly, her attitude towards me would change, and it was like she had no interest in me at all. She went through this cycle 3 or 4 times, and eventually I got frustrated. We were out at a bar and she talked to this one guy the entire night. I got mad, left, and sent her an angry text. That didn't go over too well, and it eventually led to us talking about what was going on between us. She told me that we were \"just friends\" and that she was sorry if her drunken decisions gave me the wrong idea. She also told me that \"as far as dating, it's just not what I'm feeling.\"\n\nFine. I was disappointed but knew where we stood. She's part of my main social circle, so I knew I'd be seeing her a lot. I stopped pursuing her or giving her extra attention and just began to treat her as any of my other friends. And it had an interesting effect. The next few times we saw each other, she acted very flirty towards me. And another time soon after (about a week after our talk), she ended up spending the night after going out to the bars. We didn't hook up, but it was an interesting development. However, the next day she texting me apologizing and saying she shouldn't have done that.\n\nAll of this led up to a few nights ago. We had plans to go to a concert together which was 2 hours away. We made these plans a long time ago with friends, but it ended up being just me and her. And logistically, it made sense to spend the night at a hotel instead of driving back late. I figured this would be a good opportunity to gauge her interest.\n\nIt was an awesome night. We had a blast together, and headed back to our hotel after the show. We hung out for a while and had a few beers, and eventually we decided to lay in the bed. Which slowly turned into cuddling. Which turned into making out. It was like both of us were unsure if we should make a move, but once we did, we didn't hold back. We stayed up until 5 AM.\n\nThe next day, I wasn't sure how she'd react to things. I fully expected to get another text apologizing and regretting what happened. But it never came. In fact, things went the opposite direction. She told me how much fun she had. And the next night (last night, New Year's Eve), as midnight approached, she jokingly said \"so are we going to kiss at midnight?\" And sure enough, we did.\n\nSo, what do I do? She explicitly told me were \"friends\" and didn't want to date, but now things seem to be heading down that road. I'm afraid to do too much (or even too little) and mess things up.

This is my year in review.\n\nJanuary: After having an internal emotional battle with myself, fighting the fact that I'm bi, I accept it. Shortly then after I came out bi to my best friend at work (Geek Squad) his reaction was really positive and he said it didn't change anything (and it hasn't). Start writing many blogs at [Destructoid.](http://www.destructoid.com/blogs/dimmujed)\n\nFebruary: Come out to my fiance and daughter of my (now) 2 1/2 year old daughter. She cries. We had been having issues and she realizes this is the final nail in the proverbial coffin. We agree to split up as we had only been staying together for our daughter. I live with her till August. Get the iPhone 4 on Verizon for my birthday.\n\nMarch: Start to shave my arms, stomach and chest. Discovered Grindr / Skout. Tell my co-workers I'm bi, they don't believe me and think I'm joking (I joked around often). Let them know that I'd never done anything with a guy, just had these feelings. Also let them know that while I felt this way \"I could grow up wanting to be an astronaut and fantasize about being an astronaut, but then finally get to space to find out it fucking sucks.\"\n\nApril: Finally \"went to space\" after I was depressed and a cute dancer in a play that was in town from NYC messaged me on Grindr. We didn't go to \"space\" per say, but we did swap BJs. Made me realize I could date a guy and not just want to have sex with them.\n\nMay: A random guy adds me on Facebook out of no where. I start talking to him and he says he is closeted and has a GF. We start texting and talking on the phone for like 2 hours a night. After around 2 weeks I drive to meet him. We get a hotel room and \"go to space\" and it's 90% of everything I'd thought it would be. I take pictures of us kissing to \"prove\" to people at work that I'm serious. He tells me he \"L's\" me (as we refused to say the word love.) The next day he posts a bunch of stuff about how great his gf is and ignores me. \n\nHe also said he was going to come out to his family and we could date. I was naive. I got hurt / used bad. And I did something pretty bad...I had gotten a group text one that (and iPhone shows everyone the text goes to) and it only went to me and one other person, whom I assumed was his GF. So out of rage, I texted him that number and said \"This is your GF's number...right?\" To which he responded how the fuck did you get that. After he said some more hurtful things I sent the picture of us kissing to her. Turns out, she's a gold digger and stayed with him for a while until he broke up with her. We still text every now and then, I do feel awful about outing him.\n\nJune-July: A bit of depression and not much else other than visiting my first gay club, which was shocking at first but then pretty cool from then on.\n\nAugust: Get fired from Best Buy / Geek Squad after I do something equally stupid as this girl telling me that I'm gay and bi doesn't exist. Fuck it. It wasn't worth it but that place sucked anyways. We both ended up without a job. This happens the day before vacation is planned with my Mom. Mom and I go on the vacation to South Dakota and have a great time, it's exactly what I needed at the time.\n\nSeptember: After vacation I moved back in with my mom and ended up getting a call about a job I had applied for. It's in Columbus (aka the biggest city in Ohio...right?) I take the job and start on the 20th. I love it. I find roommates on Craigslist who are straight males, sane, clean and fine with me being bi. Even if they do seem a bit conservative in nature.\n\nOctober: Keep working at my job, enjoying it, go home to visit my daughter / family 3 weekends out of the month. Find that working 2nd shift it's really hard to meet friends, dates or otherwise. A random friend tells me to check out Reddit. Reddit tells me to check out OkCupid. \n\nI meet a cool Asian gaymer on OkCupid. We go on a date, he stays the night. We get along great, and date for around 2 weeks before I have to take a step back. I just need to know what I want and I'm not sure. He also was lacking in a certain department (this may make me shallow, but it's the truth) He has been drunk dialing me since then, I gave him a second chance but things were just awkward and he can't handle only being a friend.\n\nNovember: Ohio gets cold. I start to chat more on OkCupid with people and am obsessed with Reddit at this point. I also stop shaving my chest, because everyone says they like it unshaven. I hang out with a cute boy that lives 2 miles away. He is a bit young (18) but we have a lot in common. We talk to each other like we are dating, but when I finally bring it up we basically stop talking. It wouldn't have worked anyways, he is moving to New York in Feb. Also, Skyrim.\n\nDecember: I meet a 19 year old virgin girl on OkCupid. We have sex on the first date. She is cool, but I'm not sure she is what I want. I tell her we need to take a break. She tells me I'm an asshole when I tell her I think I like her. I meet a cool bisexual soccer player. I'm the first guy he has ever done anything with, he isn't out. I make him jizz in his pants. We go on two dates, the whole time I said I couldn't date him because of the distance (he lives 2 hours away for school, but is from here.) Then I realize I could date him...too late, he found another guy with more in common, but he had had a huge crush on me.\n\nI break down more and more each day as it nears Christmas. This was my first Xmas alone in 6 years. It just didn't feel the same. I did however get a fantastic Gaymer gift exchange gift that I will share later. It had a letter in it that made me cry as the person put a lot of time to cyber stalked me and got to know me personally through blogs etc. I had to work xmas day, with a girl who had been asking me if we were going to be working together in the office together, and had invited me out for her birthday. I totes had a crush on her. After work I asked her to the movies with me, she said to text her and see if she was busy. So the day after Christmas I went to the movies alone, watched Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, got drunk in the lobby (they serve liquor) and watched Tin Tin in 3D then walked to my favorite food in Columbus, Late Night Slice. It really wasn't that bad and the first time I'd done something out of the house since moving here, really.\n\nI have since stopped pursuing her. As I felt her excuse was lame.\n\n-------------\n\n**Notes / Summary:**\n\nIt is to be noted this has been a very depressing / growing year. I probably cried more in the months of November and December than ever. I cried at least once per day. After Christmas I found myself slowing getting back into the things I love. I have a ton of newer video games that I haven't played due to my depression. I also have my mojo back, I've been very randy over the past couple of days. \n\nAll in all I'd say fuck 2011. It was a depressing life changing year that I have to grow from. \n\n**Things I learned in 2011**:\n\n1. Hot girls want you to be their gay best friend. I'm bi, so fuck that.\n\n2. Everyone thinks because you like cock, you are some kind of fashionista / interior designer.  \n\n3. Most gay guys can't just be friends only\n\n4. Girls will put out on the first date, as will guys. It's ok, it saves everyone time and money.\n\n5. Don't put your dick in crazy.\n\n6. The q-tip test hurts like a father fucker\n\n7. Going places / watching movies alone isn't so bad.\n\n8. Lipstick lesbians exist\n\n9. Lesbian bars have \"gay guy nights\": Make sure to go on the appropriate night or feel like an ass\n\n10. There aren't manly gaymers who play FPS / TPS it seems\n\n11. Be. Yourself. \n\n12. Fake it till you make it. (I realize this sounds like it makes the above statement seem wrong, but when you \"fake it\" the only person you are faking out is yourself. You really are the golden God you are pretending to be, in other words, just you don't realize it.)\n\n13. Be Confident\n\n14. Be blunt / honest, it saves everyone grief and time.\n\n15. Not sure I could ever date a Christian\n\n16. I should only post pictures of myself on Reddit, as everything else gets down voted. (aka look pretty with my mouth closed)\n\n17. Reddit loves posts about Bestiality \n\n**2012's resolutions**: No Crying. Grasp what is there while it's there. Lose some of the weight. No procrastinating. Get back into gaming and blogging. Start making videos / vlogs / skits again. Get laid. Get a bf/gf/both.\n\n**TL;DR**: Came out bi, broke up with a fiance of 5 years and mother of my 2 1/2 year old daughter, had some shitty dates, learned some shit, was depressed. Went to space.","domain":"self.gaymers","num_comments":16,"likes":null,"clicked":false,"thumbnail":"self","saved":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s9n5","ups":17,"approved_by":null,"score":10,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 24 and came out bi this year, ending a 5 year relationship with my fiance and mother of my 2 1/2 year old daughter. This is my year in review.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;January: After having an internal emotional battle with myself, fighting the fact that I&amp;#39;m bi, I accept it. Shortly then after I came out bi to my best friend at work (Geek Squad) his reaction was really positive and he said it didn&amp;#39;t change anything (and it hasn&amp;#39;t). Start writing many blogs at &lt;a href=\"http://www.destructoid.com/blogs/dimmujed\"&gt;Destructoid.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;February: Come out to my fiance and daughter of my (now) 2 1/2 year old daughter. She cries. We had been having issues and she realizes this is the final nail in the proverbial coffin. We agree to split up as we had only been staying together for our daughter. I live with her till August. Get the iPhone 4 on Verizon for my birthday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;March: Start to shave my arms, stomach and chest. Discovered Grindr / Skout. Tell my co-workers I&amp;#39;m bi, they don&amp;#39;t believe me and think I&amp;#39;m joking (I joked around often). Let them know that I&amp;#39;d never done anything with a guy, just had these feelings. Also let them know that while I felt this way &amp;quot;I could grow up wanting to be an astronaut and fantasize about being an astronaut, but then finally get to space to find out it fucking sucks.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;April: Finally &amp;quot;went to space&amp;quot; after I was depressed and a cute dancer in a play that was in town from NYC messaged me on Grindr. We didn&amp;#39;t go to &amp;quot;space&amp;quot; per say, but we did swap BJs. Made me realize I could date a guy and not just want to have sex with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May: A random guy adds me on Facebook out of no where. I start talking to him and he says he is closeted and has a GF. We start texting and talking on the phone for like 2 hours a night. After around 2 weeks I drive to meet him. We get a hotel room and &amp;quot;go to space&amp;quot; and it&amp;#39;s 90% of everything I&amp;#39;d thought it would be. I take pictures of us kissing to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; to people at work that I&amp;#39;m serious. He tells me he &amp;quot;L&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; me (as we refused to say the word love.) The next day he posts a bunch of stuff about how great his gf is and ignores me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He also said he was going to come out to his family and we could date. I was naive. I got hurt / used bad. And I did something pretty bad...I had gotten a group text one that (and iPhone shows everyone the text goes to) and it only went to me and one other person, whom I assumed was his GF. So out of rage, I texted him that number and said &amp;quot;This is your GF&amp;#39;s number...right?&amp;quot; To which he responded how the fuck did you get that. After he said some more hurtful things I sent the picture of us kissing to her. Turns out, she&amp;#39;s a gold digger and stayed with him for a while until he broke up with her. We still text every now and then, I do feel awful about outing him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;June-July: A bit of depression and not much else other than visiting my first gay club, which was shocking at first but then pretty cool from then on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;August: Get fired from Best Buy / Geek Squad after I do something equally stupid as this girl telling me that I&amp;#39;m gay and bi doesn&amp;#39;t exist. Fuck it. It wasn&amp;#39;t worth it but that place sucked anyways. We both ended up without a job. This happens the day before vacation is planned with my Mom. Mom and I go on the vacation to South Dakota and have a great time, it&amp;#39;s exactly what I needed at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;September: After vacation I moved back in with my mom and ended up getting a call about a job I had applied for. It&amp;#39;s in Columbus (aka the biggest city in Ohio...right?) I take the job and start on the 20th. I love it. I find roommates on Craigslist who are straight males, sane, clean and fine with me being bi. Even if they do seem a bit conservative in nature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;October: Keep working at my job, enjoying it, go home to visit my daughter / family 3 weekends out of the month. Find that working 2nd shift it&amp;#39;s really hard to meet friends, dates or otherwise. A random friend tells me to check out Reddit. Reddit tells me to check out OkCupid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I meet a cool Asian gaymer on OkCupid. We go on a date, he stays the night. We get along great, and date for around 2 weeks before I have to take a step back. I just need to know what I want and I&amp;#39;m not sure. He also was lacking in a certain department (this may make me shallow, but it&amp;#39;s the truth) He has been drunk dialing me since then, I gave him a second chance but things were just awkward and he can&amp;#39;t handle only being a friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;November: Ohio gets cold. I start to chat more on OkCupid with people and am obsessed with Reddit at this point. I also stop shaving my chest, because everyone says they like it unshaven. I hang out with a cute boy that lives 2 miles away. He is a bit young (18) but we have a lot in common. We talk to each other like we are dating, but when I finally bring it up we basically stop talking. It wouldn&amp;#39;t have worked anyways, he is moving to New York in Feb. Also, Skyrim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;December: I meet a 19 year old virgin girl on OkCupid. We have sex on the first date. She is cool, but I&amp;#39;m not sure she is what I want. I tell her we need to take a break. She tells me I&amp;#39;m an asshole when I tell her I think I like her. I meet a cool bisexual soccer player. I&amp;#39;m the first guy he has ever done anything with, he isn&amp;#39;t out. I make him jizz in his pants. We go on two dates, the whole time I said I couldn&amp;#39;t date him because of the distance (he lives 2 hours away for school, but is from here.) Then I realize I could date him...too late, he found another guy with more in common, but he had had a huge crush on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I break down more and more each day as it nears Christmas.

We've been dating for 5 months now.  While having sex I just got the feeling that she wasn't having as much fun as I was.  I don't have a big dick and won't be asked to star in a porno anytime soon, but I've well within \"average\" (nearly 6 1/2\"), small for some but statistically average.  Now, I've always harbored some insecurity about the package but I think some insesurity is normal, especially in a new relationship when you're feeling things out so to speak.  Anyway, so i told her that if there is anything that she would like me to do she can ask or if there is something different I can do to make sex more pleasurable that I'm down for it, that she doesn't need to be shy.  She responded with something along the lines of \"its me, I've just never been good at sex\".  I felt relieved.  Thought it was all me and maybe I didnt measure up and stimulate her enough.  Ok, so I'm thinking its just a matter of time and growing more comfortable with each other.  But later when talking about our past and everything our sexual history came up.  I was afraid to share but I was honest and told her the number of partners I've had (around 25), she admitted to having 20.  Now... is it unreasonable for me to be confused by her having 20 partners and still be shy and \"bad\" at sex?  i find it unrealistic.  She was in a sorority in college, and shyness is not the first thing I think of when I think of fraternity and sorority members.  Those are usually very confident and outgoing people.  She admitted to being a party girl after college, too.  Lots of friends, \"never without a date\" as she put it, danced on bar tops on more than a few occasions, liked her beer and here is the kicker -when asked she admitted to having slept with a couple of people just to sleep with them.  Now, she was young and attractive and social and liked to have a good time.  Seems to me a woman with confidence in her self and her sexuality.  Definitely not shy.  So it doesn't add up for me.  I find it inconsistent.  I asked her point blank if our sex life satisfying and if I measured up.  She said yes.  But said stupid shit like \"you're huge\".  lol.  Look, I know i don't have a huge anything and don't really have a complex about it either, I've had my share of partners and I know where I stack up on the measurements and all that.  But it felt condescending to hear \"compliments\" like that.  It felt disingenuous.  Like it was said because she thought my ego needed it.  Anyway... I think she is lying.  Both about her being \"bad\" at sex and how sexually satisfying she finds me.  AM I being paranoid or what?  I don't really care about her past.  I mean, I want to know anything and everything she wants to share with me, I really like her and want to know everything about her and understand her, but i wont hold the past against her.  I'm digging her and looking to the future.  And thats the problem.  I doubt her sincerity and honesty.  Which makes me doubt her respect for me and \"us\".  Would a woman ever even tell the truth if it was about size and shit like that?  I understand everyone is different but any female thoughts would be appreciated.  See, if she was honest and said that \"yeah, its a sexual compatibility issue\" I would get it.  It would hurt to lose someone over the size of something I have no control over and having a relationship decided on just one attribute of so many,  but in the long run I would appreciate her honesty and respect her not leading me on.

We're pretty damn open and honest with each other, but I have no idea how to respond to this little thing.\n * We're both at our respective homes for break (we go to the same school) so we're apart  but have kept in close contact (IM, text, video chat) almost daily\n * **Last night she hooked up with her ex which she was so excited about because she's been frustrated that since their breakup he's been too awkward to be friends with, even.**\n * I'm only mildly jealous (just because i did not hook up with anyone, though i had an otherwise enjoyable night)\n * **But then, in her excited raving about the successful evening, she said *\"talking to him is just so great-- it's like talking to you but so much better.\"***\n * Really? Why would you say something like that? \n * I kind of stopped responding while i tried to make sense of what she said and what i was feeling. \n * She then changed the subject to how badly she wanted to be with me (she does have an incredible drive), and it was like i was cornered into dirty talking for her and that felt gross.

Sure i might get jealous, but i have similar feelings towards others all the time. I'm well aware that we're all deeply flawed, and nobody can be perfect for anybody. \n * **I know that what i don't want is any i-didn't-really-mean-its, and more importantly/probably, for her to be afraid of criticizing me or saying anything that might upset me.

I went on the pill in the tenth grade mostly because I wanted to have sex with my boyfriend at the time. Seven years and five different pills later, I had to go off it. It wasn't for me.

I don't like taking excess medication (I'm always the last person to take even an Advil when they have a headache) because I don't like being tired.

And as most know southern Cali has quite some hot spots for paranormal activity. And since I'm bored while down here currently I'm just going to share a quick little thing that happened on December 10th 2010.\n\nOn December 10th 2010 at 5:15 my best friend was put down. And at the time he was sick. He would hack and cough horribly. Later on after a few months of this my mom called my grandmother (who I'm currently with while writing this) told her to tell her psychic friend (psychic towards animals) to see how he was feeling. One of the things she said I'd I remember was his name \"Oley\". She said he was just sick and wanted to go. So that week we unexpectedly arranged him to be out down in our porch. After he left and was token away to be cremated we just sat there not knowing what to do. My mom at the time was making a small album for him on the computer. She told me to grab a picture I had if him hanging in the wall next to my bed (my bed was a bunk bed against the wall and I had the picture hanging by a thumbtack) she told me to go grab it so I did. Right when I got to my bed to release the thumbtack I froze. I didn't know what was happening I heard him. I heard his breathing as if he was at the foot of my bed sleeping, let me take note also on how most of the times when he would go to bed would be on my bed. So continuing I stood there for maybe 3 seconds of silence hearing him. I then ran out in terror not knowing what I just had heard. I told my mom about it and so we went back into my room together, I was still hearing it. But she couldn't. I can test this theory of my hearing it only because me and him were the closest together in the family. I just then shook it off and continued with my day.\n\nLater that night I was sitting on the couch watching TV with my dad while he's sitting on the other couch. He said to me \"do you her that Ben?\" I then just look at him like \"what the fuck is he talking about\". Then I notice it. The hallway. All my attention is drawn to that. It's the only section of the house with its light on. We both drew silent. Along with him we both heard the sound of Oleys claws walking out of my room into the wood floor hallway then coming onto the living room carpet and then jumping onto of the arm of the couch from my spot. And as this happened I felt a cold breeze hit my cheek. I then just sat there as this presence infested my part if the couch. Ever since then I haven't experienced anything major besides constantly hearing him mostly every time I go into my room, and it's welcoming. Not hostile at all. So! That's all  I have for now.\n\nAlso I *Will* post pictures. But since I'm 7 hours away from home I can't post pictures currently, and mostly because I'm writing this from my grandmothers IPad. But as soon as I get home I will post photos.\n\nTL;DR: Dog was put down, very close to each other.

Sorry for the wall of text that you're about to experience. I'm hysterical right now and I just need someone to listen.\n\nSome background info because my family is insanely complicated: I'm 18, female, home for winter break from college, and my family is split right down the middle and my dad's half of the family no longer talks to us. I don't keep communication with them because my dad doesn't want me and abandoned our family when I was 5. There were visitations but I made a personal choice about 3 years ago to no longer see him or his half anymore. I live with my mom and younger brother, and my grandparents live close by. Everyone else in our family lives either in Europe or on the other side of the US. I don't have many people to talk to.\n\nLast night for New Year's I went to a party with all my old friends from home. These parties happened all the time back in high school, thrown by the same people in our circle of friends, and it was always really fun. Last night was our circle of friends' first get together since leaving for college. Everything was great until after midnight when the parents and their friends went out back to the firepit and hottub to have their own party, and the drinking in the house started. Everyone's mixing juice, vodka, rum, whatever they can find and just having a good time getting drunk.\n\nNow, I've never actually gotten drunk before. It's not because I don't like the idea of getting drunk, heck, I get high all the time in college and smoking is a lot of fun. But with any kind of alcohol, I just simply don't like the taste of it. It's absolutely vile and I can't even hold it in my mouth without gagging. I guess that's where shots come in and you're not supposed to taste it, but I just can't do it. I don't know how to make it go to the back of my throat and be cool like that. I really wanted to get drunk last night, I figured that since I'm with friends, it'd be a safe environment, so I was encouraging them to help me learn about alcohol and how to do it. So after some time, according to my friends who are all drunk by then, I'm a wimp and can't handle alcohol. My best friend, who just starting drinking in college after a lifetime of saying how much he hates alcohol, and who is a generally really arrogant person to begin with, was saying most of these things to me...how my friends shouldn't even try to pour me things because I can't take a shot, how my drinks were wimpy, and overall, everyone was just pressuring me and making me feel like shit. My friends have never been like this before. I drank two cups of juice mixed with the tiniest bit of vodka and I felt sick to my stomach. After they had sort of stopped trying, I went to the back door of the house (the only place that there was cell service) and texted my mom at about 1 to ask if she could bring me home (she had driven me to the party because she doesn't like when I drive in the dark). She said sure, and showed up in ten minutes. Nobody at the party noticed that I had broken down crying in the back because I felt so violated and 'uncool', and when my mom got there, I just grabbed my stuff and left.\n\nWe get home, and I'm laying in my mom's bed with her, just talking and crying and needing support. At first, she was completely supportive, showing intense anger at my best friend for what a dick he could really be, and letting me know that it's not my fault and that I don't have to drink if I don't want to. All the usual supportive stuff. It was making me feel better, and I was just trying to get sleep while she talked to me, until her gentle support escalated to insane anger at my best friend, which escalated to saying things like \"if you forgive him, I'm never coming to get you ever again.\" At that point I was just irritated, saying of course I'm going to let him know how uncomfortable I felt, and that I really don't think I fit in with them anymore. I have no idea how but she eventually turned to yelling at me, screaming things like \"I was going 70 down those dirt roads thinking something was wrong with you. You should have called me instead of texted me so I knew there wasn't an emergency. I could have gotten killed.\" Mind you, she was *screaming* at me. At that point I had grabbed my pillows from behind me and stormed back to my room, hysterically crying because she was yelling at me when I already felt like the shittiest person alive. All I did was text her saying \"Can you come pick me up?\" I didn't think I did anything wrong. She always told me she'd come get me in a heartbeat if I ever felt uncomfortable somewhere.\n\nWell, she came to talk to me a few minutes later and I was hysterical and didn't wanna talk for the life of me. I felt so betrayed and worthless, like coming to get me was such a hassle and it wasn't worth it. I very well could have driven myself home if I was allowed to drive myself there. So she left when all I could do was babble in between sobs and tell her I didn't wanna talk to her, and she stormed out and slammed my door, muttering things like \"I swear, I just wanna take a plane or something and get the hell out of here and leave everything behind.\" She says things like that all the time when she's upset, I know she won't actually do it because my mom is mostly all talk and no doing...but knowing that everyone else in my family has actually abandoned me, it makes me feel worse and worse when she says those words..\n\nThis morning my mom left the house to go have brunch with friends or whatever, and she won't talk to me.\n\nI've been crying and feeling like shit all night and all morning, and I feel like I don't belong anywhere. Like I'm not cool enough to be with people my age who drink 24/7 and I'm not worth anything and I'm stupid and everything is my fault. I wanna run away and I'm too scared to because I love college and being far away from all this, I'm a straight A student in all sorts of clubs, I have a boyfriend that absolutely loves me and makes me feel beautiful...I try so hard to make something of myself...why am I doing everything all wrong? I'm not suicidal, god I'm scared of that. I would never end my life or cut myself or anything, even though I'm wondering what it would be like if I wasn't alive anymore. Like how many people would actually care if I disappeared? \n\nSo...I don't really know what I'm asking for here. Maybe just someone to talk to. I just need to know what I'm doing wrong in life. I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit or if I'm supposed to be asking something in particular...please understand that it felt so good to type all this out first of all, and to get it off my chest. I can't talk to my friends and I don't have any family nearby and my boyfriend lives in another state and is at work right now. I don't know what I did wrong. This is mostly about my relationship with my mom, and what I could have done to make her so upset with me.\n\nI am really, really sorry this is so long. If you don't take the time to read it, that's perfectly okay.\n\n**tl;dr** - I don't like alcohol, and my friends were pressuring me and making me feel awful last night, and my mom made it about a thousand times worse. I feel like I don't belong anywhere.

I don&amp;#39;t keep communication with them because my dad doesn&amp;#39;t want me and abandoned our family when I was 5. There were visitations but I made a personal choice about 3 years ago to no longer see him or his half anymore. I live with my mom and younger brother, and my grandparents live close by. Everyone else in our family lives either in Europe or on the other side of the US. I don&amp;#39;t have many people to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night for New Year&amp;#39;s I went to a party with all my old friends from home. These parties happened all the time back in high school, thrown by the same people in our circle of friends, and it was always really fun. Last night was our circle of friends&amp;#39; first get together since leaving for college. Everything was great until after midnight when the parents and their friends went out back to the firepit and hottub to have their own party, and the drinking in the house started. Everyone&amp;#39;s mixing juice, vodka, rum, whatever they can find and just having a good time getting drunk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;ve never actually gotten drunk before. It&amp;#39;s not because I don&amp;#39;t like the idea of getting drunk, heck, I get high all the time in college and smoking is a lot of fun. But with any kind of alcohol, I just simply don&amp;#39;t like the taste of it. It&amp;#39;s absolutely vile and I can&amp;#39;t even hold it in my mouth without gagging. I guess that&amp;#39;s where shots come in and you&amp;#39;re not supposed to taste it, but I just can&amp;#39;t do it. I don&amp;#39;t know how to make it go to the back of my throat and be cool like that.
