I live in north county, but find myself always on the move throughout San Diego. When the weather cools down, I&amp;#39;d like to get out more and be active with hiking and other activities. Former ent, but I decided to quit for work and personal reasons, but I don&amp;#39;t have a problem with anyone that does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like meeting and talking to people because I feel like everyone has something they can teach you, whether it be about a particular topic relevant to your interests or even about their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anything in here sounds appealing, or if there&amp;#39;s anything you want to ask, please feel free!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","ups":2,"secure_media_embed":{},"domain":"self.SoCalR4R","secure_media":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"edited":false,"link_flair_text":null,"title":"26 [M4R] in San Diego.

I don't even know why I did it. I didn't do it just once. I did it many times. I shouldn't of done it. When will he take me away? \n\nIt all started when I was a young child, maybe four or five. It started in my sleep actually. I had this voice that talked to me when I was dreaming. This is not uncommon, but I had never heard this voice before. This voice was so deep, that the first time I heard it, even my young naive mind knew it was not human. It didn't trouble me at first. It was friendly, and talked to me gently and to be honest, that voice pretty much gained my confidence. Kind of like an imaginary dream friend. But in my head. After a few months, I started hearing it when I was awake. Even then it was being gentle and friendly, and I had no problems with it. Until the day my grandfather died a few years later. I was not really close to the guy, barely knew him. He was wheelchair bound and a crazed alcoholic, so my parents, who are pretty protective, didn't let him see me that much. The moment we pulled up in the driveway of the funeral home, I knew something was wrong. Those memories are so vivid in my mind. How could I forget? It started talking to me but not in the nice usual way. The voice was screaming random mean perverted things to me. Things kid's shouldn't hear. I told him to stop. My parents stared at me for a moment, and I realized I had just said that out loud. After telling my mom everything was fine , we got inside. We spent well over half an hour in the funeral home as my parents shared condolences with the rest of the family and friends. I was standing beside the corpse, and noticed a shining crucifix. Not being from a religious family and all, I didn't really cared about Jesus, but I thought it was pretty nice, so I walked up to it and touched it. The moment I touched it, everything went wrong. The voice in my head started yelling so loud, that I dropped on the ground hands over my ears, screaming. Everyone stopped what they were doing and just stared at me. Thinking about it now, I kind of feel embarrassed but what ever they probably forgot. My mom, tears in her eyes grabbed me by my shoulders and started shaking me telling me to stop. That's when it happened. I can remember it with so much detail every time I think about it It's like I had headphones on my head playing it back. The voice in my head screamed at me ``YOUR SOUL WILL BE MINE.`` And suddenly it stopped. My mom took me back home while my dad stayed at the funeral until the end. \n\n\nThis might seem incredible, but It's just the beginning. I was too scared to sleep for a few days after this, but eventually, I had no choice. Surprisingly, my sleep was not troubled by a screaming voice, and I was pretty damn happy about it. It had stopped. For a short time. A few days later, it talked to me. I was sure in my mind , that if it came back, it would be as violent as it was at the funeral, but to my surprise, it was apologetic. Apologies were offered, and me being a naive young boy, accepted them. To make up for it's misdeeds, the voice offered to take me flying, as it said. I was , like every boy pretty fond of flying, so I accepted. It took me , as some people call it , on a lucid dream, or on a out of body experience. If you are not familiar with this, it is as if your mind got out of your body and traveled anywhere it wanted. Some people don't believe in this, but I do. I remember it so clearly, as I rushed through the hot summer air flying above my neighborhood. I felt so free. Unfortunately, my trip quickly ended and I was pulled back into my body so fast , kind of like a slingshot. Once back inside my body, saw it. A large shadow, with no traits. If it had a face, I could not see it. It just stood there, possibly staring at me. I was terrified, I tried to run , but I could not move nor speak. I was so scared I puked. All over my bed sheets. When I looked up, the shadow was gone, and I started crying and yelling for my parents. They rushed in the room asking what was wrong. When I told them about the shadow, they said what every one would of said. ¨It was your imagination¨or ¨It was probably a dream.¨ No it was not. I remember seeing that shadow, and I was well awake.\n\n\nFor the next few years, it was thought I had OCD. Every time I went around a pole for example, I had to come around it on the other side. If I dribbled a ball once with one hand, I had to do it with the other. Those are just a few example, but the point is, I didn't have OCD. Every time I did something like this, the voice in my head told me to do it, or my soul would be his. This takes us to the beginning of this post. I agreed to those requests every time.

I don&amp;#39;t even know why I did it. I didn&amp;#39;t do it just once. I did it many times. I shouldn&amp;#39;t of done it. When will he take me away? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all started when I was a young child, maybe four or five. It started in my sleep actually. I had this voice that talked to me when I was dreaming. This is not uncommon, but I had never heard this voice before. This voice was so deep, that the first time I heard it, even my young naive mind knew it was not human. It didn&amp;#39;t trouble me at first. It was friendly, and talked to me gently and to be honest, that voice pretty much gained my confidence. Kind of like an imaginary dream friend. But in my head. After a few months, I started hearing it when I was awake. Even then it was being gentle and friendly, and I had no problems with it. Until the day my grandfather died a few years later. I was not really close to the guy, barely knew him. He was wheelchair bound and a crazed alcoholic, so my parents, who are pretty protective, didn&amp;#39;t let him see me that much. The moment we pulled up in the driveway of the funeral home, I knew something was wrong. Those memories are so vivid in my mind. How could I forget? It started talking to me but not in the nice usual way. The voice was screaming random mean perverted things to me. Things kid&amp;#39;s shouldn&amp;#39;t hear. I told him to stop. My parents stared at me for a moment, and I realized I had just said that out loud. After telling my mom everything was fine , we got inside. We spent well over half an hour in the funeral home as my parents shared condolences with the rest of the family and friends. I was standing beside the corpse, and noticed a shining crucifix. Not being from a religious family and all, I didn&amp;#39;t really cared about Jesus, but I thought it was pretty nice, so I walked up to it and touched it. The moment I touched it, everything went wrong. The voice in my head started yelling so loud, that I dropped on the ground hands over my ears, screaming. Everyone stopped what they were doing and just stared at me. Thinking about it now, I kind of feel embarrassed but what ever they probably forgot. My mom, tears in her eyes grabbed me by my shoulders and started shaking me telling me to stop. That&amp;#39;s when it happened. I can remember it with so much detail every time I think about it It&amp;#39;s like I had headphones on my head playing it back. The voice in my head screamed at me &lt;code&gt;YOUR SOUL WILL BE MINE.&lt;/code&gt; And suddenly it stopped. My mom took me back home while my dad stayed at the funeral until the end. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This might seem incredible, but It&amp;#39;s just the beginning. I was too scared to sleep for a few days after this, but eventually, I had no choice. Surprisingly, my sleep was not troubled by a screaming voice, and I was pretty damn happy about it. It had stopped. For a short time. A few days later, it talked to me. I was sure in my mind , that if it came back, it would be as violent as it was at the funeral, but to my surprise, it was apologetic. Apologies were offered, and me being a naive young boy, accepted them. To make up for it&amp;#39;s misdeeds, the voice offered to take me flying, as it said. I was , like every boy pretty fond of flying, so I accepted. It took me , as some people call it , on a lucid dream, or on a out of body experience. If you are not familiar with this, it is as if your mind got out of your body and traveled anywhere it wanted. Some people don&amp;#39;t believe in this, but I do. I remember it so clearly, as I rushed through the hot summer air flying above my neighborhood. I felt so free. Unfortunately, my trip quickly ended and I was pulled back into my body so fast , kind of like a slingshot. Once back inside my body, saw it. A large shadow, with no traits. If it had a face, I could not see it. It just stood there, possibly staring at me. I was terrified, I tried to run , but I could not move nor speak. I was so scared I puked. All over my bed sheets. When I looked up, the shadow was gone, and I started crying and yelling for my parents. They rushed in the room asking what was wrong. When I told them about the shadow, they said what every one would of said. ¨It was your imagination¨or ¨It was probably a dream.¨ No it was not. I remember seeing that shadow, and I was well awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the next few years, it was thought I had OCD. Every time I went around a pole for example, I had to come around it on the other side. If I dribbled a ball once with one hand, I had to do it with the other. Those are just a few example, but the point is, I didn&amp;#39;t have OCD. Every time I did something like this, the voice in my head told me to do it, or my soul would be his. This takes us to the beginning of this post. I agreed to those requests every time. It was challenging me and I agreed every time. The climax of those small events happened at my town&amp;#39;s pool.

Unfortunately, I&amp;#39;m from kind of a small town, and so the only person I could see about it was a social worker, and totally creeped me out, so I only ended up going a couple times and refused medication because I didn&amp;#39;t want to turn into a zombie. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When my parents split up, my mom couldn&amp;#39;t afford health insurance and her job didn&amp;#39;t offer any, so she put me on Medicaid. Flash forward a couple years, and knowing I was going to be booted off of medicaid at 21, I decided to get an Implanon (implanted hormonal birth control device) because I didn&amp;#39;t know if/when I&amp;#39;d be able to afford the pill. The Implanon was probably the worst decision I&amp;#39;ve ever made for myself. It made me extremely depressed and anxious, completely wiped out any libido I had, and made me gain weight (about 40 lbs) and made that weight impossible to lose (which is hell for someone who had suffered an eating disorder in her past). For the year and a half that I had it in, I was never happy, most of the time being extremely sad, and I constantly worried about every little thing, and even had violent outbursts and mood swings. It was awful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, I finally sought help. After fighting with my husband nonstop for about a month, I finally made the decision to have it removed. It came out today. After a long talk with my doctor, she prescribed me 50 mg daily of Zoloft, along with a new method of contraception. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m absolutely freaking out. I&amp;#39;m worrying to the point of tears and shaking. I&amp;#39;m so absolutely terrified that the Zoloft will either A) turn me into a zombie that feels nothing or B) elevate my depression and anxiety even more, just like the Implanon, and fix nothing.

Unfortunately, I'm from kind of a small town, and so the only person I could see about it was a social worker, and totally creeped me out, so I only ended up going a couple times and refused medication because I didn't want to turn into a zombie. \n\nWhen my parents split up, my mom couldn't afford health insurance and her job didn't offer any, so she put me on Medicaid. Flash forward a couple years, and knowing I was going to be booted off of medicaid at 21, I decided to get an Implanon (implanted hormonal birth control device) because I didn't know if/when I'd be able to afford the pill. The Implanon was probably the worst decision I've ever made for myself. It made me extremely depressed and anxious, completely wiped out any libido I had, and made me gain weight (about 40 lbs) and made that weight impossible to lose (which is hell for someone who had suffered an eating disorder in her past). For the year and a half that I had it in, I was never happy, most of the time being extremely sad, and I constantly worried about every little thing, and even had violent outbursts and mood swings. It was awful.\n\nToday, I finally sought help. After fighting with my husband nonstop for about a month, I finally made the decision to have it removed. It came out today. After a long talk with my doctor, she prescribed me 50 mg daily of Zoloft, along with a new method of contraception. \n\nI'm absolutely freaking out. I'm worrying to the point of tears and shaking. I'm so absolutely terrified that the Zoloft will either A) turn me into a zombie that feels nothing or B) elevate my depression and anxiety even more, just like the Implanon, and fix nothing. I'm also freaking out about it making me gain even more weight and/or keep me from losing. And I know it's silly, and that my health take precedence, but I'm really annoyed at the fact that I can't drink, I mean, I'm 22 and I want to be able to have a drink with my friends. I'm scared this will cause more problems than it fixes, and I feel like I just keep making terrible decisions for myself.... that nagging feeling that I can't do anything right....\n\nI know that was really long but I guess I'm hoping someone here has had a similar experience or can offer something helpful.","link_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"Anxiety","media":null,"created_utc":1349127028,"banned_by":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qmij","report_reasons":null}

We've been inseparable. We dated for about 2 weeks casually, hit it off really well, and I've rarely spent a night without him since.\n\nI got divorced about 12 months ago. My ex was pretty crazy, and right when the crazy came out I left him. We fought for about 6 months after, as I tried to get him to divorce me. Right when the divorce finalized, I started seeing someone. His name was Mark. Things were different with Mark, and I frankly still can't stop thinking about him. It was supposed to be a casual thing; I just got divorced from my first boyfriend ever, and I'm 23. I was in no place to get serious. We were together knowing it had an expiration date; he was moving out the country and had no interest in a LTR. I understood, and we had a great time. After a few months of dating I realized I was falling for him, and we broke things off. That was about 9 months ago, so pretty soon after that I started seeing my current bf, James. (Yes these are totally made up names :P)\n\nMark still hasn't left town; he was supposed to by March. I havent seen him in months, but we chat online now and then. We're friendly and still get along/ always seem to have something to talk about. Or maybe we're both just missing each other and want to talk and end up chatting about the weather. I see this guy as my soul mate in a lot of ways; our time together was unreal, and I feel like I've been stuck in a cloudy dream since I stopped seeing him. He's leaving though, and I am not apart of that plan, plain and simple. I'm not going to hold my breath that he'll come back in 1-2 years and we'll still feel the same. I feel like we will, but it would be foolish to plan for it.\n\nSo now I've been with James for the last 7 months. Things are wonderful with him. He brings me peace and happy-good feelings that I've never found with someone. He's my dream guy in a lot of ways. He's got a lot, a lot of wonderful qualities that I love, and I can't think of really anything I don't like about him. It's just, I don't feel that connection. It feels like it did with my ex-husband a little; we're a good match, but there's better matches out there. I love him and feel we're really beginning to call in love. But Mark still races in my mind. I've found myself reluctant to let go of Mark and really open to James.\n\nAlso, my relationship with James is like everything that should have happened in my marriage. I see him and our relationship like my failed marriage. I don't know how to get past that. James is nothing like my ex (in the bad ways anyway), but the relationships, the way we started dating, the go getter kind of guys they were, are very similar. I know James would be a wonderful guy to be married to someday; I'm not scared the commitment. I'm scared because I don't feel that special feeling, just like i didnt feel with my ex. I felt something so damn strong with Mark I'm still left speechless over it. What do I do? How do I progress and open myself to the possibilities with James? Do I say something to Mark before he leaves? Do I tell James how I really feel, or will I grow past this? Why has the thought of Mark only grown stronger in my head?\n\n**tl;dr:** I'm in a wonderful relationship but can't for get an ex. I want to embrace the new guy but don't have the heart.\n","link_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1413530616,"num_comments":4,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/10s3tm/i_am_24f_with_a_23m_boyfriend_of_7_months_i_think/","gilded":0,"author":"alreadytakenhm","distinguished":null,"downs":0,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little long, but please read.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 months, moved in together at 4 months.

We were together knowing it had an expiration date; he was moving out the country and had no interest in a LTR. I understood, and we had a great time. After a few months of dating I realized I was falling for him, and we broke things off. That was about 9 months ago, so pretty soon after that I started seeing my current bf, James. (Yes these are totally made up names :P)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mark still hasn&amp;#39;t left town; he was supposed to by March. I havent seen him in months, but we chat online now and then. We&amp;#39;re friendly and still get along/ always seem to have something to talk about. Or maybe we&amp;#39;re both just missing each other and want to talk and end up chatting about the weather. I see this guy as my soul mate in a lot of ways; our time together was unreal, and I feel like I&amp;#39;ve been stuck in a cloudy dream since I stopped seeing him. He&amp;#39;s leaving though, and I am not apart of that plan, plain and simple. I&amp;#39;m not going to hold my breath that he&amp;#39;ll come back in 1-2 years and we&amp;#39;ll still feel the same. I feel like we will, but it would be foolish to plan for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#39;ve been with James for the last 7 months. Things are wonderful with him. He brings me peace and happy-good feelings that I&amp;#39;ve never found with someone. He&amp;#39;s my dream guy in a lot of ways. He&amp;#39;s got a lot, a lot of wonderful qualities that I love, and I can&amp;#39;t think of really anything I don&amp;#39;t like about him. It&amp;#39;s just, I don&amp;#39;t feel that connection. It feels like it did with my ex-husband a little; we&amp;#39;re a good match, but there&amp;#39;s better matches out there. I love him and feel we&amp;#39;re really beginning to call in love. But Mark still races in my mind. I&amp;#39;ve found myself reluctant to let go of Mark and really open to James.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, my relationship with James is like everything that should have happened in my marriage. I see him and our relationship like my failed marriage. I don&amp;#39;t know how to get past that. James is nothing like my ex (in the bad ways anyway), but the relationships, the way we started dating, the go getter kind of guys they were, are very similar. I know James would be a wonderful guy to be married to someday; I&amp;#39;m not scared the commitment. I&amp;#39;m scared because I don&amp;#39;t feel that special feeling, just like i didnt feel with my ex. I felt something so damn strong with Mark I&amp;#39;m still left speechless over it. What do I do? How do I progress and open myself to the possibilities with James? Do I say something to Mark before he leaves? Do I tell James how I really feel, or will I grow past this? Why has the thought of Mark only grown stronger in my head?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m in a wonderful relationship but can&amp;#39;t for get an ex. I want to embrace the new guy but don&amp;#39;t have the heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","thumbnail":"self","stickied":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"secure_media":null,"domain":"self.relationships"}

Suddenly she was saying things like, &amp;quot;God is the foundation for everything&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Do you not believe in the power of prayer?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;How do you think we got here?&amp;quot;  I knew everything I said would get washed away in the waves of her mind.  She wanted me to say things that she could debate and prove me wrong so that I would &amp;quot;see the light&amp;quot; and realize that I needed church and God in my life. I was as calm and rational as possible and when the only answers I had for some of her questions would cause inflammatory discussion, I quietly sat and didn&amp;#39;t answer.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She made me feel guilty and even worse than how I felt before talking to her.  When I awoke this morning, I heard her talking to my dad on the phone.  She said that they needed to make an appointment for me to talk to a priest, buy books for me to read, and help me find the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; path again.  I was offended and hurt.

How do I get them to see that I&amp;#39;m an adult and I&amp;#39;ve come to my beliefs through research and reflection.  What do I do if they give me an ultimatum?  Do I go talk to a priest to humor them or do I stand my ground and politely tell them no?

He told me that he heard I was having trouble with my depression and we had a really good conversation about it.

He said that he&amp;#39;s Catholic because that was what he grew up as and joked that he thought the rest of the world was Catholic until he moved away from home.  He admitted that he doesn&amp;#39;t believe in all of the church&amp;#39;s teachings and even stopped going to confession because he felt like a hypocrite.  He finally feels content with not accepting all parts of the Catholic doctrine.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He seemed somewhat relieved when I pointed out that for the most part I haven&amp;#39;t changed that much since the spring.

I&amp;#39;m not looking to OMFG LOSE TONS OF WEIGHT or anything (I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;6 and like...135 lbs, I think, but a good chunk of that is muscle from cycling/former lifting). Just looking to shed that last wee bit of ab flab/hip fat/inner thigh squish, and it&amp;#39;s gotten past the point of simple &amp;quot;eat less calories,&amp;quot; mostly because I have 0 self control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried Leangains and while I liked the IF (I still keep to a rough 16/8 schedule), the macro counting was not so much for me (AHHH I&amp;#39;M TOO HIGH ON THIS AND TOO LOW ON THIS AND OMFG /insane). And any diet that prohibits cheese is not one that I could possibly stick to (hell, for Christmas my mom got me a year-long subscription to Cheese of the Month club). And I lovelovelove reading about nutrition and fitness and different diets (when I say &amp;quot;diet&amp;quot; I mean more &amp;quot;eating styles&amp;quot; than I do &amp;quot;weight loss plans). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So finally one day, Friday to be exact, I decided on something new. I decided on Friday that I was going to eat everything ever. Craptons of carbs. And then I was going to fast for the better part of Saturday. And Saturday night, I would start my first day of keto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(For the sake of sanity and other things, I&amp;#39;m aiming for CKD, with Fridays being my regular EAT ALL THE THINGS day.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saturday went well. Sunday I felt like crap, I had a persistent headache (even after beef broth drinking). I slept pretty much through it, until I woke up at 23:00 feeling pretty good (figures, just when I needed to be going to bed for work).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today: my mouth tastes gross (yaaay acetone.../s), I&amp;#39;m thirsty as hell and peeing like a madwoman, and though I have not had a bunch of food to eat today I am &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; let me tell you what -- 12 almonds, less than 2 oz. each of summer sausage and colby jack for a snack, and then lunch was a ridiculously tasty low carb tortilla (5g net!) with turkey, spinach, cheese slices, a bit of orange bell pepper and a smidge of honey mustard (2g-ish carbs, maybe even 3 as an uber-upper-end).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Considering I stopped eating at 7 p.m. yesterday and started my morning at 8 a.m. this morning with my regular 8ish mile bike commute, that&amp;#39;s a pretty impressively small amount of food to make me as full as it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also: someone brought chocolate cupcakes today, and though I am usually&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(a) a free food whore&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(2) a chocolate whore&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(iii) a baked goods whore&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(d) without the slightest inkling of self control&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...I didn&amp;#39;t even &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; one of the suckers. And do not feel disappointed in the least that I did not &amp;quot;get&amp;quot; to eat one. Because I don&amp;#39;t care.

I'm not looking to OMFG LOSE TONS OF WEIGHT or anything (I'm 5'6 and like...135 lbs, I think, but a good chunk of that is muscle from cycling/former lifting). Just looking to shed that last wee bit of ab flab/hip fat/inner thigh squish, and it's gotten past the point of simple \"eat less calories,\" mostly because I have 0 self control.\n\nI tried Leangains and while I liked the IF (I still keep to a rough 16/8 schedule), the macro counting was not so much for me (AHHH I'M TOO HIGH ON THIS AND TOO LOW ON THIS AND OMFG /insane). And any diet that prohibits cheese is not one that I could possibly stick to (hell, for Christmas my mom got me a year-long subscription to Cheese of the Month club). And I lovelovelove reading about nutrition and fitness and different diets (when I say \"diet\" I mean more \"eating styles\" than I do \"weight loss plans). \n\nSo finally one day, Friday to be exact, I decided on something new. I decided on Friday that I was going to eat everything ever. Craptons of carbs. And then I was going to fast for the better part of Saturday. And Saturday night, I would start my first day of keto.\n\n(For the sake of sanity and other things, I'm aiming for CKD, with Fridays being my regular EAT ALL THE THINGS day.)\n\nSaturday went well. Sunday I felt like crap, I had a persistent headache (even after beef broth drinking). I slept pretty much through it, until I woke up at 23:00 feeling pretty good (figures, just when I needed to be going to bed for work).\n\nToday: my mouth tastes gross (yaaay acetone.../s), I'm thirsty as hell and peeing like a madwoman, and though I have not had a bunch of food to eat today I am *full* let me tell you what -- 12 almonds, less than 2 oz. each of summer sausage and colby jack for a snack, and then lunch was a ridiculously tasty low carb tortilla (5g net!) with turkey, spinach, cheese slices, a bit of orange bell pepper and a smidge of honey mustard (2g-ish carbs, maybe even 3 as an uber-upper-end).\n\nConsidering I stopped eating at 7 p.m. yesterday and started my morning at 8 a.m. this morning with my regular 8ish mile bike commute, that's a pretty impressively small amount of food to make me as full as it does.\n\nAlso: someone brought chocolate cupcakes today, and though I am usually\n\n(a) a free food whore\n\n(2) a chocolate whore\n\n(iii) a baked goods whore\n\n(d) without the slightest inkling of self control\n\n...I didn't even *want* one of the suckers. And do not feel disappointed in the least that I did not \"get\" to eat one. Because I don't care. Because dinner tonight is going to be salmon fillet and creamy goodness (I cannot believe I'm actually eating CREAM this is not something I have ever done before, except maybe at restaurants).\n\n(Although fairly unrelated, I would also like to note I gave the middle finger to conventional \"Don't make too many lifestyle changes at once\" advice and happened to quit smoking just two days before. Rocking at that too.)\n\nSo...thanks, /r/keto, for being here for me to lurk and stuff. And brag a bit.

My parents have been divorced for seven years and have joint, month-on/month off custody of my younger brother and sister, age 15 and 10 respectively. My dad has what I&amp;#39;m pretty sure is serious anger and control issues (but I&amp;#39;m not really going to get into that because I&amp;#39;m not a therapist) and basically yells at my sister ALL the time. He won&amp;#39;t let her wear her hair down, or wear shorts or tank tops. He won&amp;#39;t let her go to friend&amp;#39;s houses or have friends over. He won&amp;#39;t let her talk to our mom during his custody time AT ALL, and if he finds her talking to Mom on the phone or over Facebook or something, he loses it at her. He makes her cry almost every day. She hates living with Dad even part time, and never wants to leave Mom&amp;#39;s house. I do my best to keep Dad off her back, but I can&amp;#39;t be around 24/7 and it just drives me crazy to see the way he treats her. He literally cannot speak to her without yelling or giving her shit for something. To be fair, he&amp;#39;s never gotten physically abusive but he&amp;#39;s most definitely harming her emotionally and it&amp;#39;s heartbreaking to see. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was talking to my Mom about this yesterday, and she said she&amp;#39;s aware of it as my sister often calls her crying (despite not being allowed to). My mom doesn&amp;#39;t want to &amp;quot;rock the boat&amp;quot; and say anything to my Dad, or try and get full custody because of legal fees, etc. I think my sister is old enough now to say where she wants to live as she&amp;#39;s almost 11 years old but I don&amp;#39;t know enough about the legal system to say that for certainty. (If anyone does know about custody law in Canada, I&amp;#39;d love to hear what you think). Anyway, my mom doesn&amp;#39;t want to start shit even though my sister is suffering severe emotional damage, and when I&amp;#39;ve tried to speak up to my Dad about it he brushes me off and says &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not her parent, so just shut up about it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to help my sister. I can&amp;#39;t get my Dad to lay off, and my Mom won&amp;#39;t stand up for her. I love her more than anything and it&amp;#39;s killing me that my Dad is doing to her what he did to me (and what took years of therapy as an adult to overcome) and no one seems to care or want to do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any ideas on how I can help my sister?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Dad is emotionally abusive to younger sister, Mom refuses to stand up or speak out. How do I help her?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Holy everlasting hell, I am blown away by the amount of support and advice people have showered on me. Thanks so much all of you. :) I&amp;#39;m trying to respond to everyone, but if any posts get overlooked I&amp;#39;m very sorry. I&amp;#39;m planning to take J (my little sis) out on Wednesday and have a chat about stuff, and I&amp;#39;m also planning to sit my mother down and tell her in no uncertain terms that she needs to get involved and start fighting for her daughter&amp;#39;s happiness. I shall keep you all updated! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;#39;m pleasantly surprised by how very little trolling has been done. And thanks to those of you who shut down the few who did try to start shit. :) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Several people seem to think I&amp;#39;m a boy. Not that it really matters, but for clarity&amp;#39;s sake, I am indeed female. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 3: To be clear - my mom does not need financial aid to start a legal action. She makes good money, and so does my stepdad. She does not WANT to spend her money on legal action. It&amp;#39;s easier for her to ignore the problem. Also, I think she loves having six months of the year &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; from being a parent and doesn&amp;#39;t want to give that (or her four trips to Vegas a year) up. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media":null,"domain":"self.self","author_flair_css_class":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"ups":226,"link_flair_css_class":null,"selftext":"First off I'm not sure if I'm posting this in the right subreddit, so if I'm not, please let me know and I'll x-post it.\n\nK.\n\nSo I'm 25 and had to move back in with my dad a few months ago due to monetary issues.

He won't let her talk to our mom during his custody time AT ALL, and if he finds her talking to Mom on the phone or over Facebook or something, he loses it at her. He makes her cry almost every day. She hates living with Dad even part time, and never wants to leave Mom's house. I do my best to keep Dad off her back, but I can't be around 24/7 and it just drives me crazy to see the way he treats her. He literally cannot speak to her without yelling or giving her shit for something. To be fair, he's never gotten physically abusive but he's most definitely harming her emotionally and it's heartbreaking to see. \n\nI was talking to my Mom about this yesterday, and she said she's aware of it as my sister often calls her crying (despite not being allowed to). My mom doesn't want to \"rock the boat\" and say anything to my Dad, or try and get full custody because of legal fees, etc. I think my sister is old enough now to say where she wants to live as she's almost 11 years old but I don't know enough about the legal system to say that for certainty. (If anyone does know about custody law in Canada, I'd love to hear what you think). Anyway, my mom doesn't want to start shit even though my sister is suffering severe emotional damage, and when I've tried to speak up to my Dad about it he brushes me off and says \"You're not her parent, so just shut up about it.\"\n\nI don't know how to help my sister. I can't get my Dad to lay off, and my Mom won't stand up for her. I love her more than anything and it's killing me that my Dad is doing to her what he did to me (and what took years of therapy as an adult to overcome) and no one seems to care or want to do anything about it.\n\nAny ideas on how I can help my sister?\n\nTL;DR: Dad is emotionally abusive to younger sister, Mom refuses to stand up or speak out. How do I help her?\n\nEdit: Holy everlasting hell, I am blown away by the amount of support and advice people have showered on me. Thanks so much all of you. :) I'm trying to respond to everyone, but if any posts get overlooked I'm very sorry. I'm planning to take J (my little sis) out on Wednesday and have a chat about stuff, and I'm also planning to sit my mother down and tell her in no uncertain terms that she needs to get involved and start fighting for her daughter's happiness. I shall keep you all updated! \n\nAlso, I'm pleasantly surprised by how very little trolling has been done. And thanks to those of you who shut down the few who did try to start shit. :) \n\nEdit 2: Several people seem to think I'm a boy. Not that it really matters, but for clarity's sake, I am indeed female. \n\nEdit 3: To be clear - my mom does not need financial aid to start a legal action. She makes good money, and so does my stepdad. She does not WANT to spend her money on legal action. It's easier for her to ignore the problem. Also, I think she loves having six months of the year \"off\" from being a parent and doesn't want to give that (or her four trips to Vegas a year) up.

I just felt like there was empty space. I've always had to keep quiet about me being an Atheist, as my education depended on it. I've never told anyone except for you, reddit. Now enjoy while I slowly unfold my story of my life into this rather small textbox in this small world. \n\nWhen I first started Primary School, I was a believer until I reached around Year 4, (Grade 3 or whatever for you US people.) where I honestly started to question my beliefs. I was extremely interested about computers then, and I researched all about the big bang, what scientists believed happened, or the theory. I really began to question it, more and more when in about Year 5, I thought: If the big bang started with nothing, the first thing it would've created wouldn't have been a super-intelligent God like being that watched over absolutely everything to create everything.\n\nIf the Earth was made in 6 days, how could he have made billions of chemicals, chemical reactions, ores, elements... I have reason to believe that nowhere in the Bible does it say any of this happened. Did they just appear? And how did a gigantic gas ball of firey death randomly appear when he said 'Let there be light'? And Christians say the big bang was physically impossible? \n\nAnd I do personally believe in Multiverses, but I won't go into too much detail. I mean there may be a parallel universe where you didn't exist, I didn't exist, Reddit didn't exist! Who knows? Again, this is a theory but it's really cool to think about there being a universe where you can actually win 'The Game' (Okay, that was a joke.) The human imagination is infinite, science is infinite, anything COULD happen, and no, your life is not planned out, you're a free thinker.

I just felt like there was empty space. I&amp;#39;ve always had to keep quiet about me being an Atheist, as my education depended on it. I&amp;#39;ve never told anyone except for you, reddit. Now enjoy while I slowly unfold my story of my life into this rather small textbox in this small world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I first started Primary School, I was a believer until I reached around Year 4, (Grade 3 or whatever for you US people.) where I honestly started to question my beliefs. I was extremely interested about computers then, and I researched all about the big bang, what scientists believed happened, or the theory. I really began to question it, more and more when in about Year 5, I thought: If the big bang started with nothing, the first thing it would&amp;#39;ve created wouldn&amp;#39;t have been a super-intelligent God like being that watched over absolutely everything to create everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the Earth was made in 6 days, how could he have made billions of chemicals, chemical reactions, ores, elements... I have reason to believe that nowhere in the Bible does it say any of this happened. Did they just appear? And how did a gigantic gas ball of firey death randomly appear when he said &amp;#39;Let there be light&amp;#39;? And Christians say the big bang was physically impossible? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I do personally believe in Multiverses, but I won&amp;#39;t go into too much detail. I mean there may be a parallel universe where you didn&amp;#39;t exist, I didn&amp;#39;t exist, Reddit didn&amp;#39;t exist! Who knows? Again, this is a theory but it&amp;#39;s really cool to think about there being a universe where you can actually win &amp;#39;The Game&amp;#39; (Okay, that was a joke.) The human imagination is infinite, science is infinite, anything COULD happen, and no, your life is not planned out, you&amp;#39;re a free thinker. If you took the wrong way in your life, Jesus or God won&amp;#39;t save you, you will save yourself. Who knows how you will do it? But that&amp;#39;s the mystery of the entire universe, science, and 42.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I stated my education relies on religion, as I go to a Christian high school, it&amp;#39;s in the top 100 schools in England, if you didn&amp;#39;t make it in there you went to the closest public school, where it&amp;#39;s kind of a crumby school but my older cousin teaches there, as he&amp;#39;s in 6th Form in this school.

I never had any goals, any ambitions, any motivation. I masturbated once a day, sometimes more, it was a real addiction, I did it almost always with pornographic materials. I tried to stop, going on 5 days-nofap, but always relapsed, no motivation at all. I didn&amp;#39;t realize how serious my addiction was. I was lurking reddit for quite a long time then, and was subscribed to almost all NSFW subs. I was browsing reddit for hours and hours a day, but I discovered &lt;a href=\"/r/nofap\"&gt;/r/nofap&lt;/a&gt;, and I decided to lurk moar, and moar. I read about negative effects of masturbation and porn, and some of the arguments convinced me. Then I read successful stories of Fapstronauts, and I was like &amp;#39;wow, I want that too!&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;124 days ago I decided to stop permanently with this disgusting addiction by subscribing here, making a badge, and telling myself I am better than that: I AM A MAN. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why am I even doing this? Well, some of you may do it for the girls/women, or maybe because of ED, or any sexual related stuff. I am doing this to prove myself that I am better than a porn and masturbation addict. I wanted to prove myself I have a strong will. No addiction will be stronger than myself. Ever. Again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Days flew by, but on 22nd day I relapsed; without porn, I just had an urge, something triggered me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After my first relapse I was really depressed: 22 days for nothing. But I stayed strong; winners fall, but champions get up, right? I was working hard back then, 10hrs a day of physical job, I came tired back home, I had no energy at all, even for fapping. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first days/weeks were the toughest, these images kept flashing in my mind, I couldn&amp;#39;t forget that awesome dopamine rush of an orgasm (made artificially by myself). But as I worked hard, as I concentrated on my work, these thoughts begun to disappear. I concentrated myself on other things than false stimuli: that was the moment I began living in the REAL WORLD. I finally saw all the beautiful women on streets. My mind became open, no brain-fog anymore, I was clearheaded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The period of 2-6 weeks was energetic, I had more motivation to improve my life and to improve the world. I begun running, and went on my first serious run: I was running, and running, and couldn&amp;#39;t stop, I ran for an hour, and after that, I felt amazing. I was depressed that I was losing my life before nofap, because when I stopped masturbating I could finally make some space for other great activities: sport, work, education, music etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7 to 9 weeks I was flatlining; depression, anxiety, but I was strong, didn&amp;#39;t listen to that voice that kept telling me to masturbate (‘c’mon man, it’s awesome, and one time doesn’t matter!), I knew my triggers. I knew it will be gone, because I am withdrawing from masturbation and pornography, I knew I am withdrawing from dopamine (or other hormones that are involved into masturbation). It was a really inactive period for me, but I didn&amp;#39;t worry so much because this was a great opportunity for introspection; I was able to think about myself, what I did wrong in my life, what could I do better. In this period &lt;a href=\"/r/nofap\"&gt;/r/nofap&lt;/a&gt; was really helpful, many people motivated me, I asked questions, and people only responded with positive thoughts. Thank you once more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now, the twelfth week of not masturbating, and I feel great. My depression is gone, anxiety too, I am living healthy; I eat healthy food that I cook myself, I am doing a lot of sports (running, fitness, cycling, swimming), and I finally can see the world as it is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about girls? Nothing. I don&amp;#39;t feel any need to have a girlfriend, I am happy as I am now. A girlfriend would not disturb me, but I would rather like to concentrate on myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nofap helped me also with my cannabis addiction but I think that&amp;#39;s something to write about in another post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am really grateful for this subreddit, and I am happy to participate in this experiment; people knew masturbation for ages, but they didn&amp;#39;t knew it was either good or bad.
