I started at 19 (I&amp;#39;m 20 now), and I&amp;#39;m making good progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we see 19-year-old Olympians in the sport...and constantly hear people talking about how starting early is so imperative to the sport and how if you didn&amp;#39;t start at 13 you won&amp;#39;t go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I seem to have decent genetics for the sport (I went from a 200 lb squat to a 500+ lb squat in about 5 months and am very explosive). I&amp;#39;m also a dual-citizen of the USA and another country where the weightlifters clearly have access to various performance-enhancing drugs and have won gold medals in recent history. If I ever had the chance to lift at an international level, I would do so in the other country and would have no qualms about doping. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m 20 and I&amp;#39;m just afraid it&amp;#39;s too late. And the sport is a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; sacrifice for me--especially academically. I go to an Ivy League school and at the moment I&amp;#39;m doing the bare minimum to get my degree (I have a 4.0; by bare minimum I mean the courses required.

This last December I competed in the AAPF Viking Challenge, my first powerlifting meet. It was a pretty small meet, but everyone was really encouraging. In attendance were Scot Mendelson, Pavel Tsatsouline, and former Masters DL world record holder Kevin Fisher. Well, here goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few months out, I weighed 230lbs and I felt really fat. (I&amp;#39;m 6&amp;#39;2&amp;quot;; I fully plan on being reasonably lean at 220-230 by mid 2014, but I&amp;#39;ve got a while before then). My original plan was to drop to just below 198 and compete in that weight class. This required a somewhat aggressive caloric deficit, which ended up taking its toll on my lifts (most especially my deadlift; I hit a fairly easy 500 at 225 but struggled with 480 at the meet). Two weeks out I got a terrible bout of food poisoning and was shitting water for about five days. Believe me, I dropped to sub-198, but I was weak as hell. As soon as I recovered (about a week before), I went no-holds-barred on eating and weighed in at 209 while wearing clothes and shoes. My bathroom scale said 204 while I was naked, so I&amp;#39;ll just go with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I had a few other injuries leading into this meet. I had a mysterious lower back pain (which I still feel; I suspect it to be a minor L5/S1 herniation, but I haven&amp;#39;t had it examined yet). Also, I bought a 13mm Inzer Lever belt which cracked my rib because I cinched it too tight. That still hurts too but it doesn&amp;#39;t hamper my lifts except for bench. On top of this, my brachialis had been hurting from low bar squatting, so until one week out I trained only high bar squats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Meet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qg1NJYxRs0&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be\"&gt;Video of 5/9 attempts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Squat&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;165/363.8 - conservative opener, made it easily. I had hit this for a triple about six days out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;172.5/380.3 - slightly challenging. I had hit this for a single three days out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;185/407.9 - new PR, and I&amp;#39;m calling it my first 2xBW squat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Squats felt good, but I may have lowballed my numbers under the belief that performance anxiety would make me weaker. It didn&amp;#39;t, though--I felt great and may have been able to squat a few kilos more, but I&amp;#39;m just happy I made my attempts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bench:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;110/242.5 - This went up easily enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;117.5/259.0 - This went up slow (embarrassingly).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;125/275.6 &lt;strong&gt;fail&lt;/strong&gt;- Only failed attempt of the meet. I should have gone for 122.5 and just put a good number on the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bench kinda sucked because it took forever. A lot of people did single-event for the bench, including Scot Mendelson, who attempted something like 1070lb (equipped of course). Scot ended up taking about 45 mins to warm up, and he used the stage to do it. This ended up slowing down the meet a lot. This felt like a really conceited move on his part, even if he is the chair of the AAPF. But whatever, it gave me a good rest after squats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deadlift:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;200/440.9 - Again, conservative opener. I&amp;#39;d struggled to get 455 in the gym about a week before, so I was nervous about my DL at the meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;212.5/468.5 - Easy enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;217.5/479.5 - Actually something of a struggle. Losing weight took its toll on my deadlift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deadlift was fun because I got to warm up with Kevin Fisher, who deadlifted 305kg raw later that evening. Also, Pavel Tsatsouline was there to coach his 70+ year old father, Vladimir Tsatsouline. Vladimir ended up deadlifting 185kg, which was extremely impressive to watch (I didn&amp;#39;t think to get it on video). While I was warming up, Pavel was offering his dad some chalk. I was standing about a foot away and he asked if I wanted some chalk, too. I told him sure, I&amp;#39;d love some. After I chalked up and handed him the block, he said (completely deadpan) &amp;quot;Coffee? Tea?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a tiny meet and I was the only one in my weight class. I walked away with a golden viking trophy (sweet) and a lot of encouragement from the other lifters--some first-timers, some veterans. However, while this was a great time, it made me long to compete in my true interest which is Olympic weightlifting. I will continue to train in powerlifting for a while, but it&amp;#39;s not quite as exciting as Oly for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cool stuff I saw that wasn&amp;#39;t directly related to my lifts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Tsatsouline, age 74, deadlifting 185kg.

{"created_utc":1357079031,"author_flair_css_class":null,"selftext":"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. \n\nI grew up in a moderately Christian family. My parents are both Christians who attended church regularly, read the Bible and tried to live the good Christian life. However, they were not born-again Christians. In the last 3 or so years, their faith (according to them) has gotten stronger and they decided to get re-baptized and now consider themselves born again Christians.\n\nI am not born-again. I believe the Bible to be true, I love attending church and I trust that there is a God. However, I have many questions and concerns about the way Christianity is today and I also have many questions about the horrible things we see in the world today. Even though I believe there is a God, I am unable to submit myself completely to Him because there are often times where I get angry with God or just don't feel like He is the way forward. This; at least to me, is not a very Christian thing to do, and unless I am able to reconcile all the issues I have with God, it would be unwise for me to actually become born-again.\n\nNow that you have a bit of a background on my parents and myself, I can start getting more detailed about the problem I face.\n\nMy mom is an extremely controlling woman. She reads the Bible all day long, prays like 10 times a day, and every other word out of her mouth is about either Jesus, God or the Bible. In the past few years, she has ceased to be my mother, and I often just see her as a preacher in church. Every time I talk to her about even the simplest things, the conversation undoubtedly drifts to religion. I am uncomfortable speaking to her about my life and the problems I face on a regular basis because in addition to being very controlling, she is also highly judgmental. She believes that al the issues I face are because I don't have God and because I am not born-again. \n\nHere are some examples of how she is controlling:\n\nI am 23 and I still have to give her a complete account of what I do when I go outside. She gets upset with me if I come home late, if I don't speak to her or tell her what I did and she especially gets upset if I am out with girls. I don't have a girlfriend any longer and the one I did have (for 5 years), had to leave me because my mom was uncomfortable with our relationship. She called my girlfriend's parents one fine day and told them to keep their daughter away from me. All this occurred unbeknownst to me and I was shocked when my gf broke up with me. This was over 2 years ago and I still have not been able to come to terms with this. Internally, I still hate my mom for doing that to me. Unfortunately, after that incident, my parents have realized my weakness. They know now that if they do shit behind my back, I will be completely clueless to it. They often threaten to call my friends and tell them what a horrible son I am. They threaten to expose things I have told them in confidence to my friends, so (in their words) my friends can see what a horrible guy I am and how they shouldn't associate with me. Man my life is fucked up.\n\nShe frequently calls me a bad son, wishes she had another son, compares me to other guys of similar age, and even compares me to Biblical characters. On a number of occasions, she has called me Satan. I don't believe I am a bad person. I just graduated from university with dreams of one day becoming a dentist. I was unable to afford the fees for dental school and so I am not working so I can save up some money. My typical day is work, eat, sleep. I don't go out because I don't have any close friends, mainly because I have never had the opportunity to socialize with others. My social skills are terrible and although I try really hard to become better, I simply find it difficult because it is completely new territory to me. I try to help out around the house as much as I can and I pay my own bills (except rent- but more on this later).\n\nNow my dad. My dad is a decent guy, he has had a hard life and has made many sacrifices in his life to get where he is today. However, his one weakness is my mom. He is whipped. He does basically what she says. He ALWAYS defends her no matter what, even when she is screaming at him. Often, then sit down to discuss the Bible (no surprise eh?) and my mom actually ends up getting mad at him because he sometimes challenges her conclusions of what some verses mean. (I should mention that this is one major problem I have with religion - stuff gets interpreted in so many ways and it's hard to argue with people like my mom who call themselves the real Christians, and refuse to listen to any one else). Whenever my mom and I argue about anything, my dad jumps in her defense and starts to yell at me. On a number of occasions, he's beaten me with a variety of objects, but nothing too severe. \n\nA major problem I face with my parents is trust. When I was younger (in my late teens), I used to be very open with my parents. I told them a lot of things about my life, my few friends, and what we did. I even told them intimate details about my friends' lives; for example when my friend was trying to quit alcohol or when my friend's parent's had a divorce or when my muslim friend's father beat her for dating a non-muslim guy, etc. I trusted my parents and often got advice from them, which I then took back to my friends to help them out. All this was before they became Christian.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed after my parents became Christians was they they frequently brought up those things I had told them in confidence and used them against me. For example: they said that the reason I didn't want to be a Christian was because all my friends were non-Christians and that I should stop hanging out with that filthy crowd. Also, they said stuff like how my friends parents probably got a divorce because they don't have God in their lives and that my friend got beat up by her father because she had spoken back to him, and thus deserved the punishment. All of these things not only generated an intense hate in be (because they were breaking my trust) but also rage because I had felt so bad for my friends who were undergoing such things, and here my parents were justifying them. How could Christians do this?\n\nMy mom is also very judgemental of others. EVen sometimes when we get back from church, she always talks negatively about the people we saw or met. Oh did you see so and so...did you know her cousin is a lesbian? Or did you see him...did you know that his mom is greedy and arrogant and only cares about money? My mom has an intense hate for other religions and cannot seem to understand that in this world, we must respect others and their choices, not hate them because their choices are not the same as ours. In fact, my parents both do not get this concept. They always spew hate against non-Christians, and I guess it doesn't help that my friends are non-Christians.\n\nFinally, in one last way my mom and dad control me is by using their health. You see, my mom has diabetes and anemia and my dad has a number of things like thyroid problems, high BP and digestive issues. Nothing debilitating although my mom gets tired quickly and has to take many pills everyday. Overall, they are okay not bed-ridden or anything. However, they use their health issues as a way to guilt trip me into doing what they want, and also make me out to be a bad son for upsetting them. Just a few days back, my mom was upset with me that I had bought us a new TV. It was a Christmas present for the family and I knew it was a little on the extravagant side. Instead of happiness, they both got upset. They got pissed and told me to think of all the poor, starving children. They told me that my lack of Jesus was resulting in arrogance and pride, which is why I was making such extravagant purchases (the TV cost 370 bucks btw). They told me that I had better have kept the receipt. I got pissed off and told them that they should be thankful to God that their son has been blessed this way and by extension, they too are blessed. My meaning was they that should be thankful that we can afford such things, and we buy them not because we are proud or arrogant, but just as a small luxury. They both got upset about this and told me that as a non-Christian, how dare I use God to make an argument. They yelled at me for always bringing pain to them, and for worsening my mom's health. My dad blamed me for his hypertension and for making life hell for them. All because I brought a TV. \n\nAs I am typing this, those of you who have made it this far (kudos btw) are probably thinking that I am a horrible son. I am even smiling myself as I try to figure out how I can show you guys that I'm not a bad kid. I really don't know what I am doing wrong. My only issue is that I am not a born-again Christian. Otherwise, I am just a normal human being; honest.\n\nI told my parents that I want to move out because apparently I am hurting them and they are making life miserable for me. I just want to be on my own. My parents responded that I needed to go see a church counsellor and get some mental help because I was talking nonsense. Then they guilt-tripped me by saying that I was a horrible son who just couldnt wait to abandon his family and leave. I responded that I wasn't doing this my choice, that I didnt enjoy throwing my money away on rent, but that this was a decision I was being forced to make due to their controlling ways. We haven't argued since then but I have already started my search for a place to rent. \n\nAlthough I worry a little about my parents, a little bit of survival instincts have kicked in and I am just trying to look out for myself now. I want to know whether what I am doing is right or wrong? Is it wrong of me to want to make a life by myself, to leave home and to build something based on my own decisions? I'm fucking 23 years old and I still struggle to do shit for myself, struggle to fit in socially, struggle to make friend and to talk to people. I feel that every single day I stay home, it's getting worse for me because my time is running out. Even their time comes, my parents will pass on and I will be left here on earth, with no knowledge or experience because I was never given the chance. \n\nWhat the hell should I do?\n\nHow do I make them see reason? How can I tell them that their belief that they are real Christians is wrong. That this is now the Christianity that Jesus intended. They are twisting the true message of Christ into something that believe is correct.\n\nI fucking hate my life. I hate where I live, I hate the way my parents are. I hate their controlling and overprotective bullshit. I hate their judgmental attitudes. I hate the blackmail and guilt-tripping. I wish I didn't have to fucking live on this world anymore.\n\nBut I am not crazy. I don;t plan on killing myself or doing anything ridiculous like that. I know that this is the life I have been given and I'll live it as best I can. I just want ot do the right things.\n\nThank you for reading this jumbled up garbage wall of text. I don't expect a single person to actually make it this far, but if you have, you have my deepest thanks and appreciation. Wish you all a happy new years.\n\nR","downs":0,"retrieved_on":1413240178,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh6c","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/15sgtv/please_help_me_out_long_post/","title":"Please help me out [Long Post]","banned_by":null,"subreddit":"Christianity","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"score":0,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway account for obvious reasons. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a moderately Christian family.

Man my life is fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She frequently calls me a bad son, wishes she had another son, compares me to other guys of similar age, and even compares me to Biblical characters. On a number of occasions, she has called me Satan. I don&amp;#39;t believe I am a bad person. I just graduated from university with dreams of one day becoming a dentist. I was unable to afford the fees for dental school and so I am not working so I can save up some money. My typical day is work, eat, sleep. I don&amp;#39;t go out because I don&amp;#39;t have any close friends, mainly because I have never had the opportunity to socialize with others. My social skills are terrible and although I try really hard to become better, I simply find it difficult because it is completely new territory to me. I try to help out around the house as much as I can and I pay my own bills (except rent- but more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now my dad. My dad is a decent guy, he has had a hard life and has made many sacrifices in his life to get where he is today. However, his one weakness is my mom. He is whipped. He does basically what she says. He ALWAYS defends her no matter what, even when she is screaming at him. Often, then sit down to discuss the Bible (no surprise eh?) and my mom actually ends up getting mad at him because he sometimes challenges her conclusions of what some verses mean. (I should mention that this is one major problem I have with religion - stuff gets interpreted in so many ways and it&amp;#39;s hard to argue with people like my mom who call themselves the real Christians, and refuse to listen to any one else). Whenever my mom and I argue about anything, my dad jumps in her defense and starts to yell at me. On a number of occasions, he&amp;#39;s beaten me with a variety of objects, but nothing too severe. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A major problem I face with my parents is trust. When I was younger (in my late teens), I used to be very open with my parents. I told them a lot of things about my life, my few friends, and what we did. I even told them intimate details about my friends&amp;#39; lives; for example when my friend was trying to quit alcohol or when my friend&amp;#39;s parent&amp;#39;s had a divorce or when my muslim friend&amp;#39;s father beat her for dating a non-muslim guy, etc. I trusted my parents and often got advice from them, which I then took back to my friends to help them out. All this was before they became Christian.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I noticed after my parents became Christians was they they frequently brought up those things I had told them in confidence and used them against me. For example: they said that the reason I didn&amp;#39;t want to be a Christian was because all my friends were non-Christians and that I should stop hanging out with that filthy crowd. Also, they said stuff like how my friends parents probably got a divorce because they don&amp;#39;t have God in their lives and that my friend got beat up by her father because she had spoken back to him, and thus deserved the punishment. All of these things not only generated an intense hate in be (because they were breaking my trust) but also rage because I had felt so bad for my friends who were undergoing such things, and here my parents were justifying them. How could Christians do this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom is also very judgemental of others. EVen sometimes when we get back from church, she always talks negatively about the people we saw or met. Oh did you see so and so...did you know her cousin is a lesbian? Or did you see him...did you know that his mom is greedy and arrogant and only cares about money? My mom has an intense hate for other religions and cannot seem to understand that in this world, we must respect others and their choices, not hate them because their choices are not the same as ours. In fact, my parents both do not get this concept. They always spew hate against non-Christians, and I guess it doesn&amp;#39;t help that my friends are non-Christians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, in one last way my mom and dad control me is by using their health. You see, my mom has diabetes and anemia and my dad has a number of things like thyroid problems, high BP and digestive issues. Nothing debilitating although my mom gets tired quickly and has to take many pills everyday. Overall, they are okay not bed-ridden or anything. However, they use their health issues as a way to guilt trip me into doing what they want, and also make me out to be a bad son for upsetting them. Just a few days back, my mom was upset with me that I had bought us a new TV. It was a Christmas present for the family and I knew it was a little on the extravagant side. Instead of happiness, they both got upset. They got pissed and told me to think of all the poor, starving children. They told me that my lack of Jesus was resulting in arrogance and pride, which is why I was making such extravagant purchases (the TV cost 370 bucks btw). They told me that I had better have kept the receipt. I got pissed off and told them that they should be thankful to God that their son has been blessed this way and by extension, they too are blessed. My meaning was they that should be thankful that we can afford such things, and we buy them not because we are proud or arrogant, but just as a small luxury. They both got upset about this and told me that as a non-Christian, how dare I use God to make an argument. They yelled at me for always bringing pain to them, and for worsening my mom&amp;#39;s health. My dad blamed me for his hypertension and for making life hell for them. All because I brought a TV. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I am typing this, those of you who have made it this far (kudos btw) are probably thinking that I am a horrible son. I am even smiling myself as I try to figure out how I can show you guys that I&amp;#39;m not a bad kid. I really don&amp;#39;t know what I am doing wrong. My only issue is that I am not a born-again Christian. Otherwise, I am just a normal human being; honest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told my parents that I want to move out because apparently I am hurting them and they are making life miserable for me. I just want to be on my own. My parents responded that I needed to go see a church counsellor and get some mental help because I was talking nonsense. Then they guilt-tripped me by saying that I was a horrible son who just couldnt wait to abandon his family and leave. I responded that I wasn&amp;#39;t doing this my choice, that I didnt enjoy throwing my money away on rent, but that this was a decision I was being forced to make due to their controlling ways. We haven&amp;#39;t argued since then but I have already started my search for a place to rent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although I worry a little about my parents, a little bit of survival instincts have kicked in and I am just trying to look out for myself now. I want to know whether what I am doing is right or wrong? Is it wrong of me to want to make a life by myself, to leave home and to build something based on my own decisions? I&amp;#39;m fucking 23 years old and I still struggle to do shit for myself, struggle to fit in socially, struggle to make friend and to talk to people. I feel that every single day I stay home, it&amp;#39;s getting worse for me because my time is running out. Even their time comes, my parents will pass on and I will be left here on earth, with no knowledge or experience because I was never given the chance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the hell should I do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do I make them see reason? How can I tell them that their belief that they are real Christians is wrong. That this is now the Christianity that Jesus intended. They are twisting the true message of Christ into something that believe is correct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fucking hate my life. I hate where I live, I hate the way my parents are. I hate their controlling and overprotective bullshit. I hate their judgmental attitudes. I hate the blackmail and guilt-tripping. I wish I didn&amp;#39;t have to fucking live on this world anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I am not crazy. I don;t plan on killing myself or doing anything ridiculous like that. I know that this is the life I have been given and I&amp;#39;ll live it as best I can. I just want ot do the right things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this jumbled up garbage wall of text. I don&amp;#39;t expect a single person to actually make it this far, but if you have, you have my deepest thanks and appreciation. Wish you all a happy new years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;R&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","domain":"self.Christianity","author":"randomshit12345","user_reports":[],"mod_reports":[],"num_comments":3,"permalink":"/r/Christianity/comments/15sgtv/please_help_me_out_long_post/","secure_media_embed":{},"ups":0,"report_reasons":null,"media":null,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"media_embed":{},"is_self":true,"edited":false,"id":"15sgtv","thumbnail":"self","secure_media":null}

After unsuccessfully trying Zoloft and Paxil, I started taking Celexa when I was about 15. I stayed on Celexa until I was about 26, then tried Cymbalta (very unsuccessfully) and finally switched to Lexapro. I&amp;#39;ve been on 10 mg of Lexapro for a couple of years, and I also have a Klonopin prescription to use as needed. I also take Inderal LA and Lisinopril Hctz for blood pressure, Prilosec, Zantac (a recent addition), and generic Allergra. I had to have back surgery about a year and a half ago following a car accident, and started using medical marijuana for the pain around April 2011. I had never tried marijuana before, and eventually became a daily smoker from about May 2011 to the end of October 2012. I quit right around November 1 because it was starting to mess with my anxiety, mostly because of the fact that it raised my heart rate, which has always been a trigger for me. I quit cold turkey and have been marijuana-free for two months today. I am in psychoanalysis four days a week, but my therapist has been on vacation for the holidays and I won&amp;#39;t see her until Thursday, and I genuinely feel like I&amp;#39;m losing my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been having an uptick in anxiety since a week or so before I stopped smoking. For the few months prior, I was doing extremely well and making tons of progress. I won&amp;#39;t say my anxiety was gone, but it was the most controlled it&amp;#39;s ever been. I can&amp;#39;t say how much of this was due to my daily marijuana habit, but it&amp;#39;s kind of irrelevant, because I&amp;#39;m not going back. ANYWAY, it seems like I did a complete 180 at the end of October, and I don&amp;#39;t know why, but it&amp;#39;s getting worse by the day. My theory is that I was using marijuana to cope with and stuff down my anxiety for a year and a half, and now all the things I was shoving aside are coming back with a vengeance. My brain feels like it&amp;#39;s constantly running, and I&amp;#39;m having difficulty sleeping. I&amp;#39;ve become significantly depressed, and very agoraphobic to boot. I have an amazing, supportive husband, but the poor man is going to lose his mind too if I can&amp;#39;t get a handle on this soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The worst part of all of this, by far, is the health anxiety. I&amp;#39;ve always been a bit of a hypochondriac, but things have gotten very, very bad. I caught a stomach virus that was going around (and my husband got it too), and ended up in the ER with dehydration. That should&amp;#39;ve been the end of it, but a stool sample revealed lots of white cells in my stool, and for the last three weeks, I&amp;#39;ve had severe and constant nausea and absolutely no appetite. I&amp;#39;m forcing myself to eat now, but I lost 15 pounds in two weeks (which is not a bad thing for someone my size, but that&amp;#39;s not the way to do it). I&amp;#39;ve been to urgent care once, the ER three times, and stayed overnight in the hospital once. I need to have an upper GI scope and colonoscopy, but because of the holidays I haven&amp;#39;t had a chance to schedule them yet. I should mention that my stomach issues have long been an anxiety trigger for me, so the constant nausea, indigestion, abdominal pain, and diarrhea have been screwing with my anxiety even more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Problem is, I don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s anything actually wrong with me or if it&amp;#39;s all in my head. The white blood cells mysteriously disappeared from my body, and admittedly, I&amp;#39;ve had stomach problems for years. But for some reason, I am completely convinced that there is something seriously wrong with me and that I&amp;#39;m going to die. I&amp;#39;ve been on a lot of antibiotics in the last year for various infections, and I&amp;#39;m afraid that I&amp;#39;ve done some serious damage. I&amp;#39;m also convinced there&amp;#39;s something catastrophically wrong with my heart, even though I&amp;#39;m on blood pressure medication and have had a normal stress echocardiogram, as well as a battery of other tests (all normal except for elevated cholesterol). (Full disclosure: I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;7&amp;quot; and about 280 pounds, down from a high of 325, so heart problems are not completely out of the realm of possibility.) For the last couple of months, I&amp;#39;ve been living in constant fear of having a heart attack or some kind of life-threatening infection or illness. I&amp;#39;m basically at the doctor once a week or more, and I&amp;#39;m driving myself (and my husband) completely insane. Any twinge I feel becomes an emergency in my head, especially if I start Googling my symptoms, which I try (and usually fail) to avoid. I&amp;#39;m also afraid to do any kind of activity, because I&amp;#39;m so afraid that if I raise my heart rate, I&amp;#39;ll have a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any help they can give or advice to impart on how to deal with this horrible uptick in anxiety, the insane health anxiety/hypochondria, and/or the marijuana withdrawal, I would really appreciate it. I would not actually kill myself, but the thoughts have definitely been there, and I&amp;#39;ve been VERY fixated on death. (I&amp;#39;m afraid now that it&amp;#39;s going to be a self-fulfilling prophecy and I&amp;#39;m going to think myself into a heart attack.) Again, I&amp;#39;ll see my therapist on Thursday, but I honestly feel like I&amp;#39;m going crazy, and I feel helpless and like I can&amp;#39;t handle it any longer.

Should I end this and continue with my search for the person of my dreams? Any advice would be great. Questions are more than welcome because as I said, I know I am not the great at explaining things thoroughly enough to be fully understood.

While having beaten incredible odds, we've done our fair share of fucking up. This will be mostly about myself, but having been with my wife for over 16 years now, my marriage and my family and my wife take up a significant portion of that story. So here goes.\n\nI was born in San Diego, California, and even as a small child I knew I was lucky to be growing up in paradise. I visited my grandparents in Phoenix one summer and asked why people didn't go to the beach since it was so hot all the time. I felt sympathy when I was told there was no ocean there. I loved San Diego. This is important. \n\nI had a pretty normal elementary school situation, wasn't popular, wasn't not popular, I was smart, things went well but not exceptional. I did however make the notable decision at the age of 12 to skip going to my local junior high and instead get on a bus at 6:30am to get sent off across town to a much better school in a terrible neighborhood with a computers program. This is also important.\n\nAt any rate, when I was 15, during the summer between 9th and 10th grade, I was informed that my family and I would be moving to Denver not long after the upcoming Christmas. This was not news that I welcomed. I'd had a few girlfriends by this point (five during my freshman year alone, so I had a pretty active social life), and was enjoying playing in my awful garage band. Because I was young and 6 months was a long time, I generally just played this up to my advantage to get free stuff from my male friends and attention from my female friends.\n\nThat is, until the week after Thanksgiving in 1994, when my parents flew to Denver to look for a house, and I stayed over with a friend and rode the bus with him to school (I'd chosen to attend far-away high school as well). \n\nThen my life changed forever, and I promise it's not in the way you think.\n\nMy friend introduced me to a girl that week who would eventually impact my life in some big ways. I won't give a ton of story for this part though because it's not super relevant except:\n\n* We started dating with exactly 30 days to go before I moved away, which at 15 and at the height of one's pretention, seems very cinematic and tragic and lends the whole thing a very fated/Romeo and Juliet kind of thing, which wasn't the kind of emotional shit I really needed to handle at that moment in time.\n* She was my first semi-sexual partner (I've never known how to classify this, she gave me oral and I fingered her but that was the extent of it. Not sure if that means I was a virgin after that or not.)\n* She broke up with me the day after Valentines Day after I'd moved because she'd already kissed some other boy. We'd of course written awful poetry to each other, spoken about marriage, decided we were soul mates, had plans for children, what our jobs would be, where we'd live, etc. by this point and that's how our relationship ended, that time.\n* We remained in this unhealthy non-friends, non-enemies, non-dating but on and off nonsense as periodically more than friends for a couple years, even while we both were relatively involved with other people. Unsurprisingly at this point, this is also important.\n\nMy move to Colorado was tough but ultimately I found many new friends (even if we were the weirdos who looked like Robert Smith and Morrissey), a new band, a new core group of people I still talk with to this day, and many girls, including the amazing one who'd become my wife. She was a friend of the girl I was dating at the time. She said something to someone about my girlfriend having a \"vaginal wrench\" on me, and that she'd vowed to have me by the end of the year. She had me within two weeks.\n\nYou see, since I was very little, girls were an obsession for me. I never had that \"girls are gross\" stage, I pretty much always wanted to be around them and as I got older I pretty much always wanted to be inside them. And the two I slept with by the time I was 17 obliged frequently and sometimes acrobatically. I often wish for my own 18-year old virility back, but I digress. Let it be made clear here that the two girls I'd slept with (as in PIV sexytimes) includes the girl who'd become my wife. While the girl she'd \"stolen\" me from and I fought constantly and had real issues with jealousy and clinginess (mostly on my part), I found that this new girl (call her K) and I didn't fight at all. We just didn't, and really still don't. We'd discuss any issues that came up an talk them through. Everything was great, we got along really, really well. Too well, in fact. Her mom had a hard time dealing with her divorce and was essentially a unipolar depressed person who did nothing but work at her job and watch TV. She wasn't the most attentive woman around, which was gold for a 17-year old boy and his hot 16-year old girlfriend who wants nothing more than to fuck him. She had to convince me it was time to have sex, I was very cautious and didn't want to jump into things, but of course we did.\n\nAnd being moronic teenagers who believe they are invincible, of course we got her pregnant.\n\nFinding out about this was no picnic, as you can imagine. We were trying to find a place to eat, it was our 1 year anniversary which also tends to fall on homecoming (long story) and at dinner, she kept running to the bathroom to throw up, which has been turned out to be a clear sign that my wife is pregnant ever since.\n\nI'd started art school by this point, but after much discussion and crying and explaining to our parents, we decided to have the baby. I went to school and worked a combined 15 hours a day some days, she worked at Target, and we lived together at her mothers house for about a year and a half. \n\nI eventually got a good job in my field that paid me a salary, we moved out into our own apartment, and we got married about 18 months after our son was born. We waited to get married, which I think was a really smart decision, because we didn't want to rush into a marriage and eventually feel obligated to each other in more ways than our son if a relationship between us didn't work out. It was a good move, I think, even if it did confuse my son when he was old enough to do the math between our number of years married and his age. (\"Wait, but I'm 13. That means you've been married 13 years, right?\" \"Uh, no.\")\n\nWe had a young and growing family, we had ups and downs financially, I lost jobs and insurance, the economy tanked, I supported us on freelance and unemployment. While I worked for one particular shitty company, we had our second child when our oldest was three despite the fact that my employer never paid my insurance premiums, unbeknownst to us, and so our baby's delivery and my wife's pre-natal care were not covered. This led to terrible debt issues, which led to us paying rent late regularly. We needed co-signers for car loans, we had our phones shut off routinely, and through it all, we loved each other, supported each other and in general made a happy life out of a hard one by loving each other and our children. When our son was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 5, incurring a life-altering set of instructions for how to care for him to keep him alive, we didn't have health insurance for his hospitalization and incurred a $38,000 hospital bill, and despite it all, we rolled with those punches, too.\n\nHaving received her GED, my wife attended nursing aid school and went to work overnight at a hospital. Let me preface that I'm not blaming her being gone at night for what I'm going to tell you about what I did next,. but it explains how I had the time and what kind of environment I was in. \n\nYou see, about when she went to work at the hospital, our marriage had devolved a bit, as the above paragraph might lead you to expect:\n\n* Since we had been together since we were essentially children and hadn't had much time to mature independently, we were emotionally enmeshed and incredibly co-dependent, as a therapist would later point out.\n* We just always had to deal with lots of money problems, which only got worse and worse and worse when my son went to the hospital.\n* We developed trust issues, I was snooping through her email and she mine, and at this time I became inappropriately close friends with an ex girlfriend. The one from before, from California. The one I'd had unhealthy and bone-headed obsessions with for years and years. That one.\n* We had two children under 5 who were incredibly spirited did not particularly get along\n* We dealt with sleep deprivation, mood swings, depression, anxiety, passive aggressiveness, codependency.\n* On top of all of this, we spent 5 nights a week apart. We still had sex quite frequently, but our intimacy was threadbare.\n\nPretty clearly here, I did some dumb shit. Like, really dumb shit. Shit that I would not be able to take if I had to live though it again. \n\nShit that in a fucked up way saved my marriage.\n\nSee, I entered into an emotional affair with (surprise!) the previously mentioned ex girlfriend, the one from before my big move. The one I never got out of my life despite my friends hating her, despite my wife insisting this woman still had a thing for me, the woman I'd been convinced at one point I was going to marry had I not \"been trapped by my wife and kids into this life\". \n\nThis woman was getting married soon, and had her doubts about that. We discussed our relationships in intimate detail which led to the inevitable \"we could treat each other so much better than our spouses are\". We didn't care what our spouses would have thought about it, we were only in it for ourselves and had tons of ways to justify what we were doing. We started sending insane amounts of text messages, we employed secret email accounts, all-day IMing while we were at work, all- night phone calls while my wife was at work... It was bad. \n\nThe only way I can describe living with myself while behaving this way is: compartmentalization. I could alternatively turn on and off the self devoted to my wife and family and the self devoted to my affair. I could post all day about this and I bet it's where most of my questions come from. Some points from above that played into this behavior besides a complete lack of love for myself, respect for my wife, and mental clarity:\n\n* I had a soft-spot in my heart for my hometown San Diego (still do) and she was a connection back to a time I saw as before my life fell apart. Before I'd been moved against my will, before I knocked someone up, before I would have needed to scrape snow off my car in the morning.\n* The affair took place exactly 10 years after our initial whirlwind Christmastime fling in high school and somehow that made it seem just as poetic or justified or meant to be or something equally self-serving and disgusting. It was easy to slip back into that ill-fated, star-cross'd lovers mindset and step outside of everyday life.\n* I had spent a lot of time missing that 16-year old I fell in love with and got pregnant while simultaneously resenting the 23-year old stressed out wife and mother she'd become. At my hands, admittedly, but that wasn't important to me at the time. I told you it was fucked up.\n* I was not capable of communicating my needs to my wife because I didn't feel she was capable of hearing them, so I told my ex instead and she told me about her unmet needs and we decided to be each other's \"fun\" secret. When some issue got heated between us (she wanted to get presents for my kids, and I wouldn't let her, for instance), we'd cool it off by reminding ourselves that we were the \"fun ones\".\n\nThe sequence of events for Christmas 2004 was:\n\n* Early Christmas morning - my wife leaves town to visit her sister on a pre-planned trip\n* Christmas evening - I take my kids to Denny's for dinner and get incredibly depressed and thoughtful about  what I was about to do, and what would happen to my life because of it.\n* Day after Christmas - I take my kids to my parents' house and drive directly to the airport, where I pick up the woman I had up until this point been having an emotional affair with.\n* The next 24 hours - proceed to take this emotional affair into the physical realm.\n* Evening of December 27 - send my mistress home\n* New Year's Eve - pick up my wife from her trip\n\nWhat you need to understand is: my wife is truly amazing. It's at this point in the story, where I really truly realized just how amazing. When she found out that the Christmas trip I'd sent her on to see her sister included my ex-girlfriend coming to town and spending 24 hours with me at a hotel downtown, she didn't throw me out. She was beyond angry, to be sure, but she didn't throw me out. She said she wasn't done with me yet. She came close to being done with me many, many times, but she never did. This can be attributed to about 12 million things, but mostly:\n\n* Seriously, we really do love each other\n* Lots of therapy\n* Lots of therapy\n* Appropriately-medicated mental health\n* I worked my ass off to prove to her just how re-devoted I was to us. I wasn't great at first but I got the hang of it.\n\nWe worked on ourselves a lot over the next few years, and separated once for a total of 24 hours. She demanded I quit smoking to prove I had future plans with her and my children, and I did. Her mother moved in and helped manage the household while our marriage swept back and forth between stability and chaos. We cried a lot, we yelled a lot, we fucked a lot (we've always done that though). Once when things were back on a good track, I mentioned once how much I regretted doing what I'd done, and my wife said \"I don't, if you hadn't had an affair, we wouldn't have been forced to look at ourselves and fix things. Your affair saved our marriage.\" And while I agree, I certainly can't say it's the best way to go about things.\n\nAnd here we are. Our son is 14 and in high school himself. Our daughter is 11 and in middle school. We have a 4-year old who is incredible. My mother in law has moved out, I am finally at the very top of my career and field (remember that whole computer school thing?), my wife is a full-fledged nurse, one of the best at her work. She still works five nights a week but that isn't a problem in the slightest because of how we treat each other the rest of the time. We make well into the 6 figures and can provide things for our children and ourselves we never even dreamed of. I've been to New Zealand, New York, Iceland, Hungary, Ireland, Amsterdam and more for work and travel has always been something I love and without my wife's support and love I wouldn't have been able to accomplish half of what I have. I had to realize it's because of them that my life is great, not in spite of them. I'm not perfect but I'm working on being the best dad I can be and the best husband I can be and things are working out pretty well. To anyone who sees a bit of themselves in the chaos above, I'm proof that things can work out, even when you fuck up.\n\nAnyway, there it is in abridged form, the full thing takes much longer to tell.\n\n**TLDR: Dude knocks up girlfriend in high school, marries her, fucks his ex-girlfriend, rebuilds his marriage**\n\nedit: formatting","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1357072389,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"link_flair_text":null,"subreddit":"AMA","banned_by":null,"title":"I'm a 33 year old male who at 18 knocked up his 16-year old girlfriend.

While having beaten incredible odds, we&amp;#39;ve done our fair share of fucking up. This will be mostly about myself, but having been with my wife for over 16 years now, my marriage and my family and my wife take up a significant portion of that story. So here goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was born in San Diego, California, and even as a small child I knew I was lucky to be growing up in paradise. I visited my grandparents in Phoenix one summer and asked why people didn&amp;#39;t go to the beach since it was so hot all the time. I felt sympathy when I was told there was no ocean there. I loved San Diego. This is important. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a pretty normal elementary school situation, wasn&amp;#39;t popular, wasn&amp;#39;t not popular, I was smart, things went well but not exceptional. I did however make the notable decision at the age of 12 to skip going to my local junior high and instead get on a bus at 6:30am to get sent off across town to a much better school in a terrible neighborhood with a computers program. This is also important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At any rate, when I was 15, during the summer between 9th and 10th grade, I was informed that my family and I would be moving to Denver not long after the upcoming Christmas. This was not news that I welcomed. I&amp;#39;d had a few girlfriends by this point (five during my freshman year alone, so I had a pretty active social life), and was enjoying playing in my awful garage band. Because I was young and 6 months was a long time, I generally just played this up to my advantage to get free stuff from my male friends and attention from my female friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is, until the week after Thanksgiving in 1994, when my parents flew to Denver to look for a house, and I stayed over with a friend and rode the bus with him to school (I&amp;#39;d chosen to attend far-away high school as well). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then my life changed forever, and I promise it&amp;#39;s not in the way you think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friend introduced me to a girl that week who would eventually impact my life in some big ways. I won&amp;#39;t give a ton of story for this part though because it&amp;#39;s not super relevant except:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We started dating with exactly 30 days to go before I moved away, which at 15 and at the height of one&amp;#39;s pretention, seems very cinematic and tragic and lends the whole thing a very fated/Romeo and Juliet kind of thing, which wasn&amp;#39;t the kind of emotional shit I really needed to handle at that moment in time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;She was my first semi-sexual partner (I&amp;#39;ve never known how to classify this, she gave me oral and I fingered her but that was the extent of it. Not sure if that means I was a virgin after that or not.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;She broke up with me the day after Valentines Day after I&amp;#39;d moved because she&amp;#39;d already kissed some other boy. We&amp;#39;d of course written awful poetry to each other, spoken about marriage, decided we were soul mates, had plans for children, what our jobs would be, where we&amp;#39;d live, etc. by this point and that&amp;#39;s how our relationship ended, that time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We remained in this unhealthy non-friends, non-enemies, non-dating but on and off nonsense as periodically more than friends for a couple years, even while we both were relatively involved with other people. Unsurprisingly at this point, this is also important.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My move to Colorado was tough but ultimately I found many new friends (even if we were the weirdos who looked like Robert Smith and Morrissey), a new band, a new core group of people I still talk with to this day, and many girls, including the amazing one who&amp;#39;d become my wife. She was a friend of the girl I was dating at the time. She said something to someone about my girlfriend having a &amp;quot;vaginal wrench&amp;quot; on me, and that she&amp;#39;d vowed to have me by the end of the year. She had me within two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see, since I was very little, girls were an obsession for me. I never had that &amp;quot;girls are gross&amp;quot; stage, I pretty much always wanted to be around them and as I got older I pretty much always wanted to be inside them. And the two I slept with by the time I was 17 obliged frequently and sometimes acrobatically. I often wish for my own 18-year old virility back, but I digress. Let it be made clear here that the two girls I&amp;#39;d slept with (as in PIV sexytimes) includes the girl who&amp;#39;d become my wife. While the girl she&amp;#39;d &amp;quot;stolen&amp;quot; me from and I fought constantly and had real issues with jealousy and clinginess (mostly on my part), I found that this new girl (call her K) and I didn&amp;#39;t fight at all. We just didn&amp;#39;t, and really still don&amp;#39;t. We&amp;#39;d discuss any issues that came up an talk them through. Everything was great, we got along really, really well. Too well, in fact. Her mom had a hard time dealing with her divorce and was essentially a unipolar depressed person who did nothing but work at her job and watch TV. She wasn&amp;#39;t the most attentive woman around, which was gold for a 17-year old boy and his hot 16-year old girlfriend who wants nothing more than to fuck him. She had to convince me it was time to have sex, I was very cautious and didn&amp;#39;t want to jump into things, but of course we did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And being moronic teenagers who believe they are invincible, of course we got her pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finding out about this was no picnic, as you can imagine. We were trying to find a place to eat, it was our 1 year anniversary which also tends to fall on homecoming (long story) and at dinner, she kept running to the bathroom to throw up, which has been turned out to be a clear sign that my wife is pregnant ever since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d started art school by this point, but after much discussion and crying and explaining to our parents, we decided to have the baby. I went to school and worked a combined 15 hours a day some days, she worked at Target, and we lived together at her mothers house for about a year and a half. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I eventually got a good job in my field that paid me a salary, we moved out into our own apartment, and we got married about 18 months after our son was born. We waited to get married, which I think was a really smart decision, because we didn&amp;#39;t want to rush into a marriage and eventually feel obligated to each other in more ways than our son if a relationship between us didn&amp;#39;t work out. It was a good move, I think, even if it did confuse my son when he was old enough to do the math between our number of years married and his age. (&amp;quot;Wait, but I&amp;#39;m 13. That means you&amp;#39;ve been married 13 years, right?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Uh, no.&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had a young and growing family, we had ups and downs financially, I lost jobs and insurance, the economy tanked, I supported us on freelance and unemployment. While I worked for one particular shitty company, we had our second child when our oldest was three despite the fact that my employer never paid my insurance premiums, unbeknownst to us, and so our baby&amp;#39;s delivery and my wife&amp;#39;s pre-natal care were not covered. This led to terrible debt issues, which led to us paying rent late regularly. We needed co-signers for car loans, we had our phones shut off routinely, and through it all, we loved each other, supported each other and in general made a happy life out of a hard one by loving each other and our children. When our son was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 5, incurring a life-altering set of instructions for how to care for him to keep him alive, we didn&amp;#39;t have health insurance for his hospitalization and incurred a $38,000 hospital bill, and despite it all, we rolled with those punches, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having received her GED, my wife attended nursing aid school and went to work overnight at a hospital. Let me preface that I&amp;#39;m not blaming her being gone at night for what I&amp;#39;m going to tell you about what I did next,. but it explains how I had the time and what kind of environment I was in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see, about when she went to work at the hospital, our marriage had devolved a bit, as the above paragraph might lead you to expect:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Since we had been together since we were essentially children and hadn&amp;#39;t had much time to mature independently, we were emotionally enmeshed and incredibly co-dependent, as a therapist would later point out.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We just always had to deal with lots of money problems, which only got worse and worse and worse when my son went to the hospital.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We developed trust issues, I was snooping through her email and she mine, and at this time I became inappropriately close friends with an ex girlfriend. The one from before, from California. The one I&amp;#39;d had unhealthy and bone-headed obsessions with for years and years. That one.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We had two children under 5 who were incredibly spirited did not particularly get along&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We dealt with sleep deprivation, mood swings, depression, anxiety, passive aggressiveness, codependency.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On top of all of this, we spent 5 nights a week apart. We still had sex quite frequently, but our intimacy was threadbare.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty clearly here, I did some dumb shit. Like, really dumb shit. Shit that I would not be able to take if I had to live though it again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shit that in a fucked up way saved my marriage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See, I entered into an emotional affair with (surprise!) the previously mentioned ex girlfriend, the one from before my big move. The one I never got out of my life despite my friends hating her, despite my wife insisting this woman still had a thing for me, the woman I&amp;#39;d been convinced at one point I was going to marry had I not &amp;quot;been trapped by my wife and kids into this life&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This woman was getting married soon, and had her doubts about that. We discussed our relationships in intimate detail which led to the inevitable &amp;quot;we could treat each other so much better than our spouses are&amp;quot;. We didn&amp;#39;t care what our spouses would have thought about it, we were only in it for ourselves and had tons of ways to justify what we were doing. We started sending insane amounts of text messages, we employed secret email accounts, all-day IMing while we were at work, all- night phone calls while my wife was at work... It was bad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only way I can describe living with myself while behaving this way is: compartmentalization. I could alternatively turn on and off the self devoted to my wife and family and the self devoted to my affair. I could post all day about this and I bet it&amp;#39;s where most of my questions come from. Some points from above that played into this behavior besides a complete lack of love for myself, respect for my wife, and mental clarity:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I had a soft-spot in my heart for my hometown San Diego (still do) and she was a connection back to a time I saw as before my life fell apart. Before I&amp;#39;d been moved against my will, before I knocked someone up, before I would have needed to scrape snow off my car in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The affair took place exactly 10 years after our initial whirlwind Christmastime fling in high school and somehow that made it seem just as poetic or justified or meant to be or something equally self-serving and disgusting. It was easy to slip back into that ill-fated, star-cross&amp;#39;d lovers mindset and step outside of everyday life.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I had spent a lot of time missing that 16-year old I fell in love with and got pregnant while simultaneously resenting the 23-year old stressed out wife and mother she&amp;#39;d become. At my hands, admittedly, but that wasn&amp;#39;t important to me at the time. I told you it was fucked up.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I was not capable of communicating my needs to my wife because I didn&amp;#39;t feel she was capable of hearing them, so I told my ex instead and she told me about her unmet needs and we decided to be each other&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; secret. When some issue got heated between us (she wanted to get presents for my kids, and I wouldn&amp;#39;t let her, for instance), we&amp;#39;d cool it off by reminding ourselves that we were the &amp;quot;fun ones&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sequence of events for Christmas 2004 was:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Early Christmas morning - my wife leaves town to visit her sister on a pre-planned trip&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Christmas evening - I take my kids to Denny&amp;#39;s for dinner and get incredibly depressed and thoughtful about  what I was about to do, and what would happen to my life because of it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Day after Christmas - I take my kids to my parents&amp;#39; house and drive directly to the airport, where I pick up the woman I had up until this point been having an emotional affair with.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The next 24 hours - proceed to take this emotional affair into the physical realm.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Evening of December 27 - send my mistress home&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;New Year&amp;#39;s Eve - pick up my wife from her trip&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you need to understand is: my wife is truly amazing. It&amp;#39;s at this point in the story, where I really truly realized just how amazing. When she found out that the Christmas trip I&amp;#39;d sent her on to see her sister included my ex-girlfriend coming to town and spending 24 hours with me at a hotel downtown, she didn&amp;#39;t throw me out. She was beyond angry, to be sure, but she didn&amp;#39;t throw me out. She said she wasn&amp;#39;t done with me yet. She came close to being done with me many, many times, but she never did. This can be attributed to about 12 million things, but mostly:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Seriously, we really do love each other&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lots of therapy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lots of therapy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Appropriately-medicated mental health&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I worked my ass off to prove to her just how re-devoted I was to us. I wasn&amp;#39;t great at first but I got the hang of it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We worked on ourselves a lot over the next few years, and separated once for a total of 24 hours. She demanded I quit smoking to prove I had future plans with her and my children, and I did. Her mother moved in and helped manage the household while our marriage swept back and forth between stability and chaos. We cried a lot, we yelled a lot, we fucked a lot (we&amp;#39;ve always done that though). Once when things were back on a good track, I mentioned once how much I regretted doing what I&amp;#39;d done, and my wife said &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t, if you hadn&amp;#39;t had an affair, we wouldn&amp;#39;t have been forced to look at ourselves and fix things. Your affair saved our marriage.&amp;quot; And while I agree, I certainly can&amp;#39;t say it&amp;#39;s the best way to go about things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here we are.

I thought that program was something I wanted to go into but I ended up wanting nothing to do with it and now I still don't know what the hell I want to do with my life as far as a career goes and I'm so frustrated with myself because now I have this student loan to pay for a program that I got nothing out of.\n\nIt's a surprise really.  The program was full of many things, yet nothing sparked my interest as something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. (Honestly at first video editing sparking my interest but it didn't spark enough I guess)  I was in the Interactive Multimedia Developer Program. They teach you a range of things from several programming languages, like HTML, CSS, Javascript and so on, and it teaches you audio, video, photography, some graphic design, social media, web media, 3D, etc. The list goes on.\n\nIt amazes me. I learned so much in those 2 years and yet at the same time I feel like I didn't learn a thing.  I feel like I just got by.  I passed everything fairly well, getting mostly A's and B's on average, yet I hated it all and at this point, 5 months after officially graduating I don't even remember much of what I learned.  I'm honestly not sure how I even passed while I was there. I guess it's just that damn easy.\n\nRight now, I'm angry and frustrated. I want to find my passion but I feel like at this point, 2 years from being 30 if I haven't found it yet I may never find it. I went to school in Canada and recently moved back to the states where I will soon probably end up taking some crappy retail job because my college education failed me. I'm lost.\n\nAnother issue I have is that I have social anxiety and honestly when I got into my college program, the description of it never said anything about it being something that would be so huge on working with people. Clients. It's also huge on presentations which I never got over that fear either and failed on many of my presentations throughout the 2 years.\n\nHonestly the reason I got into the program at first was because I saw there was some video editing involved (I dabbled in it a little before) and I wanted to expand and there was no other program that offered it. I didn't want to become a person that openly communicated with new people every single day in order to do new projects and so on.  Hell I'm not even sure what I was thinking at all in the first place, but simply put, I'm scared of working with people and that is a hard thing to avoid, I know.\n\nI can get used to being at a job and working with the same people everyday, but working with new clients/customers almost everyday in person, my anxiety goes wild, but it seems to me that's all there is out there.\n\nWhat do you do when you have no passions, no talents and have social anxiety? I'm at a loss. I mean, I have some passions but not that will land me a career.  Especially when, like I said, I have no talents.  When all my classmates were excelling at programming or design, I couldn't ever find my place. I never found anything I was good at or even wanted to do.\n\nMaybe I'm just a sad human being who has no purpose and no use to society. I just don't know. But I do know that through those 2 years, while they were trying to teach everyone to be good at pitching ideas to clients and working with clients and meeting their demands, I just realized that I'm not the type of person that can pull that kind of thing off. I'm not a people person. At least, not face to face. I break down. I'm useless.\n\nSo here I am, sitting here, trying to think of a kind of career that would interest me that doesn't involve me working with people on such a large scale.

She was completely right and now seven years later I&amp;#39;m so confused on where to go next in my life.  I&amp;#39;m going to refer to this girl as H.  I spent a day at the school and met H almost immediately by coincidence, and we became casual friends once I started attending the school and told her about our mutual friends.  I had an incredibly hard time with girls in high school, but H and I were always acquaintances.  I guess I always had a small crush on her, but she was completely out of my league in my eyes.  She dated some random guy outside of school from the beginning of my sophomore year and was with him for a year.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(2007-2009)\nWhen I was a sophomore, a girl friend-zoned me beyond belief, but I was completely wrapped up with her anyway (we&amp;#39;ll call her R).  About midway through the year we stopped talking after she rejected me, but a few months passed and we became friends again.  We got even closer than before, but eventually she started dating another guy and we just continued like there was nothing different.  I got really depressed and started writing all these crappy emo songs on my guitar and I was just shitty.  This felt like it would never end, and by now I was halfway through my junior year of high school and I hadn&amp;#39;t even kissed a girl since seventh grade.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(February 2009)\nI played one of my songs live at an open mic night and that night H messaged me on Facebook to tell me how much she liked it.  It blew my mind, and because I was feeling so shitty, it really made me feel better.  H and I started talking daily and the conversations were literally perfect.  I didn&amp;#39;t feel nervous at all, just natural, but I knew I really liked her already and even her friends told me that she liked me when I was alone with them.  H would do things like write me letters about her day and then give them to me at the end, just out of boredom.  It was just clear and everything seemed perfect, except it was nearing the end of the school year.  H and R were both seniors at the time and I was still a junior, so both of them were getting ready for college.  Over the course of a month or so, all of my feelings that I had for R, were transferring to H.  We video chat every single night, went out together, everything.  I planned to ask H to junior/senior prom, but then I really started fucking myself over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(March 2009)\nIn all these good times, and being awkward me, I didn&amp;#39;t want to ruin anything and couldn&amp;#39;t figure out how or when to kiss H and it has just never happened.  Around spring break of that year, R broke up with her boyfriend, which was the same time things had really picked up with H.  I went on this Spring Break Habitat for Humanity trip that I didn&amp;#39;t even know R had signed up for, and so during that time I was texting H, but spending all day hanging out and flirting with R.  I was so confused about what I was doing, but it was a new feeling because two girls that I wanted were showing interest in me, while it was rare for even one to do so.  At the end of the trip, R and I got in a fight, which ended in us having an extreme make up conversation on the last night in which we both told each other how we wanted each other the entire time she was with her boyfriend.  She knew that I liked H, just because of the way we would act around each other and how well R already knew me.  The conversation just made us really close again, but nothing physical at all happened.  I kind of wanted to kiss her in the heat of the moment, but I knew in my head that I liked H more, and everything seemed like it would work out.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got back from talking with her and into my hotel room, my friends in the room saw how happy I was and suggested that I had just had sex with R (the fuck up of my life happens here).  I didn&amp;#39;t deny it.  I was just still smiling but not saying anything, I just felt too good.  It felt like we had completely reversed roles.  R wanted me now, finally, but I wanted H so much I was done wanting R.  So I get back home and before I know it, almost all of my friends are under the impression I had sex with R.  I didn&amp;#39;t know how to deal with this.  First off, more than anything, I don&amp;#39;t want H thinking that it did happen, so anytime R came up in our conversations, I just started acting like she was as annoying as everyone else saw her.  Second, I didn&amp;#39;t want R to find out and think I was lying about her.  I managed to keep it extremely quiet by telling everyone who asked that I was trying to make things work with H. Third, I didn&amp;#39;t want my friends to know it wasn&amp;#39;t true, because it had just escalated to a level I already thought was out of control and I was nervous about losing everything in my life that made me happy at the time.  Two days after school started back up, I asked H to prom by writing her a letter and folding it the way she always did.  H wrote me a letter back with a big checkmark and a yes and it seemed like everything had blown over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I continued to talk to R all the time, because I didn&amp;#39;t want to hurt her the way she had hurt me.  The day she found out I was going to prom with H, she video called me and we flirted for a few hours and she told me how she had planned to ask me to prom and just a lot of stuff that was making me feel like I fucked her over.  It wasn&amp;#39;t a fight at all, and eventually I got out of it to go video chat with H.  Everything was perfect still.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(April 2009 - Prom night)\nMeanwhile, the rumor about me and R is growing, but I&amp;#39;m just too blind to the fact to see it.  I plan to ask out H on prom night.  The dance was perfect.  Before we went into the after party, I asked her out.  Although her friends had told me how what I was doing was the right choice (even at the dance), it wasn&amp;#39;t.  H knew how I felt, but she was scared to get serious with me right before she had to leave for college which I had a gut feeling she would say the entire time.  It made the rest of the night awful.  We barely talked and just sat together until H said she wanted to go to bed.  I went upstairs and sat with her for a while.  We didn&amp;#39;t talk about earlier at all, and to make things worse, there was another girl (one of my best friends at the time) on the other side of the room crying on the phone with her ex.  I sat with H for about 15 minutes until I thought she fell asleep, and it was a moment I will never forget.  I got up to go. H woke up and told me I could stay, but I was terrified in a room of the house where boys were not even supposed to be, and awkwardly listening to this other girl on the phone and so I told H I&amp;#39;d see her in the morning.\nThings get out of hand at the party and while I&amp;#39;m already feeling like absolute shit, R shows up.  She skipped the actual dance, because she could not find a date.  She gets wasted and throws herself at me, but I&amp;#39;m too depressed to respond.  R continues drinking and throwing herself at all of my friends, knowing its pissing me off, but I already feel destroyed inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Summer 2009)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that I felt like I lost everything.  H and I continued talking, but it just sort of died out no matter how hard I tried to keep it alive.  Before long, it&amp;#39;s summer and I start hanging out with a different girl (M). H and I had always been friends with this one kind of crazy girl (D) who was literally a raging bitch and bully.  She got kicked out of our school along with another one of our friends after something she wrote on Facebook about a girl made it to the main office.  Everyone hated the girl she was writing about, and really liked D, because she was hilarious and crazy.  H had started becoming disillusioned with people in general even while we were talking.  One of her best friends had completely backstabbed her and in the process she lost a lot of friends.  She saw D as edgy and not afraid of being herself. They spent the entire summer before H went to college together, generally being complete bitches and subliminally talking about people through facebook statuses.  I spoke to H a few times over that summer, and she was completely different than the girl I knew a few months ago.  She was still great in my eyes, but I was starting to become disgusted with her actions.  D and I were close friends, but soon after she got kicked out, she turned her back on me and started talking shit about me with her new friends who also used to know me from public school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to M. We hang out alone all the time, and eventually my friends start catching on, but it was completely just being friends.  I started to like her, because she listened to me and liked just hanging out together instead of always with other people.  She is in my grade, and all my friends know her a lot better than H or R.    One night after dark, M and I are on the swings at a public park, when a spotlight comes on, and a police officer calls us over.  It just so happens that the officer was one of my good friends&amp;#39; fathers and he let us go and said we couldn&amp;#39;t be in the park past dusk.  I go over that friend&amp;#39;s house the next day to chill, and see his dad.  Obviously he calls me out on it in front of my friend.  I say that we were only talking and he give one of those &amp;quot;only TALKING? RIGHT...&amp;quot; kind of things and then my friend and his dad are both nudging me and insisting that M and I were hooking up.  My friend said that M and I hang out alone all the time, how people had seen us out together, and that I was spending less time with my other friends than normal.  I insist that we were only talking because I don&amp;#39;t want to deal with the R situation all over again, which I still am not denying, because I&amp;#39;m under the impression that it has passed.  M and I continue hanging out and eventually we&amp;#39;ve been out so much and seen so many people while we were together that people just start assuming that we are dating.  This had to have scared M, because things just faded out.  I would have liked to kiss her, and it hurt when she was gone, but it wasn&amp;#39;t anything like losing H.  In fact, the entire time things are playing out with M, H is in the back of my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(August 2009)\nWell, now my senior year is about to start and H and R are both at college.  The night before I start my senior year, H calls me crying on the phone.  She is upset about her roommates and homesick.  I manage to calm her down and she starts telling me about how she misses me and the way things were.  We start video chatting off and on again, and I really start to like her again.  Now we&amp;#39;re hundreds of miles away and I&amp;#39;m feeling everything I did for her a few months before.  This continues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(October 2009)\nI&amp;#39;m still talking with H all the time.  She&amp;#39;s definitely different and a lot more cynical and bitchy, but it doesn&amp;#39;t change the way I feel about her.  One night I&amp;#39;m hanging with my best friend.  His girlfriend also happens to be best friends with M and I would say at the time she was also one of my best friends.  He&amp;#39;s wrapped up in texting her and I can tell something is bothering him.  He eventually tells me that she had heard that I was telling people M and I were hooking up over the summer and that M is saying nothing happened.  It&amp;#39;s finally happening.  I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.  This is my best friend, and for the first time I realized that these had completely become my own lies at this point, so I did the only thing I could think of.  I just lied straight to his face.  He bought it and continued fighting with his girlfriend defending me.  She didn&amp;#39;t buy it on the other hand.  That month she tried to get me to stop smoking weed because I was her partner for Peer Leadership.  I told her I quit in the beginning of the school year, but needless to say, she catches me in my lie one day when she reads her boyfriend&amp;#39;s texts.  She uses this as ammo in her on going secret argument with my best friend.  I guess I had been a good enough friend to her, and the fact that she is the most righteous person I&amp;#39;ve ever met, so she let me just get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H messages me on facebook one night.  She is upset again and I start to talk to her but this time it&amp;#39;s a completely different reason.  She starts talking about a boy, and I find out that over the summer while we weren&amp;#39;t talking, she had been hooking up with one of D and my mutual friends.  This devastates me.  I told her I never wanted to talk to her about other guys again and just start pouring out this built up anger and hurt about how I miss her and I&amp;#39;m not over her at all.  She understood and wasn&amp;#39;t mad at me, but for the first time I opened up to her for real and my mind was on me instead of her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is killing me.  My birthday is coming up and I tell myself that I am going to just forget H all together.  The night of my birthday I end up alone with this unbelievably gorgeous girl, blacked out, and just listening to her talk.  She&amp;#39;s cuddling with me, and we end up spooning and falling asleep for an hour before everyone has to leave (her parents didn&amp;#39;t know boys were staying over and we left at 6 AM).  Her best friend wakes us up and right away it&amp;#39;s just hints that we were hooking up from everyone.  I&amp;#39;m still black out drunk and get in a car with five of my bros.  Right away everyone is asking me what happened.  I guess because I was feeling drunk, hurt, and invincible since I&amp;#39;d gotten away with so many lies already, I decided to give myself a birthday present.  I told all my friends that I had fucked her.  I didn&amp;#39;t care at all.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two nights later H video calls me.  She tells me how she is really sorry for upsetting me the other night.  We talk about it and everything is feeling better.  She asks me what I think of her and I was completely honest and told her how I thought she changed.  She tells me that I wasn&amp;#39;t the first person to notice and that she had started to notice herself.  I told her that I knew it was D&amp;#39;s fault, and she tells me that she sees that.  She starts crying, and I just keep telling her how I know she&amp;#39;s still perfect.  This is a key point in our &amp;quot;relationship,&amp;quot; (for lack of a better word) because she starts telling me how she misses the way things were and it&amp;#39;s almost as if that&amp;#39;s all she needed to feel the same way I&amp;#39;d been feeling.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, birthday girl stops talking to me all together and it&amp;#39;s just terribly awkward when we&amp;#39;re around each other which is all the time.  I know in the back of my head that she knows. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(November 2009)\nH comes home and drives straight to my house.  We sit outside and just talk for two hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(New Year&amp;#39;s Eve 2009)\nI go to a party for New Years and suddenly R shows up.  I&amp;#39;ve been nice to her for awhile, but we barely talk at this point, because she&amp;#39;s been at school being a whorert talking and it feels awesome to be back and laughing with her.  I&amp;#39;m kind of interested in hooking up with another girl at the party, so I plan to use that to make R want me. The ball drops and R&amp;#39;s drunk best friend jumps on me and hooks up with me then apologizes.  I laugh it off and then turn right to R and kiss her.  The entire night, R and I are alone together hooking up while everyone is partying.  We fool around for the entire night.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H texts me on the first, and makes a sarcastic comment about me hooking up with R and just keeps going with it.  I can tell it&amp;#39;s bothering her.  Eventually it&amp;#39;s really bothering me and I tell her that it&amp;#39;s completely unfair for her to judge me for hooking up with other girls if we weren&amp;#39;t together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(January 2010)\nR is the only girl on my mind after this.  A few days later she throws a party at her house, and when I get there she is already flirting with another guy and we barely talk.  I&amp;#39;m just unable to comprehend or deal with the fears and anxiety I&amp;#39;m having and call a friend nearby to come get me.  My best friend from earlier leaves with me.  I&amp;#39;m completely breaking down in front of them.  This has never happened to me.  I&amp;#39;m crying my eyes out in front of my friends who thought this girl was completely removed from my life until a few nights ago.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;R texts me the next day apologizing, but I&amp;#39;m almost positive she fucked the other guy that night, which is confirmed to me by the prom night cell phone girl. I kind of say whatever, but it&amp;#39;s definitely still bothering me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I go over another friend&amp;#39;s house a few nights later and it just so happens that he has been secretly fucking the girl who jumped on me on New Years.  She shows up with R, who comes over to me right away.  We end up cuddling and hooking up for a little.  After they leave she texts me and tells me to come over her house.  I head over and we are hooking up in her bed all night.  Her mom knows I&amp;#39;m there but thinks I&amp;#39;m in another room.  R doesn&amp;#39;t want to have sex because her parents are one room over.  We&amp;#39;d been hooking up for a few hours before her mom came in and told me to go back to the other room.  I didn&amp;#39;t, but now there was no chance I could convince R although I continued trying.  I left when the sun was coming up and felt amazing. We see each other a few more times and kiss and stuff and it feels great.  Then she has to go back to school.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(  - March 2010)\nWe keep talking on the phone and video chat everyday and it finally feels like a real relationship is spawning even though we are a thousand miles apart.  But it starts dying out fast.  R could never do a long distance relationship, because she is dependent on others opinions which leads to her sleeping around a lot. It hurts, but it&amp;#39;s really just kind of like when M left.  It didn&amp;#39;t bother me as much as I thought it would.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(March 2010 - )\nH is back to video chatting with me at least once a week.  I&amp;#39;m definitely falling for her all over again.  She&amp;#39;s stopped talking to D and is sincerely interested in me.  I find out she&amp;#39;ll be home in time for my prom.  In the meantime, H&amp;#39;s neighbor and good friend (A), just broke up with her boyfriend.  We both knew that we had had a small crush on each other right before they started dating.  She texts me all the time and I&amp;#39;m planning to ask her to prom, but I&amp;#39;m a day late when I find out she has a date.  Shit.  I ask one of my friends, but she said yes to another guy the period before I asked her.  One night while H and I are video chatting, I hold up a sign that says &amp;quot;Prom?&amp;quot; on it.  H tells me that she would feel weird being back at the prom, because it means being around a lot of people she doesn&amp;#39;t like and she always thought it was weird when people who had graduated were at proms.  I told her that I hadn&amp;#39;t thought of that, but she was the only girl I knew everything would feel completely right with.  Well, A tells H that I had asked the other girl first.  I didn&amp;#39;t know this and all of a sudden H isn&amp;#39;t responding to any of my calls or texts.  I ask her what&amp;#39;s the matter one day and after not getting a response, I call her and tell her I have no idea what&amp;#39;s bothering her.  She calls me back and is really distraught by the fact that I asked someone before I told her that.  I was telling her the truth though, and I was able to finally explain that I didn&amp;#39;t mean it the way she interpreted it.  Things are just different after this.  It&amp;#39;s like H had been convinced I couldn&amp;#39;t hurt her and then I did.  We stop talking for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(April 2010 - June 2010)\nMeanwhile I&amp;#39;m talking to A constantly, and really starting to like her.  I&amp;#39;m kind of mad at H in my mind, but she&amp;#39;s still constantly there.  What I didn&amp;#39;t know was that A was also talking to one of my best friends.  I&amp;#39;m about to graduate, so my friends and I are getting drunk and high all day in or out of school and generally I feel like I&amp;#39;m invincible.  Well, one night I get arrested for possession of marijuana, and I&amp;#39;d always been seen as the responsible one out of my group of friends.  EVERYONE finds out about it.  It&amp;#39;s traumatizing and destroys what is left of my self confidence.  I was really drunk at the time as well, but managed to avoid having that detected.  My parents start yelling at me right away.  My best friend (with the girlfriend who has figured me out)  is with me the whole time, but didn&amp;#39;t get arrested.  I make up a bullshit story and lie right to my parents in front of him.  I don&amp;#39;t know what else to do.  My ego points are in the negative and it seriously feels like it would be easier to just die for the first time in my life.  I called H that night and it was almost as though she knew I would call.  She was up and calmed me down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I graduate high school in the worst emotional state I&amp;#39;ve ever been in.  H comes to my graduation for me.  I don&amp;#39;t know how to take this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things with A turn into an ordeal because she is talking to me and my buddy.  I make another bad decision and confess this false love for her that I&amp;#39;d made up because of built up emotion and desperation.  She is receptive to everything I&amp;#39;m saying, but she knows that we found out she is talking to us both.  She even tells me how she had a dream of losing her virginity to me.  The problem is that A and I talked about sex, which meant I had to reopen all those old lies when she would ask about them.  She also is close friends with the birthday girl I lied about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H and I are talking on and off, but only on a friendly basis.  One day while I&amp;#39;m at college orientation, the girl from my birthday calls me.  I called her back and she said she couldn&amp;#39;t talk on the phone but to Facebook message her.  She tells me it&amp;#39;s not a big deal, but she&amp;#39;s heard that I&amp;#39;d been saying I had sex with her all year.  Literally, this is a nightmare coming true.  I let her know that I had lied earlier in the year, but stopped saying it and that I was completely sorry.  She asks me why I did it and I tell her that I was just really sexually attracted to her at the time and drunk in the morning and it just slipped out and got to be too much for me to control.  She says it&amp;#39;s fine and I should come smoke with her over the summer and she&amp;#39;s sad that it made things so awkward for so long.  I&amp;#39;m feeling terrible, but college is about to start and A is still talking to me.  Eventually though, A decides to get out of the situation altogether once she got both my friend and my hopes incredibly high and it started damaging our friendship.  In the long run I&amp;#39;m so thankful this happened though, because it made me and one of my best friends even closer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(August 2010 - )\nI finally get to college and join a fraternity, I&amp;#39;m meeting people and I&amp;#39;m starting to feel like I could seriously just forget about all these girls.  Then H wants to video chat again.  We vchat and she is cuter than ever.  Everything comes back to me almost instantly.  I&amp;#39;m kicking myself for days, because I&amp;#39;m spending all my time focusing on texting her. I see her again during break in November, but I also see R.  Everything is normal with her, but H is the only girl on my mind.  I feel nothing more for R than she is a friend.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I get back to school, I notice that R has unfriended me on facebook.  This creeps me out right away and I call her.  No answer.  I call her four times that day, but she doesn&amp;#39;t answer.  So I send her a text that says, &amp;quot;forget that I exist?&amp;quot;  She responds by saying, &amp;quot;No, I just don&amp;#39;t like some of the things I&amp;#39;ve heard you&amp;#39;ve been saying.&amp;quot;  No.  This isn&amp;#39;t happening.  Fuck, this is a lie that is years old now and she knows.  I guess one of my psychological defense mechanisms kicked in and started making me think that what I did was only equal to the pain she caused me.  I don&amp;#39;t respond, but I&amp;#39;m just terrified to go anywhere and see her while I&amp;#39;m home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see H as soon as I get back from college for winter break.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(New Years Eve 2010 - )\nI hang out with one of H&amp;#39;s best friends.  This is the same girl who told me that she liked me a few years ago, and she knows how much I like her.  I tell her that I&amp;#39;m still completely in love with H and she tells me not to give up on it, because she knows H still has feelings for me.  I spend the night just talking and smoking with this girl, feeling alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything is starting to feel completely gone.  I talk to H off and on again, but it isn&amp;#39;t enough.  All I can think about is how she is having a blast at school and I can&amp;#39;t even think about any other girls.  It&amp;#39;s not even like I don&amp;#39;t have the opportunities.  There are plenty of girls all around and plenty I could have confidently made a move on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Spring break 2011 - )\nI want to see H, but things just don&amp;#39;t work out and I&amp;#39;m stuck at home with my friends every night.  They are starting to get into popping pills and just harder drugs in general.  I&amp;#39;m not too big of a fan of either of those situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I get back to school, I check my mail and find a hand-written letter from H.  She tells me how she is sorry that the timing never worked out for us and how she thinks I&amp;#39;m a perfect boy.  She ends the letter by saying, &amp;quot;I love you very much.&amp;quot;  Nothing has ever felt better, but the pain of just not being able to be with her is really making me depressed.  I have never told her that I love her, but I think I was denying it until then.  That letter reassured me, and the feeling hasn&amp;#39;t left since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Summer 2011 - ) \nI get home from school and I start hanging out with my friends that night.  They surprise me with an eighth of mushrooms and tell me we are going to have a fun night.  I&amp;#39;ve never hallucinated, but decide to do it.  We take the mushrooms and everything feels great.  Somehow I remember during the come up that today was exactly a year from the day I got arrested.  My trip loses control.  I am completely detached from reality, seeing the seed of the universe and feeling responsible for destroying it.  My friends are terrified and since they are also tripping, they aren&amp;#39;t thinking and lock me in the basement with the lights off hoping I&amp;#39;d fall asleep. They tell me that throughout the night they hear me cracking up and then crying.  One of my best friends even tells me that I one point I was proclaiming to be the anti-christ.  I finally come back to reality a few hours later and feel the most overwhelming anxiety.  I felt as though my mind just got completely raped. I&amp;#39;m scared of the social kick back but also just scared of myself.  My friends are talking about it for days and are legitimately terrified of me, but no one is asking if things are ok or what not, they are just interested in the things I was seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This continues all summer.  I really miss H and talk to her a few times on facebook, but nothing further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Fall 2011)\nBack to school.  I decide to change the way I am, because I really feel like I was starting to go down that same path as my friends.  They are getting into even harder drugs and I&amp;#39;m not about that at all.  I&amp;#39;ve decided it&amp;#39;s about time to just get over her.  I&amp;#39;m not letting myself have the college experience that I&amp;#39;m supposed to be having.  I start wearing nice clthes and keeping better care of myself in general.  I start getting involved in a lot of school stuff in hopes of meeting people, but I&amp;#39;m subjecting myself to people I&amp;#39;m not really similar to.  I&amp;#39;m comparing every girl I talk to to H in my head and it just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to make any sort of pursuit because they don&amp;#39;t compare.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(New Years Eve 2011)\nI go to a party at a friends beach house.  The birthday girl is there and things are as awkward as usual.  She brings up my lie as a joke to me and I finally apologize to her face.  The fact that she joked about it, makes me think that everyone knows.  Everyone has someone to kiss except me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(2012)\nI start drunk calling H, and I always tell her how I miss her and just want to hear her talk.  I can&amp;#39;t bring myself to tell her I love her.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much how things work the entire year.  By Spring I&amp;#39;m starting to ween myself off of her, but it&amp;#39;s fake and I know it.  I stay at school most of the summer and don&amp;#39;t talk to H until maybe August.  Not many people are around campus and I&amp;#39;m just alone with my thoughts almost all summer.  I come home, see my friends, but not H.  My friends are out of control.  Half have already dropped out of school and the rest are just all about drugs. They all have girls though.  In my mind I know that they know about all of my lies.  I really start feeling awkward ever being in conversation with them.  It&amp;#39;s like I have nothing to say because my ego has just humbled itself.  I&amp;#39;ve also told myself I can&amp;#39;t keep living with these lies, and my friends have all stopped bring those girls up, but I know they know.  I want to spend as much time on my own making music as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Fall 2012)\nI go back to school and I&amp;#39;m feeling like the beginning of last year.  I&amp;#39;m going to stop being shitty and have a normal college experience.  I&amp;#39;m a junior, a virgin, and haven&amp;#39;t kissed a girl since R.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, H is retweeting or favoriting everything I say on twitter.  By November, she&amp;#39;s back in my head.  She&amp;#39;s texting me now, and that reversal feeling is back.  It&amp;#39;s like H wants me again, like she&amp;#39;s willing to take this chance.  She&amp;#39;s a senior, so I don&amp;#39;t know how to make things work.  I&amp;#39;m 700 miles away from her on the daily.  She&amp;#39;s going to graduate and move back home, and I&amp;#39;m behind in my schooling.  I don&amp;#39;t get to see her while I&amp;#39;m home for Thanksgiving, but while I&amp;#39;m home we are trying to make plans to hang out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day back at school, I post a video called The Power of Introverts on twitter.  H texts me right away and this leads to this really deep conversation about how our personalities are both introverted and she tells me about how its bothered her her entire life.  This is one of the deepest conversations I&amp;#39;ve ever had with her, and right away it just makes me float.  I love this girl so much.  We are texting all the time and talking on twitter.  She tweets hearts at me, I send her smiles, it feels almost completely like when things first picked up between us.  I decide that over winter break I&amp;#39;m going to take her out.  I ask her to go to a concert a few nights before New Years and she says yes!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get back home and overall I&amp;#39;m just tired of the way my friends are acting.  I hang out with them a few times, but they are used to hanging out every single day and pick up on.  They are mad and feel like I&amp;#39;m trying to avid them, which isn&amp;#39;t false, but it makes me feel like they are all gone for good.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to see H before the concert, but her schedule with work and her friends just doesn&amp;#39;t allow it.  I pick her up the night of the concert.  I haven&amp;#39;t physically seen her since November 2011, so I&amp;#39;m nervous, but it doesn&amp;#39;t make me feel any different.  I told myself that I would tell her I love her tonight.  I would kiss her tonight.  I did neither.  I was paralyzed with fear at every opportunity.  The time together was perfect and we talked just like the old days and it was perfect.  I had told her that the next day I might be leaving for New Years, but really I have no intentions of it.  I told all of my friends I would be so I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to deal with them.  I text her to tell her I didn&amp;#39;t leave two days later (she had work all of the next day).  It&amp;#39;s New Years Eve 2012.  I tell her I&amp;#39;m home and she says &amp;quot;yay!&amp;quot; I ask her to get dinner later between when she gets off work and when she leaves for her party.  She says yes and she asks what I&amp;#39;m doing for the night.  I tell her nothing, but she doesn&amp;#39;t respond.  I ask when she gets off work.  Nothing.  Seven hours later I text her to see if she was still up for the pizza and she tells me sorry but she&amp;#39;s getting ready.  I tell her I&amp;#39;m home a few more days, and to text me if she wants to hang out.  In my head I had gotten my hopes up that she would give me the opportunity to go to the party with her and kiss her.  I&amp;#39;ve never felt so alone.  I know she is only with one of her friends, but while they are having fun, I&amp;#39;m here typing this.  I&amp;#39;m terrified of her having a New Years kiss from anyone but me.  I don&amp;#39;t know where to go from here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m selfish.  I&amp;#39;ve lied.  I really have no self-confidence at all anymore, but I&amp;#39;m alright at faking it.  I seriously hate myself for putting myself in this position.  I don&amp;#39;t even know how much H knows about me lying or if she does at all.  We don&amp;#39;t talk about it at all, it&amp;#39;s just always about us.  I&amp;#39;m not suicidal, but I can&amp;#39;t help but feel that everyone around me would be happier if they never knew me.  I&amp;#39;ve been making a serious effort to be a better person for a year now and I am.  I don&amp;#39;t tell stupid little lies, I do nice things for people, and I&amp;#39;m seriously completely different.  I understand myself better than ever, and I feel like H feels that way too, but I don&amp;#39;t have a clue where to go from here.  Do I just forget it all and go try to find someone new at school?  Will I even be able to?  Do I tell H how I feel?  Does she know I love her already?  What if she doesn&amp;#39;t text me while I&amp;#39;m home?  She works all day today and then she&amp;#39;s free, but I just feel like I won&amp;#39;t see her again.  Why does she tell me she misses me and do all this cute shit and then make it so difficult to see her?  My heart is really hurting.  I&amp;#39;ve never let anyone ever know all of this.  I&amp;#39;m 21, still a virgin, and cripplingly in love with this girl.  I feel like I&amp;#39;m torturing myself.  I love school, but I&amp;#39;m seriously considering transferring next year to be closer to a girl that I&amp;#39;ve never even formally dated.  Like, I feel like a creep but it&amp;#39;s too real of a feeling to just let go of.  I feel like karma is going to fucking ruin my life no matter how hard I try to fight it.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","domain":"self.MMFB","author":"karmaiskillingme","user_reports":[],"link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"title":"The last third of my life has been a huge lie and no matter the fact that I've changed, I'm still trapped and lovesick","banned_by":null,"subreddit":"MMFB","author_flair_text":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"selftext":"Strap yourself in for the ride.\n\n(2006)\nSo, although I'm now 21, this all started when I was 14 in eighth grade when I got into a private high school.  One of my friends at the time told me about how awesome one of her friends who goes there is and showed me her myspace at the time.  She told me that I would fall in love with this girl before I'd ever even seen her in person.  She was completely right and now seven years later I'm so confused on where to go next in my life.  I'm going to refer to this girl as H.  I spent a day at the school and met H almost immediately by coincidence, and we became casual friends once I started attending the school and told her about our mutual friends.  I had an incredibly hard time with girls in high school, but H and I were always acquaintances.  I guess I always had a small crush on her, but she was completely out of my league in my eyes.  She dated some random guy outside of school from the beginning of my sophomore year and was with him for a year.  \n\n(2007-2009)\nWhen I was a sophomore, a girl friend-zoned me beyond belief, but I was completely wrapped up with her anyway (we'll call her R).  About midway through the year we stopped talking after she rejected me, but a few months passed and we became friends again.  We got even closer than before, but eventually she started dating another guy and we just continued like there was nothing different.  I got really depressed and started writing all these crappy emo songs on my guitar and I was just shitty.  This felt like it would never end, and by now I was halfway through my junior year of high school and I hadn't even kissed a girl since seventh grade.  \n\n(February 2009)\nI played one of my songs live at an open mic night and that night H messaged me on Facebook to tell me how much she liked it.  It blew my mind, and because I was feeling so shitty, it really made me feel better.  H and I started talking daily and the conversations were literally perfect.  I didn't feel nervous at all, just natural, but I knew I really liked her already and even her friends told me that she liked me when I was alone with them.  H would do things like write me letters about her day and then give them to me at the end, just out of boredom.  It was just clear and everything seemed perfect, except it was nearing the end of the school year.  H and R were both seniors at the time and I was still a junior, so both of them were getting ready for college.  Over the course of a month or so, all of my feelings that I had for R, were transferring to H.  We video chat every single night, went out together, everything.  I planned to ask H to junior/senior prom, but then I really started fucking myself over.\n\n(March 2009)\nIn all these good times, and being awkward me, I didn't want to ruin anything and couldn't figure out how or when to kiss H and it has just never happened.  Around spring break of that year, R broke up with her boyfriend, which was the same time things had really picked up with H.  I went on this Spring Break Habitat for Humanity trip that I didn't even know R had signed up for, and so during that time I was texting H, but spending all day hanging out and flirting with R.  I was so confused about what I was doing, but it was a new feeling because two girls that I wanted were showing interest in me, while it was rare for even one to do so.  At the end of the trip, R and I got in a fight, which ended in us having an extreme make up conversation on the last night in which we both told each other how we wanted each other the entire time she was with her boyfriend.  She knew that I liked H, just because of the way we would act around each other and how well R already knew me.  The conversation just made us really close again, but nothing physical at all happened.  I kind of wanted to kiss her in the heat of the moment, but I knew in my head that I liked H more, and everything seemed like it would work out.  \n\nWhen I got back from talking with her and into my hotel room, my friends in the room saw how happy I was and suggested that I had just had sex with R (the fuck up of my life happens here).  I didn't deny it.  I was just still smiling but not saying anything, I just felt too good.  It felt like we had completely reversed roles.  R wanted me now, finally, but I wanted H so much I was done wanting R.  So I get back home and before I know it, almost all of my friends are under the impression I had sex with R.  I didn't know how to deal with this.  First off, more than anything, I don't want H thinking that it did happen, so anytime R came up in our conversations, I just started acting like she was as annoying as everyone else saw her.  Second, I didn't want R to find out and think I was lying about her.  I managed to keep it extremely quiet by telling everyone who asked that I was trying to make things work with H. Third, I didn't want my friends to know it wasn't true, because it had just escalated to a level I already thought was out of control and I was nervous about losing everything in my life that made me happy at the time.  Two days after school started back up, I asked H to prom by writing her a letter and folding it the way she always did.  H wrote me a letter back with a big checkmark and a yes and it seemed like everything had blown over.\n\nI continued to talk to R all the time, because I didn't want to hurt her the way she had hurt me.  The day she found out I was going to prom with H, she video called me and we flirted for a few hours and she told me how she had planned to ask me to prom and just a lot of stuff that was making me feel like I fucked her over.  It wasn't a fight at all, and eventually I got out of it to go video chat with H.  Everything was perfect still.  \n\n(April 2009 - Prom night)\nMeanwhile, the rumor about me and R is growing, but I'm just too blind to the fact to see it.  I plan to ask out H on prom night.  The dance was perfect.  Before we went into the after party, I asked her out.  Although her friends had told me how what I was doing was the right choice (even at the dance), it wasn't.  H knew how I felt, but she was scared to get serious with me right before she had to leave for college which I had a gut feeling she would say the entire time.  It made the rest of the night awful.  We barely talked and just sat together until H said she wanted to go to bed.  I went upstairs and sat with her for a while.  We didn't talk about earlier at all, and to make things worse, there was another girl (one of my best friends at the time) on the other side of the room crying on the phone with her ex.  I sat with H for about 15 minutes until I thought she fell asleep, and it was a moment I will never forget.  I got up to go. H woke up and told me I could stay, but I was terrified in a room of the house where boys were not even supposed to be, and awkwardly listening to this other girl on the phone and so I told H I'd see her in the morning.\nThings get out of hand at the party and while I'm already feeling like absolute shit, R shows up.  She skipped the actual dance, because she could not find a date.  She gets wasted and throws herself at me, but I'm too depressed to respond.  R continues drinking and throwing herself at all of my friends, knowing its pissing me off, but I already feel destroyed inside.\n\n(Summer 2009)\n\nAfter that I felt like I lost everything.  H and I continued talking, but it just sort of died out no matter how hard I tried to keep it alive.  Before long, it's summer and I start hanging out with a different girl (M). H and I had always been friends with this one kind of crazy girl (D) who was literally a raging bitch and bully.  She got kicked out of our school along with another one of our friends after something she wrote on Facebook about a girl made it to the main office.  Everyone hated the girl she was writing about, and really liked D, because she was hilarious and crazy.  H had started becoming disillusioned with people in general even while we were talking.  One of her best friends had completely backstabbed her and in the process she lost a lot of friends.  She saw D as edgy and not afraid of being herself. They spent the entire summer before H went to college together, generally being complete bitches and subliminally talking about people through facebook statuses.  I spoke to H a few times over that summer, and she was completely different than the girl I knew a few months ago.  She was still great in my eyes, but I was starting to become disgusted with her actions.  D and I were close friends, but soon after she got kicked out, she turned her back on me and started talking shit about me with her new friends who also used to know me from public school.\n\nBack to M. We hang out alone all the time, and eventually my friends start catching on, but it was completely just being friends.  I started to like her, because she listened to me and liked just hanging out together instead of always with other people.  She is in my grade, and all my friends know her a lot better than H or R.    One night after dark, M and I are on the swings at a public park, when a spotlight comes on, and a police officer calls us over.  It just so happens that the officer was one of my good friends' fathers and he let us go and said we couldn't be in the park past dusk.  I go over that friend's house the next day to chill, and see his dad.  Obviously he calls me out on it in front of my friend.  I say that we were only talking and he give one of those \"only TALKING? RIGHT...\" kind of things and then my friend and his dad are both nudging me and insisting that M and I were hooking up.  My friend said that M and I hang out alone all the time, how people had seen us out together, and that I was spending less time with my other friends than normal.  I insist that we were only talking because I don't want to deal with the R situation all over again, which I still am not denying, because I'm under the impression that it has passed.  M and I continue hanging out and eventually we've been out so much and seen so many people while we were together that people just start assuming that we are dating.  This had to have scared M, because things just faded out.  I would have liked to kiss her, and it hurt when she was gone, but it wasn't anything like losing H.  In fact, the entire time things are playing out with M, H is in the back of my head.\n\n(August 2009)\nWell, now my senior year is about to start and H and R are both at college.  The night before I start my senior year, H calls me crying on the phone.  She is upset about her roommates and homesick.  I manage to calm her down and she starts telling me about how she misses me and the way things were.  We start video chatting off and on again, and I really start to like her again.  Now we're hundreds of miles away and I'm feeling everything I did for her a few months before.  This continues.\n\n(October 2009)\nI'm still talking with H all the time.  She's definitely different and a lot more cynical and bitchy, but it doesn't change the way I feel about her.  One night I'm hanging with my best friend.  His girlfriend also happens to be best friends with M and I would say at the time she was also one of my best friends.  He's wrapped up in texting her and I can tell something is bothering him.  He eventually tells me that she had heard that I was telling people M and I were hooking up over the summer and that M is saying nothing happened.  It's finally happening.  I don't know what to do.  This is my best friend, and for the first time I realized that these had completely become my own lies at this point, so I did the only thing I could think of.  I just lied straight to his face.  He bought it and continued fighting with his girlfriend defending me.  She didn't buy it on the other hand.  That month she tried to get me to stop smoking weed because I was her partner for Peer Leadership.  I told her I quit in the beginning of the school year, but needless to say, she catches me in my lie one day when she reads her boyfriend's texts.  She uses this as ammo in her on going secret argument with my best friend.  I guess I had been a good enough friend to her, and the fact that she is the most righteous person I've ever met, so she let me just get away with it.\n\nH messages me on facebook one night.  She is upset again and I start to talk to her but this time it's a completely different reason.  She starts talking about a boy, and I find out that over the summer while we weren't talking, she had been hooking up with one of D and my mutual friends.  This devastates me.  I told her I never wanted to talk to her about other guys again and just start pouring out this built up anger and hurt about how I miss her and I'm not over her at all.  She understood and wasn't mad at me, but for the first time I opened up to her for real and my mind was on me instead of her.\n\nThis is killing me.  My birthday is coming up and I tell myself that I am going to just forget H all together.  The night of my birthday I end up alone with this unbelievably gorgeous girl, blacked out, and just listening to her talk.  She's cuddling with me, and we end up spooning and falling asleep for an hour before everyone has to leave (her parents didn't know boys were staying over and we left at 6 AM).  Her best friend wakes us up and right away it's just hints that we were hooking up from everyone.  I'm still black out drunk and get in a car with five of my bros.  Right away everyone is asking me what happened.  I guess because I was feeling drunk, hurt, and invincible since I'd gotten away with so many lies already, I decided to give myself a birthday present.  I told all my friends that I had fucked her.  I didn't care at all.  \n\nTwo nights later H video calls me.  She tells me how she is really sorry for upsetting me the other night.  We talk about it and everything is feeling better.  She asks me what I think of her and I was completely honest and told her how I thought she changed.  She tells me that I wasn't the first person to notice and that she had started to notice herself.  I told her that I knew it was D's fault, and she tells me that she sees that.  She starts crying, and I just keep telling her how I know she's still perfect.  This is a key point in our \"relationship,\" (for lack of a better word) because she starts telling me how she misses the way things were and it's almost as if that's all she needed to feel the same way I'd been feeling.  \n\nMeanwhile, birthday girl stops talking to me all together and it's just terribly awkward when we're around each other which is all the time.  I know in the back of my head that she knows. \n\n(November 2009)\nH comes home and drives straight to my house.  We sit outside and just talk for two hours.\n\n(New Year's Eve 2009)\nI go to a party for New Years and suddenly R shows up.  I've been nice to her for awhile, but we barely talk at this point, because she's been at school being a whorert talking and it feels awesome to be back and laughing with her.  I'm kind of interested in hooking up with another girl at the party, so I plan to use that to make R want me. The ball drops and R's drunk best friend jumps on me and hooks up with me then apologizes.  I laugh it off and then turn right to R and kiss her.  The entire night, R and I are alone together hooking up while everyone is partying.  We fool around for the entire night.  \n\nH texts me on the first, and makes a sarcastic comment about me hooking up with R and just keeps going with it.  I can tell it's bothering her.  Eventually it's really bothering me and I tell her that it's completely unfair for her to judge me for hooking up with other girls if we weren't together.\n\n(January 2010)\nR is the only girl on my mind after this.  A few days later she throws a party at her house, and when I get there she is already flirting with another guy and we barely talk.  I'm just unable to comprehend or deal with the fears and anxiety I'm having and call a friend nearby to come get me.  My best friend from earlier leaves with me.  I'm completely breaking down in front of them.  This has never happened to me.  I'm crying my eyes out in front of my friends who thought this girl was completely removed from my life until a few nights ago.  \n\nR texts me the next day apologizing, but I'm almost positive she fucked the other guy that night, which is confirmed to me by the prom night cell phone girl. I kind of say whatever, but it's definitely still bothering me. \n\nI go over another friend's house a few nights later and it just so happens that he has been secretly fucking the girl who jumped on me on New Years.  She shows up with R, who comes over to me right away.  We end up cuddling and hooking up for a little.  After they leave she texts me and tells me to come over her house.  I head over and we are hooking up in her bed all night.  Her mom knows I'm there but thinks I'm in another room.  R doesn't want to have sex because her parents are one room over.  We'd been hooking up for a few hours before her mom came in and told me to go back to the other room.  I didn't, but now there was no chance I could convince R although I continued trying.  I left when the sun was coming up and felt amazing. We see each other a few more times and kiss and stuff and it feels great.  Then she has to go back to school.  \n\n(  - March 2010)\nWe keep talking on the phone and video chat everyday and it finally feels like a real relationship is spawning even though we are a thousand miles apart.  But it starts dying out fast.  R could never do a long distance relationship, because she is dependent on others opinions which leads to her sleeping around a lot. It hurts, but it's really just kind of like when M left.  It didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.  \n\n(March 2010 - )\nH is back to video chatting with me at least once a week.  I'm definitely falling for her all over again.  She's stopped talking to D and is sincerely interested in me.  I find out she'll be home in time for my prom.  In the meantime, H's neighbor and good friend (A), just broke up with her boyfriend.  We both knew that we had had a small crush on each other right before they started dating.  She texts me all the time and I'm planning to ask her to prom, but I'm a day late when I find out she has a date.  Shit.  I ask one of my friends, but she said yes to another guy the period before I asked her.  One night while H and I are video chatting, I hold up a sign that says \"Prom?\" on it.  H tells me that she would feel weird being back at the prom, because it means being around a lot of people she doesn't like and she always thought it was weird when people who had graduated were at proms.  I told her that I hadn't thought of that, but she was the only girl I knew everything would feel completely right with.  Well, A tells H that I had asked the other girl first.  I didn't know this and all of a sudden H isn't responding to any of my calls or texts.  I ask her what's the matter one day and after not getting a response, I call her and tell her I have no idea what's bothering her.  She calls me back and is really distraught by the fact that I asked someone before I told her that.  I was telling her the truth though, and I was able to finally explain that I didn't mean it the way she interpreted it.  Things are just different after this.  It's like H had been convinced I couldn't hurt her and then I did.  We stop talking for a while.\n\n(April 2010 - June 2010)\nMeanwhile I'm talking to A constantly, and really starting to like her.  I'm kind of mad at H in my mind, but she's still constantly there.  What I didn't know was that A was also talking to one of my best friends.  I'm about to graduate, so my friends and I are getting drunk and high all day in or out of school and generally I feel like I'm invincible.  Well, one night I get arrested for possession of marijuana, and I'd always been seen as the responsible one out of my group of friends.  EVERYONE finds out about it.  It's traumatizing and destroys what is left of my self confidence.  I was really drunk at the time as well, but managed to avoid having that detected.  My parents start yelling at me right away.  My best friend (with the girlfriend who has figured me out)  is with me the whole time, but didn't get arrested.  I make up a bullshit story and lie right to my parents in front of him.  I don't know what else to do.  My ego points are in the negative and it seriously feels like it would be easier to just die for the first time in my life.  I called H that night and it was almost as though she knew I would call.  She was up and calmed me down.\n\nI graduate high school in the worst emotional state I've ever been in.  H comes to my graduation for me.  I don't know how to take this.\n\nThings with A turn into an ordeal because she is talking to me and my buddy.  I make another bad decision and confess this false love for her that I'd made up because of built up emotion and desperation.  She is receptive to everything I'm saying, but she knows that we found out she is talking to us both.  She even tells me how she had a dream of losing her virginity to me.  The problem is that A and I talked about sex, which meant I had to reopen all those old lies when she would ask about them.  She also is close friends with the birthday girl I lied about.\n\nH and I are talking on and off, but only on a friendly basis.  One day while I'm at college orientation, the girl from my birthday calls me.  I called her back and she said she couldn't talk on the phone but to Facebook message her.  She tells me it's not a big deal, but she's heard that I'd been saying I had sex with her all year.  Literally, this is a nightmare coming true.  I let her know that I had lied earlier in the year, but stopped saying it and that I was completely sorry.  She asks me why I did it and I tell her that I was just really sexually attracted to her at the time and drunk in the morning and it just slipped out and got to be too much for me to control.  She says it's fine and I should come smoke with her over the summer and she's sad that it made things so awkward for so long.  I'm feeling terrible, but college is about to start and A is still talking to me.  Eventually though, A decides to get out of the situation altogether once she got both my friend and my hopes incredibly high and it started damaging our friendship.  In the long run I'm so thankful this happened though, because it made me and one of my best friends even closer.\n\n(August 2010 - )\nI finally get to college and join a fraternity, I'm meeting people and I'm starting to feel like I could seriously just forget about all these girls.  Then H wants to video chat again.  We vchat and she is cuter than ever.  Everything comes back to me almost instantly.  I'm kicking myself for days, because I'm spending all my time focusing on texting her. I see her again during break in November, but I also see R.  Everything is normal with her, but H is the only girl on my mind.  I feel nothing more for R than she is a friend.  \n\nWhen I get back to school, I notice that R has unfriended me on facebook.  This creeps me out right away and I call her.  No answer.  I call her four times that day, but she doesn't answer.  So I send her a text that says, \"forget that I exist?\"  She responds by saying, \"No, I just don't like some of the things I've heard you've been saying.\"  No.  This isn't happening.  Fuck, this is a lie that is years old now and she knows.  I guess one of my psychological defense mechanisms kicked in and started making me think that what I did was only equal to the pain she caused me.  I don't respond, but I'm just terrified to go anywhere and see her while I'm home.\n\nI see H as soon as I get back from college for winter break.\n\n(New Years Eve 2010 - )\nI hang out with one of H's best friends.  This is the same girl who told me that she liked me a few years ago, and she knows how much I like her.  I tell her that I'm still completely in love with H and she tells me not to give up on it, because she knows H still has feelings for me.  I spend the night just talking and smoking with this girl, feeling alone.\n\nEverything is starting to feel completely gone.  I talk to H off and on again, but it isn't enough.  All I can think about is how she is having a blast at school and I can't even think about any other girls.  It's not even like I don't have the opportunities.  There are plenty of girls all around and plenty I could have confidently made a move on.\n\n(Spring break 2011 - )\nI want to see H, but things just don't work out and I'm stuck at home with my friends every night.  They are starting to get into popping pills and just harder drugs in general.  I'm not too big of a fan of either of those situations.\n\nWhen I get back to school, I check my mail and find a hand-written letter from H.  She tells me how she is sorry that the timing never worked out for us and how she thinks I'm a perfect boy.  She ends the letter by saying, \"I love you very much.\"  Nothing has ever felt better, but the pain of just not being able to be with her is really making me depressed.  I have never told her that I love her, but I think I was denying it until then.  That letter reassured me, and the feeling hasn't left since.\n\n(Summer 2011 - ) \nI get home from school and I start hanging out with my friends that night.  They surprise me with an eighth of mushrooms and tell me we are going to have a fun night.  I've never hallucinated, but decide to do it.  We take the mushrooms and everything feels great.  Somehow I remember during the come up that today was exactly a year from the day I got arrested.  My trip loses control.  I am completely detached from reality, seeing the seed of the universe and feeling responsible for destroying it.  My friends are terrified and since they are also tripping, they aren't thinking and lock me in the basement with the lights off hoping I'd fall asleep. They tell me that throughout the night they hear me cracking up and then crying.  One of my best friends even tells me that I one point I was proclaiming to be the anti-christ.  I finally come back to reality a few hours later and feel the most overwhelming anxiety.  I felt as though my mind just got completely raped. I'm scared of the social kick back but also just scared of myself.  My friends are talking about it for days and are legitimately terrified of me, but no one is asking if things are ok or what not, they are just interested in the things I was seeing.\n\nThis continues all summer.  I really miss H and talk to her a few times on facebook, but nothing further.\n\n(Fall 2011)\nBack to school.  I decide to change the way I am, because I really feel like I was starting to go down that same path as my friends.  They are getting into even harder drugs and I'm not about that at all.  I've decided it's about time to just get over her.  I'm not letting myself have the college experience that I'm supposed to be having.  I start wearing nice clthes and keeping better care of myself in general.  I start getting involved in a lot of school stuff in hopes of meeting people, but I'm subjecting myself to people I'm not really similar to.  I'm comparing every girl I talk to to H in my head and it just doesn't make sense to make any sort of pursuit because they don't compare.  \n\n(New Years Eve 2011)\nI go to a party at a friends beach house.  The birthday girl is there and things are as awkward as usual.  She brings up my lie as a joke to me and I finally apologize to her face.  The fact that she joked about it, makes me think that everyone knows.  Everyone has someone to kiss except me.  \n\n(2012)\nI start drunk calling H, and I always tell her how I miss her and just want to hear her talk.  I can't bring myself to tell her I love her.  \n\nThis is pretty much how things work the entire year.  By Spring I'm starting to ween myself off of her, but it's fake and I know it.  I stay at school most of the summer and don't talk to H until maybe August.  Not many people are around campus and I'm just alone with my thoughts almost all summer.  I come home, see my friends, but not H.  My friends are out of control.  Half have already dropped out of school and the rest are just all about drugs. They all have girls though.  In my mind I know that they know about all of my lies.  I really start feeling awkward ever being in conversation with them.  It's like I have nothing to say because my ego has just humbled itself.  I've also told myself I can't keep living with these lies, and my friends have all stopped bring those girls up, but I know they know.  I want to spend as much time on my own making music as possible.\n\n(Fall 2012)\nI go back to school and I'm feeling like the beginning of last year.  I'm going to stop being shitty and have a normal college experience.  I'm a junior, a virgin, and haven't kissed a girl since R.  \n\nMeanwhile, H is retweeting or favoriting everything I say on twitter.  By November, she's back in my head.  She's texting me now, and that reversal feeling is back.  It's like H wants me again, like she's willing to take this chance.  She's a senior, so I don't know how to make things work.  I'm 700 miles away from her on the daily.  She's going to graduate and move back home, and I'm behind in my schooling.  I don't get to see her while I'm home for Thanksgiving, but while I'm home we are trying to make plans to hang out.\n\nOne day back at school, I post a video called The Power of Introverts on twitter.  H texts me right away and this leads to this really deep conversation about how our personalities are both introverted and she tells me about how its bothered her her entire life.  This is one of the deepest conversations I've ever had with her, and right away it just makes me float.  I love this girl so much.  We are texting all the time and talking on twitter.  She tweets hearts at me, I send her smiles, it feels almost completely like when things first picked up between us.  I decide that over winter break I'm going to take her out.  I ask her to go to a concert a few nights before New Years and she says yes!  \n\nI get back home and overall I'm just tired of the way my friends are acting.  I hang out with them a few times, but they are used to hanging out every single day and pick up on.  They are mad and feel like I'm trying to avid them, which isn't false, but it makes me feel like they are all gone for good.  \n\nI want to see H before the concert, but her schedule with work and her friends just doesn't allow it.  I pick her up the night of the concert.  I haven't physically seen her since November 2011, so I'm nervous, but it doesn't make me feel any different.  I told myself that I would tell her I love her tonight.  I would kiss her tonight.  I did neither.  I was paralyzed with fear at every opportunity.  The time together was perfect and we talked just like the old days and it was perfect.  I had told her that the next day I might be leaving for New Years, but really I have no intentions of it.  I told all of my friends I would be so I wouldn't have to deal with them.  I text her to tell her I didn't leave two days later (she had work all of the next day).  It's New Years Eve 2012.  I tell her I'm home and she says \"yay!\" I ask her to get dinner later between when she gets off work and when she leaves for her party.  She says yes and she asks what I'm doing for the night.  I tell her nothing, but she doesn't respond.  I ask when she gets off work.  Nothing.  Seven hours later I text her to see if she was still up for the pizza and she tells me sorry but she's getting ready.  I tell her I'm home a few more days, and to text me if she wants to hang out.  In my head I had gotten my hopes up that she would give me the opportunity to go to the party with her and kiss her.  I've never felt so alone.  I know she is only with one of her friends, but while they are having fun, I'm here typing this.  I'm terrified of her having a New Years kiss from anyone but me.  I don't know where to go from here.\n\nI'm selfish.  I've lied.  I really have no self-confidence at all anymore, but I'm alright at faking it.  I seriously hate myself for putting myself in this position.  I don't even know how much H knows about me lying or if she does at all.  We don't talk about it at all, it's just always about us.  I'm not suicidal, but I can't help but feel that everyone around me would be happier if they never knew me.  I've been making a serious effort to be a better person for a year now and I am.  I don't tell stupid little lies, I do nice things for people, and I'm seriously completely different.  I understand myself better than ever, and I feel like H feels that way too, but I don't have a clue where to go from here.  Do I just forget it all and go try to find someone new at school?  Will I even be able to?  Do I tell H how I feel?  Does she know I love her already?  What if she doesn't text me while I'm home?  She works all day today and then she's free, but I just feel like I won't see her again.  Why does she tell me she misses me and do all this cute shit and then make it so difficult to see her?  My heart is really hurting.  I've never let anyone ever know all of this.  I'm 21, still a virgin, and cripplingly in love with this girl.  I feel like I'm torturing myself.  I love school, but I'm seriously considering transferring next year to be closer to a girl that I've never even formally dated.  Like, I feel like a creep but it's too real of a feeling to just let go of.  I feel like karma is going to fucking ruin my life no matter how hard I try to fight it.   \n\n\n\n\n","author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"created_utc":1357066824,"subreddit_id":"t5_2sjdn","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/15s4fm/the_last_third_of_my_life_has_been_a_huge_lie_and/","retrieved_on":1413240721}

We even fought a couple of times over the subject. He always said that he feels insecure because he has trouble lasting (true, but I enjoy the sex and have never put pressure on him), that his sex drive simply does not match mine, and maybe some other excuses, but those are ones that stick out to me.  \nAbout six months ago, I found out he watches porn OFTEN. This surprised me, as he stated before that watching porn was an act he did not want to take part in (a lie, obviously). Point is: he said he did not watch porn. So I was shocked when I found out. I did feel a bit jealous which is a normal feeling to have, I think, but I didn't freak out. I just asked him to be truthful if he was going to watch porn. But the more I thought about it, the more I concluded that porn had been replacing our sex life. I asked him if this was the case and he denied it at first, but admitted it soon enough. So after a year of stressing about lack of sex, I had the answer. I was pissed off. He told me the problem was other things. And then I felt inadequate and jealous and like a year was wasted worrying about why sex wasn't frequent enough and he was telling me lies.\nPorn was certainly the answer to our problem. He said it's not that he does not find me sexy (which I believe: it's obvious he thinks I'm sexy and attractive), and that I perfectly please his sexual desires, but that porn was just too easy. So his problem was lack of effort... Ugh.\n\nI then made a suggestion that he didn't like: If he watches porn, I want an outlet too. Men tend to like visuals. I like a man to tell me what they want. I suggested if he watches porn, I will go onto a sexual online chat. I will PM a man and we'll talk sexually until I get off or am satisfied or simply don't feel like chatting anymore. It goes no further than that. He will not know my name, I will exchange no pictures or videos of myself. We'll just talk. He'll tell me what he wants to do to me and I'll tell him how I'll please him, etc. All virtual fantasy. \nHe said he was not okay with this. I told him I'm not okay with him watching porn, especially since it affected out sex life for an entire year. So he stopped watching porn and we got our sex life back! Really... It was that easy. Sex is great and frequent again.\n\n*But* a week ago, I found out he had been watching porn. I asked him if he had and he lied to me. So I got on an online chat and PMd a guy and said \"I will not send you pictures or videos of myself. This will strictly be a chat.\" The man agreed to it, but I didn't reply any further. I got distracted with something else and exited the window. I did not engage in any sexual activity with any men online. I was just testing the waters, seeing how it would work for me.\n\nI told my boyfriend about it. He freaked out a little bit. He apologized for watching porn and lying about it. I told him I could get over him watching porn if it did not affect our sex life ever again in such a way it did before. He said he does not want to watch it. I told him \"Great, that's best to me, but please don't lie to me about it.\" If he doesn't watch porn, I won't pursue my own outlet.\n\nHe disagrees that watching porn and chatting online sexually is the same thing. Obviously, it's not the same thing.

Everything was 3 sets of 8 or 10, depending on what I had in me that day.\n\nSo I asked a guy at the gym for advice who is always friendly.  And ridiculously ripped.\n\nHe tells me that flys are finishing exercises and that he would suggest I do flat bench, incline and decline presses until I can press my body weight plus 50lbs. for one full set.  Then I could move on to finishing exercises and see good results.  Seems to make sense but... ???\n\nHe also told me my running from muscle group to muscle group was likely detrimental, or at the very least, hindering better progress.  That I should do all of my chest exercises and then all of my arm exercises.  Or whatever group I'm working on, do all of those exercises together.  His logic was that it concentrates the blood flow.  Again, seems to make sense, but... ???\n\nFinally, he suggested that when I start an exercise, to start out with lower weight, move up the next set, and then move up on the last set the my \"max\" weight.  Max weight being whatever I was lifting for the full 3 sets initially.\n\nAny advice on this?  \n\nAlso, as it stands, I do chest and arms twice a week, then shoulders and back twice a week.  I had been alternating each for a fifth workout each week, but I'm starting to read and hear that 5 days of lifting might actually be counter productive.  Is this generally true, true or false from person to person or total bullshit?\n\nNow, obviously I see and feel results from the time I've spent lifting - but I wonder if backing down to 4 days a week and sticking with a lift schedule as he suggested might benefit me?  \n\nAnother element is that I'm starting deadlifts.  Should I spend maybe that 5th day on deadlifts or should I incorporate them into another day?\n\nI don't know, I just feel like I'm all over the place.  I was enjoying some good results but my bench feels like it's not progressing and honestly I feel quite weak after giving it some thought.  I'm able to do 3 full sets of 10 at 145lbs., but I honestly don't feel like I could do 165lbs. for a full set.  I don't have a spotter and I'm a little gun shy after having done the roll of shame my first week in the gym.  I'm 5'11\" and weight 185.\n\nAny help or advice would be appreciated.

Everything was 3 sets of 8 or 10, depending on what I had in me that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I asked a guy at the gym for advice who is always friendly.  And ridiculously ripped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He tells me that flys are finishing exercises and that he would suggest I do flat bench, incline and decline presses until I can press my body weight plus 50lbs. for one full set.  Then I could move on to finishing exercises and see good results.  Seems to make sense but... ???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He also told me my running from muscle group to muscle group was likely detrimental, or at the very least, hindering better progress.  That I should do all of my chest exercises and then all of my arm exercises.  Or whatever group I&amp;#39;m working on, do all of those exercises together.  His logic was that it concentrates the blood flow.  Again, seems to make sense, but... ???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, he suggested that when I start an exercise, to start out with lower weight, move up the next set, and then move up on the last set the my &amp;quot;max&amp;quot; weight.  Max weight being whatever I was lifting for the full 3 sets initially.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice on this?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, as it stands, I do chest and arms twice a week, then shoulders and back twice a week.  I had been alternating each for a fifth workout each week, but I&amp;#39;m starting to read and hear that 5 days of lifting might actually be counter productive.  Is this generally true, true or false from person to person or total bullshit?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, obviously I see and feel results from the time I&amp;#39;ve spent lifting - but I wonder if backing down to 4 days a week and sticking with a lift schedule as he suggested might benefit me?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another element is that I&amp;#39;m starting deadlifts.  Should I spend maybe that 5th day on deadlifts or should I incorporate them into another day?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know, I just feel like I&amp;#39;m all over the place.  I was enjoying some good results but my bench feels like it&amp;#39;s not progressing and honestly I feel quite weak after giving it some thought.  I&amp;#39;m able to do 3 full sets of 10 at 145lbs., but I honestly don&amp;#39;t feel like I could do 165lbs. for a full set.  I don&amp;#39;t have a spotter and I&amp;#39;m a little gun shy after having done the roll of shame my first week in the gym.  I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;11&amp;quot; and weight 185.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any help or advice would be appreciated.
