I prefer playing in a medieval or victorian setting but I am open to a lot of ideas.\nNow I am here to find an rp partner. I write about 1 to 4 paragraphs on average but I can write more if you write more. The genres I like to make plots for are romance, fantasy, adventure, in mostly medieval or any setting that isn't modern day.\nI don't have one particular plot in mind so I would love to hear your ideas. I do not rp with minors so please be 18+, and I am not comfortable rping with or as a furry, cannon character, or famous person. \nWhen it comes to anything nsfw I prefer that it doesn't over take the story of the rp. \nPlease have decent grammer I know we all make mistakes but please have writing that is at least readable.\nPlease dm me. I will not be responding in the comments.\n\nLastly I do have a setting I would like to be able to set an rp in. Which is pretty much urban fantasy in the victorian era, fairies, centaur, goblins, saytrs, trolls, orcs, elves, and other creatures live amongst the citizens of london after escaping their war ridden countries. They are mostly on the lowest social rung of the ladder but a few have succeeded in getting into the high society. I would love to be able to create a plot surrounding this world.

there lovely people. I would love to chat with you all but I have decided to narrow my points down from characters and the like to something relatively simple just having fun and making some enjoyable plots together! Below we will have several plots relating to some of my favorite kinks along with sexy images as a gift for even bothering to read through a post like mine! Make sure you read things thoroughly by the way just for safety's sake!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now then a few simple rules!:**\n \n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- I am 21, all characters portrayed in this roleplay will be above the age of 18 with no expedition!**\n \n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- I am a sub. Technically I am a switch with an extreme sub lean but if you want me to do you you had better bring something super detailed or super interesting. (essentially 99.9% sub 00.1% dom)**\n \n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- I will provide examples of weird kinks through images, or examples I have pre written! So if you see something here you don't know about or that interests you just feel free to ask!**\n \n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- I prefer my roleplays detailed, please dont message me with a simple hello at least: Your name, a ref, a bit about yourself. and optionally: a kink list, a plot, a fun fact, or something generally lewd! we won't be jumping right into rp we will most likely plot for a bit!**\n \n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- I do greatly prefer FEMALE OR FUTA dominants but if your a dude willing to play as either of these that is also fine (Super cute dom femboys also approved~)**\n \n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- Images are appreciated or very detailed descriptions! I have a few do pictures laying around i can offer ya however if you need some!**\n \n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- I play as female characters, male characters, and femboy characters. Transformation is something I enjoy however so do not be afraid to ask me to change what I am looking to play!**\n \n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow then with the long boring section of the post out of the way we can move onto some of the plots I have that are currently in progress! Many of these are made from comics and the like that interest me so I'm sorry if you don't understand anything in them. As well, a majority of them were made on the spot when ideas came into my head! At the end I'll provide a full kink list for posterity's sake! Now then onto the plots and their details!\n\nThe Toys~ :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA mysterious benefactor for failing streamers. To get a sponsorship from this company one must inbox one of their many items on stream and look over it even play with it if you feel so compelled~ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey have such wonderful toys as the: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ahegao Dragon:** The dragon itself has a mild hypnotic aura around it compelling those that are nearby to at first do mild lewd acts such as lick the dragon, maybe then to suck on it then to insert it into another hole. The more it is held licked and sucked the more the user will change, growing sluttier, more feminine and the like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rubber Suit Parts:** Cute, slutty and always fun these suits are guaranteed to change the user and their channel for the better! As a challenge put on each piece of the suit over time although you may find them hard to take off the more you put on. First the paws, then the body then the legs finally they just sit there smiling at the cameras their new personality is installed with the head piece! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Support Controller:** This pink controller when used to play any form of game with support characters in it will influence the player to choose a character who primarily functions to support the team. The user will feel compelled to heal and support the team as much as possible and will receive considerable pleasure for doing so; however if they do a single point of damage during that entire game they will find themselves unable to achieve orgasam for 24 hours. If they make it through a game without dealing any damage while supporting their team they will orgasam immediately reinforcing the want to play support over and over!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Clothing Care Package:** A care package of adorable feminine and very girly but extremely hip clothing, the fabric when touched sends gentle waves of pleasure through the body and if worn compels the user to wear it more and more even making them want to order further care packages. Eventuallyit will compel them to wear the clothes in public and throw away all other clothes besides the aforementioned clothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cat Girl Headphones~:** Cute pink and black headphones with large cat ears attached to them, they play passive hypnotic suggestions through the worlds highest quality speakers eventually making the wearer end every sentence with a cute Nya as well as occasionally act very lewd they also begin filtering in kink suggestions from the chat of the streamer wearing them to great effect!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Think up more ideas]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't look into them to much however so many of these streamers have grown to be some of the most successful streamers on various websites~ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Bunny Farm:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave You ever wondered where all those cute bunny girls come from, well I did now i'm going to find out. I found someone willing to take me to the place they all supposedly come from. Little did I know they were going to drug me and throw me in their trunk now I'm going to see what the process is like first hand!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere at Bunny Farms we take security very seriously as you can see this is a testimonial from one of our bunny girls in training in one of her more lucid moments fun fact she used to be a he and now she can only think cute happy sexy slutty thoughts so come on down and join today!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A Futa Under Lock And Key:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend is a futa, one kind of down on her luck, she was out of work and desperately needed money so she signed up for this experiment where her cock was placed in a chastity cage for four months. She complained the entire time but was given more than enough money for the experiment. She even moved into a new place and apparently had enough to pay for rent in advance, ten YEARS in advance. For some reason she invited me over to wonder what she wanted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I don't know is the purpose of the experiment, to test the feminizing and addictive qualities of futa cum when it has been backed up for a long period of time and she has not cum in four months… This will be fun for her~ a new toy and more money than she could ever need.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n{Even the scientists didn't know how potent her cum would become and the fact that lasting this long means that all cum she produces from now on will be just as strong~}\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The restaurant~:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA new restaurant has moved into town (along the lines of a femboy hooters) outside stands a massive sign stating that they are hiring and the many benefits of working at the establishment. The pay, the training, the new friends and so much more! And would you look at how cute the staff is~ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Cafe~:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur college always had this rumor, that there was a Cafe downtown that had really cute servers, tanned skin, blond hair, ditzy airhead personalities in general. It was supposedly amazing! I was the top of the class and well kinda stressed out with exams coming up so I decided to hunt for this Cafe. Oh boy did I find it~ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo then thank you all for reading this far if you have in your first message tell me what plot here interested you or share your own idea!

How are you doing today? You look a little stressed. Is everything good? Is work too busy? How about your relationship? Is everything good on that front? Your sex life is healthy? I know it seems a bit too forward of me to ask that so directly, but it is important to not let so much stress build up inside you. Mental health is very very important, and you should be taking care of yourself. You look like you have a loads of umm... tension in your body. I think it's important that we take care of that. You know, massages are really good for that. It might seem unrelated, but muscle tension and mental tension are extremely correlated. So relieving one, can help relieve the other.   \n\n\nActually, you know what would be best? A sexual massage. There's no reason to give me that weird look! It's true! Cumming is a great stress buster. It releases oxytocin which is a hormone that helps you destress. Plus, as your body builds up an orgasm over time, it also tenses up a little, and when you cum, you're able to release all of that tension - which as I told you before, also helps release your mental tension. I honestly think that would be great for you. Would you like me to help you with it? I am pretty good at it. After all, I'll do whatever I can to help you!  \n\n\n \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  \nSo the prompt is simple enough :) All I want to do here is to help you out.

I love being competitive and dominating PVP but I would like to have some laughs\/enjoy my time also. If you already have two and are looking for one more or you are LFG, PM me on discord!\n\nAcyerion#1922","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"playrustlfg","subreddit_id":"t5_300n4","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/playrustlfg","subreddit_subscribers":34569,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Looking for Mature and Experienced Trio","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/playrustlfg\/comments\/pfijzw\/looking_for_mature_and_experienced_trio\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

If she does, I'm referred to as Baby Momma, not my name.\n\nMy partner and I haven't been together long, so on one hand I can understand why it's more natural to gravitate towards the baby's status and wellbeing, but we've made it clear we're committed and together, so it would seem natural to also get to know and care about me. It has me feeling a bit like an incubation station for the grandchildren she wishes her own children would have but won't. I myself didn't have the closest, if any relationship, to my grandparents so this behavior seems a bit much to me. Am I overreacting?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BabyBumps","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7cl","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BabyBumps","subreddit_subscribers":309672,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Family calling it \"our\" baby","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.95,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BabyBumps\/comments\/pfio9j\/family_calling_it_our_baby\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I'm a pretty calm guy, and can be described as introverted.\n\nI have a kitten. His name is Robin and he's a conniving little guy. He's got stubby little legs and I can send pictures.\n\nI am looking for a long term relationship, so anyone looking for something short term or one night stands or the like, this isn't for you.\n\nI want to put my cards on the table here. When I date, I date for marriage. I date to look for that special someone to give myself to completely. If that sounds like the kind of thing you are looking for as well, then please, read on!\n\nI keep finding people on here who I seem to click with, we have great convos, then just ghost me. Please don't do that. If you don't want to talk after a bit, just tell me. It hurts me every time. \n\n**So here's some of my interests**\n\n\\-reading, with action\/adventure fiction being my main book choice. A couple of my favorite series are Percy Jackson and Alex Rider.\n\n\\-I love astronomy, and really anything space related. Even just looking out at the stars. I also love watching SpaceX test launches.\n\n\\-General nerdy pursuits, like games (PC and Switch if you're interested), comics, computers, and movies. I've got a heck of a lot of memes to share if you're into that.\n\n\\-I play DnD\n\n\\-Cars in general. BMWs are my favorite\n\n\\-my favorite shows include Top Gear, The Grand Tour, Parks and Rec, King of the Hill and AtLA\n\n\\-favorite movies include Scott Pilgrim vs the World, Marvel movies, and Star Wars.\n\n\\-I don't watch a ton of anime, but I'm currently watching Great Pretender on Netflix, and am waiting for Jojo Part 6\n\n\\-I watch some football and am a Minnesota Vikings fan. SKOL!\n\nFun Fact: I am a world record speedrunner for the game Ooga Booga for Sega Dreamcast\n\n**My Physical traits:**\n\n\\-I'm 5'8\", white, blue eyes, brown hair. I wear glasses, and have some facial hair.\n\n\\-I'm somewhere between skinny and average build\n\n\\-I'm down to swap pics once we talk a bit\n\nPreferences (not deal-breakers):\n\n-I'm not super picky about age, just be above 18, but not over 30.\n-christian\n-politically conservative\n-at least somewhat in shape\n\nDealbreakers:\n- please be drug free\n\nBut anyway, if you want to talk and see where it goes, I'm fine with both DMs and chat.

I try my best to make sure to reply to everyone, and so far have done quite well.  But it’s the potential victims that have fascinated me.  I’ve had many conversations with potential victims from all over the world.  California, Las Vegas, Indianapolis, Pennsylvania, New Brunswick, Maryland, the UK, South Africa, all asking for me to visit. Oh to have unlimited funds, a true “Rape ‘round the world!” Tour. 2018.  No opening acts.\n\nFinding someone in the Seattle Area has been like trying to find a shinier needle in a haystack of needles, but there have been some.  We would start talking and start working things out, then things would taper off for various reasons.  \n\nBut one, one finally came through. \n\n(Pun 100% intended)\n\nWe PM’d here, then went to Kik and talked and negotiated.  She couldn’t host so I agreed to use my place, and as she is 22 and I am 48, we decided to do a “Kindly old neighbor showing me a new video game” scenario.   Due to a timing issue we had to talk for an additional week before meeting, which had us talking about lots of different topics, and it turned out we had a lot in common.  This surprised me given the age difference but it turns out she’s just a young woman who is an old soul.  \n\nThe side effect of this was her worry that I wouldn’t be able to scare her.  That in the end she’d think of me as this sweet man whose made her feel comfortable and safe to be her first “rapist”.  I tried to explain to her that the “rapist” side of me is not my day to day person, and that he is, in a word, meaner.  She however had her doubts, regardless of my warnings.\n\nInitially we were going to save our first meeting for the day of the rape, but the both of us got so excited that when a window opened we decided to try an “Uber driver raping his passenger” scenario.  Then have the in my home rape be the second one.  \n\nWe did meet and gave it a go, but due to various reasons things didn’t work out exactly like we hoped.  We started but had some logistics issues that made us realize the car was a bad first rape attempt.  It was however an eye opening experience for the following reasons:\n\n1)            She was much more attractive than her already beautiful pictures looked. \n2)            A 2013 Kia Soul is NOT a good rape vehicle for a 6’ tall man.\n3)            My “Demon side” scared the shit out of her.\n\nWe spent the time chatting and getting to know each other, and decided we’d save the real deal for the house.\n\nThe night before we keep kiking and confirming all the pieces of the scenario, the safe words, directions, and what she needs to bring.  She was a little nervous and wanted an idea how it would start, and I did warn her she’d be pushed against the wall and I would convince her to put her hands on the wall while I molested her.  She scoffed at that, saying that since she met the demon she doubted she would be so surprised by him again.  I told her some variant of “If you say so.” \n\nAs I live with my son I don’t have BDSM equipment laying around anywhere, so I made do with a couple of old out of style ties from back in my “Mr. Businessman” days, and setup four points to tie her down with.  It’s a personal policy of mine that the first rape should never be restrained, as I don’t feel like I would have earned it then.  A secondary piece of that policy is: If they get away, the game is over.   She was aware of the policy and vowed to fight tooth and nail.\n\nShe arrived and played off being the daughter of a neighbor friend, met my dog and sat down to play some “Cuphead” on my Xbox.  The conversation was light, mostly about her classes and her frustration with the game. (Cuphead is not for the faint of heart fellow gamers, requires timing and concentration and is very unforgiving of mistakes.  What? The Rape? Ohh right sorry!)\n\n\nAfter about 20 minutes of gameplay she was quite ready to throw the controller.  I offered to give her a quick tour of the house before she had to leave for school.  We walked around as I explained the various amenities of my rented house, leading to the basement where my secondary game room was, and finally my room.  \n\nI described it as the best room in the house as we walked in.  Once inside she asked if it’s because it was my room, hardly noticing that I had already closed and locked the door.  I responded that it was but also..\n\nI then grabbed her by her hair and put my other hand at her throat.\n\n“..the room I’m raping you in.”\n\nWith a push she was on the floor at the foot of my bed, she started begging and damn did she do a fine job with that, I stood her up by grabbing her hair and picking her up.  I’m 6’ and she’s around 5’5”.  She didn’t have a chance.  I slapped her face twice then pushed her down again into another part of the room.  She tried to scramble away but I easily strode over (perhaps even strutted over) picked her up by the hair again, and threw her back In front of the bed.  \n\nDisoriented she tried to get up but didn’t have a chance, grabbing her long hair again, I stood her up, and took her by the throat with my other hand, then I pushed her hard into the wall.  I let go of her hair but kept a hand at her throat, and started running my hands down her body which she attempted to block, but I grabbed her hair from the top and slammed her into the wall hard and screamed at her to put her hands against the wall.\n\nShe immediately did.\n\nScore one for the demon.\n\nTwo slaps and a reminder to keep them there, and I ran my hands up her thighs then slid down her tights and started rubbing her bald pussy.  My other hand was still at her throat squeezing but her hands didn’t fight, she pleaded and begged and tried to shrink down a little bit but my hand kept her up for the molesting.  \n\nI threw her onto the bed, and she tried to scramble away, but I had her tights and panties off so fast you’d think she was being raped by “The Flash”.  Grabbed her hair and threw her back on the floor, and she slightly slid into the wall.  I had her t-shirt off almost as fast, I wore sweatpants and had them and my shirt off before she could move, and then grabbed her and threw her back on the bed on her stomach, where she tried to fight me off but I unclasped her bra and tossed them aside. \n\nTurning her to her back, I upped my slap game, big time.  I’d say at least 10 slaps on each cheek to control her, and to her credit she didn’t quite give up, but she was just about there.  She was begging me not to rape her.  I raised and slammed her head into the mattress several times while I told her that I want to rape her.  That I hadn’t had tight young cunt in a while and was overdue.  \n\nShe whimpered a bit and pleaded again, I noticed a ring on her finger and asked if she was engaged, she covered it with a hand and man did she have a tight grip on that, so I screamed inches from her face to “ANSWER THE FUCKING QUESTION” and implied she would be buried in my backyard when I was done and she released it and barely whispered a yes.\n\nLaughing, I sat her up and laid down, I told her that if she wanted to get out of this intact all she had to do was stroke my cock.  She pleaded and shook her head so I gave her a couple of slaps and reminded her how much worse it could be.  Her hand was shaking as she started to stroke me, I had one hand on her other free wrist, and the other deep in her hair.  She may have thought about going somewhere but she wasn’t.  \n\nAfter a few moments encouraging and pretending like I was close, I finally had enough games and pulled her down on her back by the end of my bed. Before she could even protest I was between her legs and she screamed as I slid inside her. I held her throat and started a furious pounding that slowly started edging her off the bed. Now she was dangling off the end still begging me to stop, she was no longer trying to push me off, she was trying to hold herself up which was perfect.  \n\nSomething to note about my rapes: I refrain from masturbation for at least a week prior to the rape.  After the previous night’s failure I STILL had a full complement of cum ready to go.   So I am unashamed to say that thanks to that, her performance, and a wonderfully tight cunt it did not take long for me to cum, which I did with first a growl, then a howl, and finally a laugh.  \n\nThen I pushed her off the bed the rest of the way.\n\nI sat on the floor laughing as she whimpered and tried to crawl away from me.  I found her panties and wiped my cock with it.  I threw it aside then got up, a little shakily admittedly.  Then picked her up and threw her on the bed to give her something she requested, with my own little twist on it.\n\nI laid her on her back and grabbed her throat.  I told her to finger herself.  She said no and please, and I told her that I got what I wanted so maybe I should just bury her in the yard.  Slowly she started to finger herself as I squeezed her neck.  Whimpering, and maybe crying, it was hard to tell, I was too focused on what was to come.  \n\nAfter a moment or two, and some words of encouragement it was time:  Like a hungry vampire I opened my mouth wide, and brought it down to her right upper thigh and bit as hard as I could.  \n\nShe screamed. But after a brief pause she kept fingering as I bit.    Satisfied I sat up, and a huge bitemark was there on her thigh. She whimpered, and I laughed.\n\n“Now you’ll always be mine.” I said. \n\nWe put the scene on hold.  Had a nice lunch and talked and held onto each other while we watched a little TV.  After lunch we went back down and fooled around for hours.  With less than 30 minutes left before she had to leave she started playfully stroke my cock and when I asked what she was going to do with it now she told me \n\n“I want the demon back..”\n\nPressed for time, he made his appearance and without hesitating had her on her back by her throat, slapping her face several times while screaming that she doesn’t call him, he comes when he wants.  I was inside her immediately, held her struggling arms in a single hand by the wrists, then turned my right hand into a claw which I dug into her left tit hard.  \n\n“IT HURTS!” she screamed, and I almost faltered, but when I checked she just smiled and said she didn’t call a safe word.\n\nGood girl I thought, and may have said.  Game on, and she struggled mightily but couldn’t prevent my third orgasm of the day, which I greeted with a howl and a laugh, then I gave her a few more slaps to prove a point, and again wiped my cock with her panties. \n\nExhausted, we called the scene and held each other for a few minutes before I walked her out.  We made plans for another rape-date and bemoaned the time before it happened.  She then left.\n\nShe texted me when she got home, made it clear she had a wonderful day, loved her new mark and enjoyed touching it to remember. Admitted that once again the demon had scared her, and that she really had a good day, but liked playing with the demon a little more.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":true,"subreddit":"u_AShyViolentRapist","subreddit_id":"t5_9bs26","subreddit_name_prefixed":"u\/AShyViolentRapist","subreddit_subscribers":0,"subreddit_type":"user","suggested_sort":"qa","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Rape Hire: A Redditors Rape","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.96,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/u_AShyViolentRapist\/comments\/pfiu5e\/rape_hire_a_redditors_rape\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I am married to a girl I have been with for almost 5 years. We mortgage a house, and have a decent amount of surplus income. We both own our own vehicles outright. We are utilitarian in nature, with little interest in impressing people. In other words, we don't have any spending problems to note. She makes about $16\/hour, and I make about $18\/hour where we work now. I am currently in school paid for by my company to push me towards becoming an engineer. I do expect to see a decent pay increase around mid-2023 with my graduation with an associates degree. I will then continue school into university and will take 3-3.5 years to finish my bachelor's.  \n\n\nOn to the question at hand, how do people have children right now? My wife is getting the baby fever pretty bad, and we have agreed to start trying after our honeymoon this upcoming March. As of right now, I don't see how having a child would be feasible. I would be able to JUST BARELY afford to keep our house and everything on inside it, but that doesn't factor food, phones, or insurance.   \n\n\nWe are able to lean on our parents a bit, but my parents are big on not being used as babysitters all the time (My mom works from home, and my dad infrequently travels). Her parents are not able to help with babysitting because her older sister has 2 children she needs her parents to look after already. It would be almost exclusively weekends that they could help us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife and I agreed that she would be a stay at home mom for the first 5 years or so until school is able to take them for hours per day and she can begin looking to get a real career going for herself. Because of this, is there any advice to making ends work in this kind of situation? I am desperate to not be an old parent that doesn't understand what their kid is dealing with. I also don't want to be a burden to my parents who are only just recently successful, and want even less for my kid to ever know we are poor or ever were.

However, there are some things that need to be repaired or replaced;\n\n* Septic leach field is in very poor condition and needs to be replaced.\n\n* one of the tile showers has poor floor pitch and does not drain correctly because the drain is higher.\n\n* AC Condenser and Mini splits will not blow cold air. Either needs to be replaced or repaired.\n\nAfter residing in the duplex for a year, my original plan was to move out and rent out that side so I can start turning a positive cashflow on the property, however after reading more and more about septic systems I am not sure that will pan out super nicely. It seems like these can be a headaches for rentals with backing up since tenants may just flush water down the drains, which will incur costs on me to have it pumped often. One last thing is that the ceiling on the side I will reside on for the kitchen is super low at 6'2 only.

My name is Ammon. I am 23 years old and I want to leave my home here in America and move to Japan... permanently.\n\n**Storytime:**\n\nI have lived in America all of my life and I do not know an ounce of Japanese. I grew up in the state of Indiana, and went to high school in Idaho. I've lived in California, Arkansas, Illinois, and Kansas City, and I have absolutely loved getting to experience new things, meet new people, and learn from others in this world.\n\nAbout 3 years ago I began to study a lot about Japan after meeting a very nice old woman and her son who were visiting America from Japan. The woman had dual citizenship in both countries as her Japanese husband met her while on a business trip to America. She packed up her life in America and moved to Japan with no knowledge of the country, no knowledge of the language or understanding of the culture. Although it was very hard for her, she said it was the best thing that had ever happened to her. I spoke with them for hours about Japanese culture and lifestyle and (although I know it most definitely is not ALL sunshine and rainbows) I immediately knew I wanted to live there.\n\nI traveled around the states some more, worked for many different places and studied a LOT about Japan... It has now been 3 years and I feel that I have been putting off the inevitable. I want to move to Japan.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\nI am reaching out to this wonderful group on reddit because I see you have built a community on helping one another and I know I will need all of the help I can get.\n\nI have no debt and no other obligations to take care of (other than my immediate family who I would be sure to visit often and would support my decision to move abroad).\n\nI wish to move to the Tokyo area in Japan.\n\nI have a variety of experience in the work force. Lately my expertise has been in the solar industry at a massive corporation in Utah. I enjoy my office job and love the benefits it has provided to me and I am open to most ANY work type (aside from teaching English as I am looking for more long term stability and a company to grow with).\n\n**I need your help:**\n\n**I recognize that this is a lot to ask but I would love to receive help from anyone and everyone who can offer their assistance. Whether you have lived in Japan, are living in Japan, or know a lot about moving permanently to another country- I could really use your help and feedback and how I might go about achieving my dream. Even if you know a nice family in Japan that just needs a personal assistant with a variety of talents or store or shop or small business owner that would be helping me to relocate that would be great. LITERALLY ANY IDEAS I AM OPEN TO LISTENING TO.**\n\nIt is just a matter of time now, but I do plan on moving to Japan. Hopefully sooner rather than later. I appreciate your time in reading this. Feel free to reply to this post or message me personally to chat. I would love to hear from any of you in this community!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"movingtojapan","subreddit_id":"t5_3fy6c","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/movingtojapan","subreddit_subscribers":59650,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I want to drop everything and move to Japan...
