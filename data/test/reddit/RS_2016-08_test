Before I post a photo of my rectum I'll explain my situation. I am going to get tested but I live an hour from the nearest clinic and I don't drive. There is a mobile clinic that comes next month. I am 17 male and my last encounter was 7 months ago with a female(no anal) and we had about 5 minutes of unprotected sex. I was being dumb and put numbing cream on my penis then a condom to last longer didn't feel the condom breaking. The girl didn't have anything I saw and when I asked she jokingly said maybe and that freaked me out. \n\nSo, 7 months pass and no symptoms. No burning, or bumps or anything strange. About 2 weeks ago I was going to hook up with the girl again but I freaked out cause it reminded me of what she said. I started checking my body again(didnt see anything*) and a couple days ago I went to the bathroom(ate very spicey wings the night before) and I had fire butt. This one hurt!! I had to wash my butt to get rid of the pain. When I wiped I noticed very little dots of blood on the tp. It did hurt for about 5 mins after. I washed my rectum and took a photo to exam my rear. I had some red areas that some were long and some were dots. Maybe 5-6 around my rectum/in my rectum. It didn't look like pimples and when I searched for herpes and for fissures I didnt find anything matching. \n\n*I didn't see anything but when I pulled my cheeks apart I did notice an area that looked like pimples but it looks like my hair follicles. Not pimples as I see for herpes on google. I did have a bit of itching but I did shave my pubic hair. Nothing around my penis or on my penis just on my rectum. Is this herpes? \n\nEdit... Its been 2 days since my pain ful bm. Only the  larger ones remain the smaller \"cuts\" are gone. \n\nI did say I wouldn't attach the photo but for anyone who wants to see it. Here you go.

Heh. I might be a throwawaydaddy but my face is here somewhere as well as many more posts lol\n\n\nHey guys, it's gonna be another wall of text. So I'm 24 and I've been with my 19 yr old boyfriend for 7 months (and one day). I have full custody of my two kids and though they are taken care of, I'm trying to get life moving into the right direction.\n\n\nI'm normally a better writer but is goin to be pretty fucked up and all over the place, sorry lol\n\n\nGot divorced one year ago! Was done with my ex for about 3 years mentally as I lost my attraction and any feelings for her, since she was a piece of shit. She lied about being able to get pregnant, and she didn't tell me she had a 3 yr old daughter UNTIL she got pregnant. I know, I'm stupid as fuck for believe her, but I was a dumb straight 19 yr old virgin. Fast forward through the shittty marriage and divorce, I have custody of the kids. It's what I wanted and life is rough, but whatever.\n\n\nStarted fucking around on tinder but didn't have too much luck with the ladies. Then I matched with my boyfriend after putting on the guy option too. Sex was amazing from the start and he was also really cool to be with, something I never experienced with a woman. Like, I've never just been able to be friends like that with a girl at least while sexually involved, maybe I have issues. went on a short vacation for thanksgiving only to realize I was becoming obsessed with the guy, and once I got back home I decided I had to spill my feelings and go for him.\n\n\nEver since the beginning of our relationship in December, it's been a tough time trying to get him to trust me, since he was projecting his hookup past onto me for so many months and just couldn't believe that I was into him. He thought I was just saying I liked him to fuck with him (not fuck him, but actually just lie and be mean). I accepted that it was going to be a crazy relationship but hey, he was the first person in my life that I viewed as a friend AND someone I was sexually compatible with. He was really special to me and I had never felt such infatuation for someone before, even to the extent of the whole \"I love you's\" coming WAYYY too soon lmao. \n\n\nThe relationship was typically filled with him becoming jealous over little things here and there and stuff like that. Typical petty fem guy, but he was cute and worth it to me. For the most part though, the relationship was perfect and in my view, romantic.\n\n\nAs I'm typing there's no way I have the patience to type everything on my phone regarding the relationship lol, but here's where things get weird. This past month or so has been an absolute clusterfuck of rage and depression. Some guy in a semi wrecked my new vehicle, and that fucked things up pretty bad. My boyfriends nuggets swell up and he said that the car accident did it and threw a guilt trip on me about it (since after the crash I wasn't asking enough if he was ok). Next thing I know he told me he jacked off and blood came out. He had chlamydia from his hoe days and never fully got treated so I had it for all these months with no symptoms. Still dealing with that, hopefully I don't get a call back from planned parenthood. I didn't accuse him of cheating but it did make me think. Fast forward a few weeks and I get a few tickets that further drain my account. That's life I guess. Fast forward a few weeks and I wreck my motorcycle, break my ankle, and now I've been on disability and will be for another month and a half. Losing my shitty job in the process since it was a temp agency. My mind has been on overdrive.\n\n\nOur relationship has had ups and down and amidst an argument last night, he did say at the end he'd love to move in with me and be with me (it's something we talked about before). Now today, he's wanting to break up with me because I got upset last night that he asked about my sexual past with men (only have done things to him, had two other half experiences with guys). Pissed me off because I don't get the smugness of saying the same, he knows I know his history, yet for some reason him asking me is him wanting to know me more. He instigated these fucking questions last night when I've been feeling like a worthless sack of shit with my ankle brace. \n\n\nIt's worth noting that before the accident I had 3 days off on 3 months and was doing physical work. Now I have all the time in the world and even more time with the kids but I'm losing money and I can't even really do much with the kids anyways.\n\n\nI always knew it was a matter of time  for a breakup because he told me he never wanted kids and showed no interest back in February, and I was ok with that, because in my mind I'm ok with being a single dad forever, even if it meant having a boyfriend not involved with them. I'm not looking for a partner to help raise the kids at all. That and he's 19, so I have empathy in the sense of having parenthood being pushed on me.\n\n\nI'm forgetting what I'm typing because I'm running on no sleep and my eyes burn lol. It's pretty clear he wants to break up with me tonight. I know I shouldn't even be freaking out about it, I'm a grown ass man who was married for 4 years and has two kids and he's just some lil fem boy. I don't understand wtf he did to me but I just wanted to rant to you guys seeing as how I'm on this sub all the time.\n\n\n\nHe's the only person I've ever loved in a relationship. I didn't love my wife. These have also been the happiest/best/worst months of my life. It's also crazy because it's only 7 months but I guess we were hanging out pretty often so it seems longer.\n\n\nDamn you gay relationships. I'm pretty jaded right now. Now I understand these silly posts that pop up all the time. I mean if you see my post history you'd see that for the most part I was happy (except for the other time I thought we were breakup up lmao). I'm a pretty simple guy, I just wanted someone to be with. But I guess we were fucked from the start.\n\n\nIdk who I'm even attracted to anymore. Women are sex objects to me and gays have their own set of insane problems to me lol. The first gay relationship I had was a fucking roller coaster lol. More sex in 7 months than in 4 years. \n\n\n\nTL;DR breaking up with fem boy. My ankle hurts. Disability. Angry and sad. Trying to be the best daddy\n\n\n\nEDIT: yeah he broke up with me. He said he lied to make me feel better about moving in with me since he didn't want me to get too upset. Feels bad man. He does wanna be my best friend still, and honestly he's the only friend I have out here. I feel pretty weak, it sucks being on disability cause it's like I'm forced to think about it. Kids are at school. But yeah, one of the most painful things is that I wasn't perfect and I did hurt him throughout the relationship, and that I lost him, but I guess that's life. The thought of moving on makes me sick. I meeean aside from all this bullshit I do feel like I'm okay, just really dejected about my condition and not working enough.\n\n\n\nAnyone around LA know of better work opportunities?\n\n\nEdit edit: at least insurance is faulting the truck driver 100%. Tho I'm 100% at fault for my motorcycle they're giving me more than it's worth to get another.

Advice please!","media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","ups":1,"secure_media_embed":{},"num_comments":3,"link_flair_text":"Retirement","selftext":"Hi PF,\n\nI recently finished a Master\u2019s in Teaching program and accepted a teaching job in my local district on Thursday. I am 26, and my salary will be $56k. I spent this morning signing up for benefits, but I am looking for some advice in the selection of my retirement options. The way things are structured does not align with the sequence in which I have laid out financial goals. Here\u2019s my debt situation:\n\n**Current Debt**\n*Credit Card: $10,000\n*Student Loans: $54,000\n\nI know this is a sizable amount of debt, but I have done some spreadsheeting and I anticipate I could pay it off in ~3 years. I am of the mindset that investing should not be done until one is out of debt; however, the State retirement system for teachers is mandatory and requires a selection among two options, both of which have a required contribution. So, that means that I will be simultaneously contributing to retirement and paying down debt, and I\u2019m trying to find the best balance between my long-term investment goals and my short-term debt-snowball momentum.\n\n**Plan 1** is a Defined Benefit in which I and my employer each contribute 2% towards a pension. Pretty straightforward.\n\n**Plan 2** is a combination Defined Benefit/Defined Contribution plan. The Defined Benefit portion is a fixed 1% personal/1% match towards a pension. The Defined Contribution portion is where things get complicated. There is no employer match, and there are options about what types of investments can be purchased ranging from a complete auto-pilot fund, to Target Date-style funds, to decent index funds. The options are rather limited in fund choices, but they are decent.\n\nThe Defined Contribution portion requires me to choose one of the following contribution plans:\nA: 5% all ages\nB: 5% to age 35, 6% to 44, 7.5% 45+\nC: 6% to age 35, 7.5% to age 44, 8.5% 45+\nD: 7% all ages\nE: 10% all ages\nF: 15% all ages\n\nHere\u2019s where the dilemma comes in, **once I choose a contribution rate, I cannot change it unless I switch employers** (meaning: leaving the district). This is a large urban district and I intend to stay here for a minimum of 5 years. Even if I go elsewhere, I will still be a part of the same state retirement system. The only thing that would be able to change is my contribution rate.. My long-term personal investment philosophy is to contribute 15% of income, BUT I planned to do that after getting out of debt (again, ~3 years). If I were to select option F, that would delay paying off my debts for about another year. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s significant in the scheme of things, but I\u2019ve heard paying off debts is 80% emotional and I think it may be nice to have that faster traction in getting out of debt.\n\nSo, here are the three options I can see at this point. \n\n1.\tRecognize that the $5500 IRA annual limit is ~10% of my income. Due to this, choose option A (5%) to maximize my debt-repayment in the short-term. Once I have my debts paid off, then I can add in another 10% contribution via IRA for 15% total. The disadvantage I see here is that as my income goes up, $5500 will be a smaller and smaller share contribution as a percentage, meaning that within 5 or so years I\u2019ll be creeping lower than 15% total contribution. The advantage is that I have more fund choices.\n2.\tChoose option F so that I can always have a 15% contribution. The disadvantage here is that it eats up a lot more money per month in the short-term which I want to focus on debt repayment.\n3.\tA combination of the two, via one of the other contribution plans (C?) \n\nWhich of these sounds more aligned with my goals? Is there another option I\u2019m not considering? Thanks for the input.\n\n**EDIT: One last factor I'm considering is the tax-free vs. tax-deferred growth debate. Another potential advantage I see to doing some of my investing in an IRA is that I have a Roth option whereas my State retirement options are tax-deferred.**\n\nKevin","from_kind":null,"is_self":true,"stickied":false,"hide_score":false,"permalink":"/r/personalfinance/comments/4vk06g/26_yo_new_job_question_regarding_balancing_paying/","from_id":null,"name":"t3_4vk06g","over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_css_class":"Retirement","downs":0,"author_flair_text":null,"gilded":0,"locked":false,"edited":1470013711,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4vk06g/26_yo_new_job_question_regarding_balancing_paying/","secure_media":null,"archived":false,"id":"4vk06g","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473005884,"domain":"self.personalfinance"}

About a week later, a buddy and I went to my brothers house and we're having some drinks, and then they decided they wanted to go out to the bars. I was still very sober at this point, so I just told my brother, \"Hey if we're going out and I'm going to continue to drink, I need a place to put my rig.\" He had me give it to him and he and his friends were all surprised that they couldn't tell I was carrying.

{"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"stickied":false,"from_kind":null,"selftext":"Hi guys,\n\nLike the title says, I'm an equity research analyst at a bulge bracket investment bank in NYC. I'm 28 years old and have been doing equity research since graduating college in 2010. I've covered 3 different sectors at 3 different banks since graduating. \n\nI originally took the research role because I thought I wanted to be on the buyside in some investment analyst role. I've come to discover that I don't think I would prefer that all too much now. I'm still open to that route but there are a variety of reasons why I think I'm better suited for something else. My issue is that I do not want to be an equity research analyst my whole life but the more time I spend in research, the deeper the whole I find myself in and the more entrenched in research I become. \n\nI've been starting to look into some type of business development or FP&amp;A type role at a corporation. I believe I have developed a very good analytical skill set and understand a host of different companies in different industries. I would like to work at a company in a role where I can impact growth instead of just following the progression of the companies I currently cover.\n\nI have a couple of questions/concerns that I was hoping you guys could help me with since I don't have any colleagues that work in a corporate capacity. Thanks in advance to anyone who can help:\n\n1 - I'd like to stay in the New York area. I understand I'd likely take a haircut on salary at first but how difficult is it to progress up the corporate ladder? I know some people move out of NYC where the cost of living is less so the drop in salary isn't that impactful but I cannot do that. I'm sure this is a very company-specific  question but if anyone has any experiences, I'd love to hear them. I've heard from people that having a finance/banking background and work ethic is very helpful versus people who have been in a non-banking role their entire life.\n\n2 - Is 28 too late to be making this move? I don't have an MBA but did go to a good college. Will I likely have to take a more entry level position to just get my foot in the door?\n\n3 - Would love to hear if anyone else has any specific experience with making a move like this and what they thought about it. I'm also afraid that by \"going corporate\", I may be closing myself off to returning back to research/buyside if it doesn't workout. Does anyone have any experience or thoughts here?\n\nAgain, sorry for the long winded email. I appreciate all the help. I've only begun my search process but would like to gather as many facts about the process before I begin applying or interviewing more seriously.","author_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"author_flair_text":null,"downs":0,"hide_score":false,"permalink":"/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4vkcuj/questions_on_leaving_equity_research_for/","name":"t3_4vkcuj","from_id":null,"id":"4vkcuj","distinguished":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4vkcuj/questions_on_leaving_equity_research_for/","locked":false,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"secure_media":null,"domain":"self.FinancialCareers","retrieved_on":1473006064,"score":4,"media_embed":{},"created_utc":1470018348,"author":"bjfinn44","quarantine":false,"saved":false,"from":null,"subreddit":"FinancialCareers","title":"Questions on leaving equity research for corporate FP&amp;A or business development role","thumbnail":"self","subreddit_id":"t5_2scvl","media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"num_comments":4,"ups":4}

All the shit and actual bullets people cop in this world simply for shit like being the 'wrong' color? The problems of the white middle class tend to be that they are the source of problems for everyone else). I don't relate well to others because I think they're we're all pretty awful. \n\nSo growing up I didn't complain, tried as much as I could to approximate being 'perfect' and concentrated on keeping up that front. Was moderately successful at papering over the cracks. But some people are good at seeing through this need to please and exploit it. Was not treated well by some standard issue nasty suburban boys. Even that is overstating it, I was never physically harmed. But I'll say this, gossip is not the sole purview of girls and when boys decide to go after your reputation it can be quite traumatic and leave you open to others thinking they'll get away with making you feel unsafe ...

Relationship lasted ten years, he left me for someone younger/more fun and had a baby with her within the year.  Can't blame him really. He had his own problems with keeping up appearances over some cracks in his psyche. Like attracts like. He got sick of me as he got better. Fair enough! Oh! He once tried to strangle me and used to shove me around. I was a drinker and he'd get frustrated with my behaviour so fair enough but yeah I guess I don't miss him so much!\n\nHave gone back to school for a second degree, trying to get something going in health care (!) and am interested in mental health (real interested! What's it like to have mental health, I wonder?!) but cannot see myself having the energy and drive to start up my own practice.\n\nI have moved back with parents, pretty good of them to allow it, Dad has quit drinking and embraced AA and Zen Buddhism which he uses as a ping pong paddle to bat away anyone's problems ... Doesn't have to listen if he can just say 'get out of your head and into your hands!' Omg you could die in this house of cliches, and if I hear that one again once more this week I think I really will blow my head off into my hands. I can't really study well because I am so anxious about failing. And I end up failing. Again and again. I can kid myself for awhile at the beginning of each semester that this time it's different but each semester ends with Fs. \n\nIf you think I'm pathetic, yes, well done, I am. I'm finished with this shit. All the 'comeback stories' in the world fill me only with the urge to walk into the nearest ocean rather than take on all that work to 'get better'. Have been in therapy a looooong ass while. I can sometimes convince myself things are on an upswing and my therapists really seem to like that but it never lasts and the poor therapists have to go back to feeling like they're achieving nothing with me. Oh, I don't want drugs, read the Cochrane review on antidepressants and a bunch of other evidence of them being no better than placebo except worse due to side effects, and have seen friends on them not improve so I JUST CAN'T with the false promise of that dangling carrot. \n\nI can't hang out with others well. I am too envious of what they have built for themselves by this age. I try to be polite and interested in people but I hate myself too much to want to be anyone's friend. The contrast is too painful. I have nothing to offer but a happy facade that is too hard to keep hoisting into position every day. \n\nI am tired. I am done. Women in particular do not fare well after the age of forty when they don't have an established career. I don't think I'm gonna get a Second Act. I can't see finding anyone who would want a relationship with me (Srsly my advice would be run for the hills). I could get things together enough to 'look' like someone who could be in a relationship but I would definitely crash within months.  There will clearly be no children (for the best, little unborn ghost-children!) I will kill myself but will make it look like an accident at least so that's what they can tell my niece happened. I can keep up that appearance and then never have to do it again. My sister is proof that someone with my background (really not all that awful in the scheme of things) can make a good life and she really doesn't want to hear about my problems. Her answers always start with \"Just-\" and then whatever thing I Just. Can't. Do. \n\nThanks for reading.  Don't even need to CMV or anything I just needed to complain about my perfectly average comparatively simple and comfortable life that many people would envy. i just want to push eject and leave. I am allowed to hate my life. \n\nETA a poster kindly left a book recommendation, but has since deleted their post. Thankyou for taking time to read my post and reply so kindly. I am going to check that book out.
