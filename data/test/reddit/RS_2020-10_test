My name's Jacob, I'm 21, and from a city on the Mass\/NH state line near Boston. I'm here because I don't wanna keep settling for short term flings online anymore. I'm a big boy now, and I want a big boy relationship.\n\nA bit about myself as far as GFD is concerned, I've got a sort of interesting origin story. Once upon a time, when I was but a \\[REDACTED\\] year old boy, I started roleplaying on Omegle. As I learned more about myself and what I like, I started to get into more femdom heavy scenarios. The problem was, I don't enjoy; let alone put up with abuse\/degrading. At the time, all I could find were women who wanted to beat, rape, and\/or kill me, sometimes even all three! Needless to say, I was so thrilled by my options as a sub that I forced myself to become a dom, just to avoid women who wanted to hurt me. Many years passed (maybe like 5, I dunno), and while I had a few semi-serious relationships here and there, I was never truly happy with them as I couldn't be myself. Then, on one fateful day, I learned two words that would change me forever: \"Mommy Dom\". It was as if I had found the perfect niche tailor made for me. Dominant women who can be caring and affectionate, while still asserting that they're the boss! Ever since I learned that gentle femdom is a thing, I've been searching high and low for the right woman for me. This may come as a shock to you all, but gentle dommes are far and few in between. This brings us to today, where I've finally decided to sack up and put myself out there on this subreddit!\n\nGenerally speaking, I'm a very cutesy and affectionate sub; definitely lots of little energy. If I'm not getting any attention, I caaaan be a bit bratty at times, but that usually ends after the first headpat. I'm a slut for headpats. While I do enjoy being playful and cute, I'm also completely content being a lap-dog sub, just snuggling up to you while you go about your business. Ideally, I'd like a strong and confident woman (no duh), who isn't afraid to be physically dominant\/take what she wants. That being said, I also don't want to be treated exclusively like a subby toy. I want a REAL relationship with a girl who can separate our GFD dynamic from the relationship as a whole. I'm not sure if that makes any sense, so don't worry if you're confused, I am too!\n\nOf course, there's more to me than just being submissive. I was born and raised an obnoxious Boston sports fan, so I can go on for hours about the B's, C's, Pats, and Sox. If you can talk sports, you've immediately caught my interest. While I never played any team sports in school, I was a hell of a defender in ultimate frisbee before I was injured. I'm extremely white, I know. I also play a lot of video games, though there's no real rhyme or reason as to what I play aside from Nintendo games. I'm a huge LoZ fan, and Twilight Princess is my favorite game of all time. If you've read this, tell me to stay hydrated in a threatening way when you message me. I've also played pokemon since I was 6, and I'm pretty sure that I've spent close to 1,000 hours crossing my animals in New Horizons. Some of my non-Nintendo favorites include Gravity Rush 1&amp;2, Persona 5, Battle for Bikini Bottom, Maplestory 2 (RIP), Blade and Soul, and Hollow Knight. I'm currently living at home, because poor. That being said, I'd like to be living on my own (or with someone ;) ) sooner rather than later. I'm currently working on my Bachelor's degree in Biology at ASU, though I'm doing all of my schooling online. I hope to one day be a zookeeper, and make a positive impact on wildlife that will last long after I'm gone. I have two pets, a 2 year old pitbull named Tawney, and a nearly 3 year old guinea pig named Midna. I've also started to take an interest in reptiles recently, but I don't see myself owning one anywhere in the near future.\n\nAssuming I haven't missed any important details, here are the obligatory lists saying what I am, and what I want:\n\n**ME:**\n\n* 21, 5'9\", blue eyes and dirty blonde hair, broad chest and shoulders that make me look significantly bigger than I actually am, and not to brag, but I've got a pretty nice ass.\n* Charismatic airhead that tries not to take everything too seriously. Not saying I'm some carefree kid, but I also know that the best way to stay sane in today's world is to laugh rather than cry.\n* Looking for a romantic partner first and foremost. While I'm open to making new friends, if you're just looking for a new boy toy to use, please go away. This boy toy wants a relationship.\n* While I enjoy spending time together, I'm also not some clingy teenager. Life happens and life sucks, so I'm not gonna be hounding you 24\/7.\n* Willing to start online, but would like to upgrade to in person when the time is right.\n\n**YOU:**\n\n* Between 18 - 32 (Slightly flexible on the upper range). Physical appearance isn't the biggest thing for me, but I'd also be lying if I said it doesn't matter. I've seen a lot of people say \"height and weight proportionate\" on here, so I'll go with that. I am, however, very into taller girls, so if you're taller than me, I might melt. I like short dommes too, so don't feel like I won't respond cause you're shorter than me.\n* Knows when to relax, and when to board the hype train. Basically, if you're a composed human being, we'll be fine\n* Has at least a few things in common with me. While I'll be open to new ideas and hobbies, if we don't have anything in common other than bedroom preferences, it won't last.\n* Has discord or kik. They're both so much better for messaging than Reddit.\n\nI think that just about does it for me. Hopefully some of you will like what you see! While you can shoot me a message on here if you're interested, I prefer talking on discord, or kik if need be.

It's something I never thought would happen to me (nor does anyone I guess), but here I am.  Years of hardcore porn got me here.  College especially didn't help my case.  I relieved my stress by firing off a round every night to anything my heart desired.  The internet is limitless after all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere I am now with a beautiful and amazing girl who came into my life three months ago.  But because of my addiction, I struggle to get hard with her when we try to do things.  To even have a chance, I forced myself to think about porn to try and get hard.  When she broke down in tears three weeks ago thinking she wasn't good enough, I knew I had to do something.  I had to kick the filth and fetishes I had come accustom to for something real.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSlowly but surely I'm starting to get better.  The first week I completely lost my libido.  I didn't MO or PMO at all.  I decided to stop cold turkey.  As the second week started though, my libido started to come back slowly.  The random erections in the morning started to become more prevalent.  My dick was doing things I hadn't see it do since my teenage years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm now on week three with my libido slowly returning even more.  I'm still struggling with associating real and vanilla sex with arousal, but I'm getting there.  Things are getting better day by day.  It's going to take more time for sure, but I'm trying.  My girlfriend said she'll see me through this thing and isn't going anywhere.  I just wanted to write this to vent and also let you guys know that you're not alone.  This is hard.  This is really, really hard.  But everything we're doing is for the better.  When you have a bad day and want to go back, remember why you started in the first place.  Remember what motivated you to make a change in your life.  I want nothing more than to show this girl how much she means to me and be able to finally have sex with her.  That's my goal, and that's my motivator to be better.  Know that you are not alone, and we will all get through this together.

I have moderate to severe Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. I am 32 and was diagnosed over half a decade ago. I have advancing Geschwind Syndrome; this is going to be a bit long winded. Please, bear with me.\n\nMy seizures are focal or focal-to-bilateral and rarely happen when I'm awake, so I'm a bit fuzzy on their details. I understand almost everything technical about my epilepsy, from having a lesion at the base of my brain causing seizure clusters almost every month to how it takes hours to days for me to come out of my post-ictal state. What I don't understand is the first thing that happens when I have a seizure while conscious is that I lose my ability to speak. I can still kind of communicate, but my vocabulary becomes very limited, to the point where I can say very few words longer than a single syllable. This inability to communicate lasts through my entire post-ictal state and sometimes well into the point I become aware again.\n\nOkay, now, I know that this is referred to as Broca's Aphasia. What I don't understand is that Broca's Area is in the frontal lobe, yet my epilepsy focus is my temporal lobe. Shouldn't I be having Werneke's Aphasia instead due to the focus location? Or Frontal Lobe Epilepsy, since that's where Broca's Area is located? Could this be some form of Mixed Aphasia, as I also lose my ability to comprehend any written word as soon as it starts?\n\nThank you for your time! \ud83d\udc9c","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Epilepsy","subreddit_id":"t5_2s1h9","subreddit_subscribers":20634,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Transient Aphasia Type?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Epilepsy\/comments\/j2y1ct\/transient_aphasia_type\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Enjoy!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart 2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter this scene, Ethel asked Tyriel to get Arisa some breakfast which he agreed. During the short wait, Arisa took a cursory glance at the room where she and Ethel are. The room is quite spacious, more than enough for two people to occupy, plain looking and has a 'practical' vibe into it. On one side of the room that is nearest to where Ethel is, a lot of art materials are cluttered together. Paintbrushes of varying sizes, papers of different types, watercolors, oil-based paint etc. One the same corner too, various sorts, paint cans of different kinds, lots of drawing media were placed in haphazard order, except the gaming consoles that were placed in a decent order. The room, by quick look, is definitely what most people would not call 'girlish', but not 'rough' to be called 'boyish'. A has few minutes passed, Tyriel  returned to the room carrying a plastic bed tray filled with various food items. Cooked rice with steam still emanating from it, a golden-brown boneless fried fish, two perfectly circle sunny side ups, two condiment bowls with soy sauce and ketchup, a cup of coffee with a creamer packet and finally, some freshly cut slices of pears and apples and a glass of water. Arisa's soul was 'imprinted with human various knowledge' due to certain fairy's intervention. As such, Arisa has that 'vague sense' that this things are 'usual foods consumed by humans'. Even so, she couldn't help her drool to be in kept in check and soon her mouth is like a waterfall and her eyes sparkled from the foods displayed in from of her. \"Geez look at you, looking at you like that makes me think for a second your not a gir---ow! What's that for Ethel?!\". Ethel just flicked a small eraser into Tyriel's forehead while drawing something. Her pin-point accuracy without even looking at the target and with such speed as to cause pain towards the targetr is amzaing.  \"Don't say things like that to girl. Sheesh, your looks are wasted on you.\", Ethel said that in an impassive manner. \"What looks? Okay okay I won't do it again\" Tyriel replied while simultaneously handing Arisa the bed tray. \"Suit yourself... Here you go unnamed girl. What's your name anyway? Hey speak to me. Do you understand English? Oi oi oi who are you...ow ow!\". This time, Ethel sniped his forehead with a clip. \"Manners Tea, m-a-n-n-e-r-s\" Ethel spelled that one with some hint of serious intonation. \"Okay okay! Miss, what is your name?\" Tea asked courteously but he seemed forced. Arisa made a low laugh \"It's okay. I'm not used to such courtesy. My name is Arisa. Thanks for having me. Uhmm..., can I really eat all this stuff I mean, I have no money...\"\"Suit yourself Arisa, the one who made that made a little extra for today, no one will eat that anyways.\" Tea urged Arisa to eat, and eat she did. The items on the tray are presentation-wise, above average. But once Arisa took the first bite of that fried fish, her sense of taste was invaded by delight. Crispy on the outside but quite soft on the inside was the fish. The eggs are supple to the lips with a hint of salt infused to them. These two different proteins compliments the rice really well, the same can also be said with the condiments. Audible \\*munch munch munch\\* sounds can be heard in the room, Arisa is clearly and utturely famished that she didn't care about the eating noises she is currently making. Tyriel tried to make a comment about it, but words never left his mouth as Ethel look at him with dead eyes. 'Be silent' can be traced on Ethel's lip movements, like how someone could guess words uttered by a muted tv . Arisa swallowed the meal offered to her in large chunks, her devouring process punctuated with some water to prevent her from choking herself. All in all, she finished the meal in just a few minutes and that included the fruits. Arisa then proceeded to make an un-girlish burp. Ethel smiled while Tyriel commented nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"So why did you come here in Patswan village?\", Tyriel asked Arisa while she gingerly took small sips of warm coffee. \"Well, I came here to mingle...I mean visit this place as this is a famous destination for people to go. This is bitter...\" Arisa was slightly repulsed by the bitter taste of the coffee, so she added some creamer to the cup. \"Yeah, understandable, a lot of people frequent this place to unwind and relax.\" Ethel was done with what she's workingon her desk and is now conversing to Arisa normally. If they would ask other things like the place of origin and other personal things, Arisa will say to them that with honesty. Even though she lied last night, Arisa couldn't bear the idea of lying to Ethel and Tyriel the second time around. After all, they saved her, gave her a place to stay and breakfast. \"So, you went here all by yourself?\" Tyriel asked while pulling his smartphone out on one his pocket. \"Dang I'll be late for the band practice. Ethel, you don't have anywhere to go today right? I'll leave the house to you. Practice til night, tell him I won't be here for supper.\"\"Okay. But he may get mad at you if don't come here before 10pm. Remember last time when your bf gave you an hour long sermon because you came here past twelve midnight?\", Ethel reminded. \"I know I know. But his not my mom. Besides I'm 18! Don't confuse Arisa with that vague acronym! I'll be going, see ya!\" Tyriel bolted towards the door and went downstairs afterwards. Ethel closed the door gently until it gave satisfying click. Arisa has now half-emptied the now lukewarm cup of coffee and Ethel returned to her seat. \"That guy looks and acts like a delinquent but inside he's a nice person\" Ethel said that with a sigh. \"Yeah. I mean the way you casually flickered things to his forehead wwww\" Arisa smiled and giggled a little. \"I haven't inroduced myself properly to you. My name is Ethel, 20 years old and currently a student here at Patswan. Nice to meet you.\" Ethel offered her right hand towards Arisa. \"Ah ah ah. Nice to meet you too! My name is Arisa! Thank you for helping me! I'm in great debt of you!!\" Arisa hurriedly reached for Ethel's hand and shook it frantically. Arisa attempted to also bow to show her depth of gratitude but Ethel said that a handshake would suffice. \"So, do you have anywhere to stay here in Patswan?\" Ethel inquired Arisa, \"Uhmm I haven't thought about that at all.\" What Arisa said was absolutely true: since she has no plan of sorts when going here and her ever-unreliable fairy chucked her out of the forest, a vague answer is all that she could muster. Now she realized it, she scolded herself for not having any plans at all. What an easy go lucky bunny.  \"Is that so? In any case, would you like to stay here with us for a while?\" Ethel's reply was a request to Arisa. Though it seemed that Ethel said that with a light tone, her eyes says otherwise. Arisa could feel that those eyes give off sincere intent,as to why is that, Arisa needed to ask Ethel. \"Thank you very much for that offer after all, it will benefit me. But if may ask, why are you easily willing to let me stay here even though I'm quite a stranger to you and Tyriel?\". \"Well, that's uhmm, how can I say this....Ah.. I feel you have a very good heart. I cannot explain it very well. I just feel it. Haha, this is awkward. And besides...\". She looked above the ceiling with her left index finger pressing to her temple. \"I want to have girl friend here on thehouse. I mean, there is girl living here, but she rarely comes home. Having two boys here and one girl is bad for the heart, I guess? Come on, what do you say?\" Ethel said those words without much of a vocal intensity, but her eyes and firm facial features speaks volume to Arisa. \"If you think the others won't approve, don't worry. Fish and Tea will definitely agree with me. They are quite compliant with my requests.\" To that, Ethel grinned to Arisa. Unable to make a rebuttal because, why would Arisa do that? It's a win-win scenario. \"Thanks for your offer Ethel. I promise I won't be a burden!\" Arisa said that with conviction. \"Welcome Arisa!\" Ethel said, beaming with a smile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnd of Part 2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKonnichiwa!

I am 54, Caucasian, male, 180 lbs., 5'6.5\", non-smoker and non-drinker, and for the most part in at least fair health.  I now can be somewhat more particular about what my physician discovered earlier today. I generally was comfortable with this younger Dr. that I was assigned to for this appointment; he seemed knowledgeable and caring and understood my insecurities.  And this GP, like others, did not make the situation to be an emergency requiring quick attention.  The matter involves bright red bleeding per rectum.\n\nThere were no external hemorrhoids discovered during a visual check.  However, the doctor performed a quick DRE and noticed some sort of mass near the opening.  It is suspected by him that the bleeding comes from there, and it could be resultant from straining, etc.  Eventually, I am to schedule an appointment at a local gastroenterology center for further examination.  Instead of a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, this is the anoscopy procedure.  And I have been prescribed some medications including suppositories and 1-2 laxative agents.  I will be seen by him again in about 3 1\/4 months.\n\nMy question remains thus: Because this pattern of some rectal bleeding has been ongoing for the better part of the past 10 years despite my not feeling really any worse in my overall strength and stamina, is it more likely that it is a \"stubborn\" internal tissue or cyst that has built up some mass\/hardness? Would a malignant tumor likely by now have caused some serious malaise and loss of strength\/stamina by now, and is it more more probable that such a growth could result in greater obstruction\/become larger over such a time frame? I don't notice any real change in habits, consistency, or patterns.  He showed me 1-2 pictures of what an internal hemorrhoid might look like.  It appears to be more tough and firm in at least one image.  Would a tumor\/polyp have a feel that is more readily distinguishable? Also, if I do not have external hems, what might cause some soreness in that area when I am sitting down for longer periods on chairs even with some padding? What might be the purpose of the anoscopy approach instead of one of the more involved tools?\n\nThanks for responses now\/to my earlier post, and I'll add further updates with care as warranted and may if discovering anything amiss here make some minor changes.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskDocs","subreddit_id":"t5_2xtuc","subreddit_subscribers":310548,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Findings at medical consultation","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskDocs\/comments\/j2ya3w\/findings_at_medical_consultation\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I got my CS degree in December of 2018, I'm 38, and I have three other degrees in music. \n\nI have been sort of dangled around with the promise that I could move away from testing and into development. It's been kind of a, \"as soon as this software is released, you'll get some dev responsibility.\" \n\nThis has come from both my director of engineering and the CEO. \n\nBut yesterday we released the software that we've been busting our asses over for most of the year. I have mainly been working in Excel in order to manage the testing. I really feel like my position has been more about management and paperwork because I've had to write the test plans, organize interns and others for testing, and then perform black box testing of our software. \n\nI have had a few projects here and there where I've been able to write code in C, C++, Python, and Bash scripting, and our new software has a lua plugin system that I've had to write a lot of scripts for. But most have been one off projects that haven't been able to really be explored and developed long term.\n\nYesterday, I flat out asked my best friend in the department, and one of our senior engineers who has been with the company nearly twenty years if I should be thinking of a different company to advance my career. He told me, \"I don't want to encourage anyone who is intelligent and skilled to leave the company, but if your goal is to advance as a developer, I think you're probably going to have to.\"\n\nSo this is contrary to what I have been told for a while. At this point, I'm worried that my reginal l technical skills are rusting and I'm going to have issues with that. Compound that with the pandemic and the fact that my medical history puts me at significantly higher risk them most that I am instructed to stay home stay healthy until we enter phase four. I am able to work from home in this position, and I need to start figuring out my exit strategy. \n\nAs a thought, I decided to buy Colt Steele's Web Development Udemy course (even though I wasn't quite as interested in web development when I was in school, I did fine getting an A in the class) and brushing up on all that. I'm thinking that maybe I can do freelance work on the side while I ride through the pandemic. \n\nWhat do you think? Does this seem like a dumb idea? Can I be doing something else?

I believe it started when I was 18 and I'm 25 now, my ex therapist says it probably started when I was 13 but It doesnt matter when it began. \n\nThese past 2 months have been the hardest and the last 2 days even worse. My mother was diagnosed once more with cancer, the same thing she had over a decade ago. The news has been tough but it is what it is. One Tuesday we got into a stupid argument over nothing, just a stupid wire. Without talking it out with me or even trying to sort it out she left the house. Now she knows the dangers in our current climate, coronavirus, if she gets that it all over. \n\nMy brother has special needs and relies heavily on the support network that me and her provide but the fact that she could haphazardly risk her life out of anger hurt me deeply. So... I left before she could return. \n\nI dont know why, I just did, I dont even know where I was going, I had so many thoughts rushing though my head I just reacted. Next thing i knew i was at a local suicide spot, I walked 2 hours just to get there and when I was there I looked over the edge and broke down crying. It took all my strength to walk away, to make another promise to myself I'm properly to much of a coward to follow though with. \n\nWhen I returned home I was greeted to a chain locked door, if it wasnt for my brother i wouldnt of had a place to stay nor would i of wanted one, probablyjust curled up outside. I walked in the house and went straight to my room and locked my door as I needed to be alone. I was then met with insults and threats from the otherside of the wall. Personal stuff was broken on the floor, the wire cut as if a statement was made. \n\nIt's now been over 24 hours, the door remains locked, I've done nothing but lie in bed and stare at my loaded crossbow wondering if I made the right choice in walking away. \n\nI havent spoken to any of my friends, my family or anyone about this as I've never been good at talking about my emotions. I've never wrote anything down before about my emotions either, this is my first attempt. I wrote it here because in truth I'm scared. I see no future for myself, I just dont see the point, I havent in a long while. \n\nI'm sorry, I just needed a place to type.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"depression","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqqf","subreddit_subscribers":763259,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I just need a place to get all my thoughts down","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.99,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/depression\/comments\/j2ykbq\/i_just_need_a_place_to_get_all_my_thoughts_down\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I wanted as much advice as possible, from as many different people, so I can understand as many viewpoints on the matter as possible, and this subreddit seemed like a good fit. So, anyway, I should probably begin.....\n\nI'm a 16 year old, who's been trying to figure out where I would belong in the creative industry for a while. My interest actually began back when I was 12, but it took a few years to know what I really want, and what I'm good at. And even now, I'm still not entirely sure how I would move forward.....actually, I'm not sure at all.\n\nWhat I do know is this.....I really, really enjoy creating, writing, and presenting stories. I like to come up with the characters and the plots, write them myself, and hopefully, present them. I also really enjoy the artistic process of storytelling. I like drawing out my characters and the worlds. I'd like to consider myself a pretty good artist, and I've been moving forward with animation recently.\n\nFor a few years, I've been trying to create short animated stories so that I can have something to show for my skill. Unfortunately, due to my own foolishness and incompetence, I squandered years of opportunity and have nothing to show for it. But at least I've finally got my ambition in check, and started a project I'm determined to complete, so at least things are finally working out.\n\nNow, sorry about the long intro and all, but I thought it was important to get that out of the way, so you get where I'm at right now. Now, the issue at hand is that in two years, I'm heading off to college, and I have no idea what degree or major I should be looking for. Now, I should probably explain what I'm looking for in a professional position.  \n\nI'm not set in one specific position, as I've been interested in different skills. But what I'm interested in the most is being the one to actually come up with or write a story\/script, or be the director of one, or be the artistic designer, or in some way be involved within these skills. I know obviously I won't start out in a lead position, I'm okay with a lower position, but the point is, is that these are the kind of things that interest me. Scriptwriting, directing, art design, animation, I'll take whatever I can get. \n\nI should also specify that I'm not limiting my ambition to only the film industry. The game industry is one that would also put my skill to good use, and allow me to tell and design stories. Both mediums are options I'm considering. \n\nBut the problem is I have no idea what degree I'd need to actually get there. And I know that a lot of people believe you don't need a degree, you just need a reel of presentable work to prove your skills make you worth the job. But realistically, the need for a degree has become pretty blatant at this point, and I don't know if I can afford to be without one. I mean, I can't just walk out of high school once I'm 18, and hand over a screenplay of mine to a producer, or start working at some indie studio right away. In the end, it looks like some qualification is necessary. \n\nMaybe this is my fault for wanting to achieve multiple skills at once, but I can't think of any degrees that would fit what I need. If I had to prioritize one skill, it would be actually writing the screenplay, and coming up with a story. \n\nI've been thinking that since I actually want to be in charge of developing creative projects, maybe I should also look for a degree within project management, or something of that sort. But I'm not sure if a degree like that means much in the creative industry.\n\nHonestly, I've got absolutely no idea what I should be looking for. Sorry for the long post, but my thoughts are all over the place, and I'm really in need of some good advice. So, if anyone thinks they know what to recommend for me, I'd really appreciate it.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to ask this kind of question, but honestly, I couldn&amp;#39;t think of any other subreddit that fit the topic, and would actually bring enough attention to my post. I wanted as much advice as possible, from as many different people, so I can understand as many viewpoints on the matter as possible, and this subreddit seemed like a good fit. So, anyway, I should probably begin.....&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 16 year old, who&amp;#39;s been trying to figure out where I would belong in the creative industry for a while. My interest actually began back when I was 12, but it took a few years to know what I really want, and what I&amp;#39;m good at. And even now, I&amp;#39;m still not entirely sure how I would move forward.....actually, I&amp;#39;m not sure at all.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I do know is this.....I really, really enjoy creating, writing, and presenting stories. I like to come up with the characters and the plots, write them myself, and hopefully, present them. I also really enjoy the artistic process of storytelling. I like drawing out my characters and the worlds. I&amp;#39;d like to consider myself a pretty good artist, and I&amp;#39;ve been moving forward with animation recently.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a few years, I&amp;#39;ve been trying to create short animated stories so that I can have something to show for my skill. Unfortunately, due to my own foolishness and incompetence, I squandered years of opportunity and have nothing to show for it. But at least I&amp;#39;ve finally got my ambition in check, and started a project I&amp;#39;m determined to complete, so at least things are finally working out.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, sorry about the long intro and all, but I thought it was important to get that out of the way, so you get where I&amp;#39;m at right now. Now, the issue at hand is that in two years, I&amp;#39;m heading off to college, and I have no idea what degree or major I should be looking for. Now, I should probably explain what I&amp;#39;m looking for in a professional position.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not set in one specific position, as I&amp;#39;ve been interested in different skills.

I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder when I was a teenager. I've always felt like there was something more than just an anxiety disorder, I've had occasional \"fits\" of rage since I was a young child, always directed at family member or SO's. I've struggled with drug addiction, I'm irresponsible with money, and have a past of participating in unsafe sex. \n\nMy past relationships have been very unstable and abusive, I often lose control of my emotions if I feel like an SO might leave me. Even if they tell me they just want to leave to cool down and think after a fight I just completely lose it. The reason I started looking into BPD is because of the quote (I believe it's a book title), \"I hate you, don't leave me\", I've felt that so many times. \n\nI am constantly going through phases of loving my friends or SO so much, thinking their the best person in the world, to not being able to stand being near them. I get extremely depressed seemingly out of nowhere, and am completely fine sometimes just a few minutes later. \n\nMy interests\/hobbies\/appearance\/whole entire personality changes so much, I've always struggled so, so much with feeling like I don't really have my own personality. I just really resonate with most of the symptoms, but it feels wrong to say I have BPD.\n\n I feel like I shouldn't be in these spaces specifically for people with BPD, because no matter how strongly I feel that I have it, I'm not diagnosed. I feel alone and unsupported. I'm afraid that if I *do* get a diagnosis people will look at me differently, or I'll fall deeper into a pattern of toxic behavior. \n\nThis is getting long and I'm not really sure where I'm going with this. I guess I just want to know if I should be here, or if there are any spaces for people who strongly suspect they have BPD but don't have a diagnosis? If you made it this far, thanks for reading my word-vomit.

Just some background: I'm 18, male, in university, American, and come from a (very) practicing Pakistani family. \n\nAlhamdullilah I pray 5 times a day and do my best to stay within my boundaries (unless you're amongst those who believe drawing cartoons, watching tv, and listening to music is sinful... but I would appreciate it if we could not have an argument about that). But my heart is almost always very conflicted. I feel like Islam is the boundaries and practices I set for myself, but the way I think about other people and the world as a whole is very liberal, probably quite a bit more than many of you guys would deem appropriate. And I notice the language I use and the morals I draw upon differ greatly depending on if I'm in secular circles or Muslim ones. I feel like I lead a double life, and if I'm to be honest I don't participate of my own accord in Muslim communities beyond what my parents drag me along to. \n\nI guess it's easy to say I shouldn't be ashamed of my faith, but it's not as simple as that. There are things in the Shari'a like penal\/punitive law, women's rights, treatment of homosexuals, fate of people of other religions, etc. that I personally struggle to reconcile. That along with the issue of sectarianism and institutionalization (Sunni, Shi'a, maddhabs, scholarly disagreement, compilation of hadith, etc.) sometimes makes me question the divinity of Islam, or at least Islam as it is practiced in this modern era. There are more things that bother me and also get a lot more existential than that, but I'd prefer to privately discuss those kinds of things with a sympathetic scholar. \n\nI know people get told that you should just make du'a, read more Quran, the evil influence of the west is getting to you, etc. Unfortunately none of that is particularly constructive in my case. If you can help it please do not list the immaturity of someone my age as a reason for why I just can't understand. I have no desire to party, have sex outside of marriage, do drugs, do whatever I want. I just can't blindly follow Islam as much as I would like to, and I need to understand the truth.\n\nDoes anyone know of any counseling resources, shuyukh I can reach out to, etc. that know how to deal with things like this? Someone who is willing to be empathetic, isn't dismissive of my concerns, wouldn't say things like stop being insolent, you shouldn't question these things, etc. I feel like most people who are knowledgeable enough to help me are too busy or would charge me money I don't have (but the latter is more manageable). I would love to sit down and talk to someone like Dr. Shabir Ally or other scholars who deal more with interfaith\/debate things, but I understand that it's not fair for me to expect individual attention from them. I feel stuck, scared, and alone. It was terrifying enough articulating my thoughts aloud like this as I guess they can be read in a way that is blasphemous. That's not my intention I just have questions and need help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJazakallah khair","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"islam","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhbp","subreddit_subscribers":160336,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Doubting the faith","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/islam\/comments\/j2z13v\/doubting_the_faith\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

to the gilded halls of **THE TRANSFORMATION LIBRARY!** within our one and only location accessible through one of the many doorways stationed all over the world. In this wondrous location we hold knowledge of many kinds of transformations. We gather information from every corner of every universe relating to transformation and its many facets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrowse through the tales of transformation section located on the third floor of our ever-expanding library. Search for images, and comics and gifs located within the image gallery or comic gallery located in the east wing. Search through our computers for gifs comics and other images not on display at the moment as well! Browse through information on various, species, items, worlds, and effects that relate to the wonderful art of transformation as well!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs well we sometimes like to give short lectures and explanations of various different things. these explanations could relate to things such as: Races, Magic, Items, Worlds, and Societies. All of these things focused around the wonderful art of transformation! These lectures are to inspire minds and help others explore the many options of the wonderful art known as transformation\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday we will be discussing:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE AMULET OF THE GOD EMPRESS--**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday we will be going over the item known as the amulet of the god empress, the ritual used to create it, and the effects of it, and the powers it grants the one it chooses as a host! All of this information will be detailed below\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, we should go over what this mystic item even is. ***The amulet of the god empress*** or as it is more commonly known the pendent of power is well known through history. Every now and again it would be made and an extremely powerful queen would rise to power soon after wielding strange powers. The details of how to create this pendent can be found within a book known as ***the book of stars*** an ancient book of magic with only one known copy. It holds the necessary ingredients, and incantations to create ***the amulet of the god empress***. The amulet grants the wearer the ability to change others in any way they would so desire. This could be forcing a man to become something like a loyal guardian totally dedicated to the queen or even forcing someone to become a new outfit on a whim. As well it grants near total mastery over the mystical arts to whoever holds it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the amulet has appeared in the past its holder was heralded as a goddess, one who should rule the world. However, the cases of it being properly made are an extreme rarity, when they did show up it was assumed that a woman created the amulet seeking out power and control however this is untrue in many cases. There is one thing about the ritual that is unknown that being that the one who performs the ritual dose not get to wear the item or even bask in its power for instead they are shaped into the amulet itself. When done it leaves the amulet a necklace of obsidian black metal with a glowing crimson red gem alone before it vanishes and appears on what it considers a proper host.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe amulet is not picky when it is selecting its host: It can appear on practically anyone, male female, old, young it will choose what it deems as a proper host and appear around their neck. When the amulet is around someone\u2019s neck it cannot be removed by any means and shall protect the one wearing it against attacks until their changes are done. Speaking of changes the first thing to change is the area around the host. It will warp reality changing a simple house to a lavish mansion with expansive grounds, a broken down or old car into a luxury vehicle! Should they be away from home the area around them shall be warped and shaped into their home and no one shall be the wiser as it warps reality to make it fit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext to change is anyone near the host, specifically the amulet changes anyone within a fifty-foot radius. The changes that those nearby suffer are rather simple: *should any of those within the radius not be female they will have their gender changed becoming female. Next their new female form will begin to grow fur as their body is changed once more, obtaining the form of an anthropomorphic animal. In general, the amulet will change those effected into some kind of big cat such as a lion, tiger, leopard, or jaguar although this is not guaranteed as other types of animals could be chosen! It will then grant them a weapon garbing their new bodies in black and red armor as it warps them so that they become totally loyal and obedient to their new empress while maintaining their own memories and gaining necessary training becoming absolutely loyal guards made to protect their empress.* Should no one else be around this will not happen however additional things can occur during this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen all of that is done the host will begin to change. There are very few linkages between the appearances of those that have worn the amulet the only similarities that can be drawn are that they are **extremely beautiful** and have red eyes. Those two traits are never missing from their form, as well should the host be male, they will obtain a female form. When all physical changes are complete mental changes will settle in, their mind warped and changed becoming extremely dominant and gaining a want and need to conquer and expand their empire. As well the amulet grants them immense knowledge of magic and strategy practically writing over the old personality with this dominant conquering personality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith what happens when the ritual is performed out of the way we should move onto the ritual that is listed within the book of the moon it goes as such: *The one wishing to make the amulet of the god empress must draw a five pointed star out of black iron sand before encircling this star with white iron sand. Next, they must allow a single drop of blood to fall in each gap of the star and circle while reciting the ritual within the book.* But as we all know the one who makes the amulet dose not even get to wear it let alone use its amazing powers as they are formed into the artifact before vanishing and appearing on a host! Unfortunately, in all of our research and study we have only managed to uncover the ritual used and not the incantation needed to create the amulet of the god empress. As for whatever happens after the amulet is created, well we won\u2019t know until it is created again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you I hope you enjoyed this explanation of the amulet of the god empress and I hope it has sparked some form of inspiration within at least one of you and I do so hope that we will see you during our next explanation on the wonders of transformation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHello their fair reader \\^ - \\^ I hope you enjoyed this. These are made with the idea of giving inspiration for roleplay-based ideas as I am getting kind of desperate to do something! So some things can be changed altered and the like so don\u2019t worry it can be changed here and there below I am going to link a few things 1 is a panel from the comic this is based off cause I like the image. The second is the entire comic, and the third are my rules. one thing i must say is that i do not own any of the art used here\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do have a few rules we should go over! dont worry they are simple!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1:** This rule is less of a rule more a request, **please be detailed!** i like things detailed it makes things more fun i think and changes that happen slowly are much more fun than ones that pass by quickly!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2: If you are changing I am changing.** Simple right? Plots where only you change will not be accepted by me as i love being changed and for me that is like 90% of the fun the other 10% being writing things up!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3: No plot is set in stone.** None of my plots are entirely set in stone from their moment of conception things are made flexible and we can just have as much fun as we want change this make that a bit different its all fine!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4: I will describe changes that happen to you, and you describe changes that happen to me!** seems simple right, i hope so its only fair that if i describe you changing you give me the same courtesy. Now then i will sometimes leave some things up to you especially when we dont discus things in detail i might leave hair color or the exact size of your breasts up to you but ill handle the descriptions of your body changing! i just expect the same back!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5: Say something interesting when you message!** Please dont just send me a \"hey\" it dose not make me confident the roleplay will go anywhere fast or anywhere at all! Sorry if this turns you off i just find its nice to get to know someone even a little bit before you rp with them! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6:** as immature as it is when you message say \"by the moon i will gain big bouncy boobies\" just so i know you actual ready this far!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cover image hehe](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/u0S2j8H)\n\n[Comic this is based on](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/tCpBFhM)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for what we can do there are many stories that can be performed with this ranging from simple to rather complicated slow to fast lewd to fun we dont have to tie ourselves down a ton with this. In fact I have an idea for what we could do with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you have enjoyed this post! If you message me we are going to have just so much fun together! other ideas can be talked about discussed and made into nice plots for us to run through! I have a couple other ideas besides this one but they are kinda stuck in my head at the moment! I love all kinds of transformations and while I like some more than others there are very few kinds I am totally opposed to. \n\n\n\n\n\nAny and all characters in this roleplay will be over the age of 18. I am 21. There are no exceptions to this rule.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading this and from me to you LETS RP SOON KAY\\~\n\n\nKik\u2010 Etresta","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DirtyKIKRoleplay","subreddit_id":"t5_3kem5","subreddit_subscribers":39612,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[a4A]THE TRANAFORMATION LIBRARY: THE AMULET OF THE GOD EMPRESS~","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DirtyKIKRoleplay\/comments\/j2z2od\/a4athe_tranaformation_library_the_amulet_of_the\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

For years I've been questioning is this the universe I was born into? \nI've been feeling like I'm forgetting someone. Now and again I can hear faint whispers of a woman asking me to please remember her. And when I ask family if they know anything I get ignored. Or they change the subject. \nRecently my memory has been questioned. I'm being told I only want to remember the happy things and rewrite the bad into happy. I called bullshit. Why would I keep then all the miserable memories. Like finding out the woman I loved and had me build a nursery, ... She lied to me about a miscarriage. She got an abortion because I apparently loved the baby more than I did her. That broke me. My mom told me I ran from that good woman. That I must of gotten it from some.cheap soap opera. That I cheated on that poor woman. How could I? I didn't drive while I lived at her families ranch. I'm used to city driving. Not the crazy texas small town driving. her dad always had his eyes on me. I wasn't even alone when I took a poo. But that didn't matter because I was with her. But then she did the abortion. I fell into a depression and left her. When I remember back to it, my soul cries. I wanted my child. I couldn't protect them from their mom. If all I want to remember is happy things why do I hold onto such pain. \nI talked to a dear friend about a watch she got me a decade ago. She had it engraved with the name she called me. Only she calls me this name. She swears on her father's soul (he's dead) that she never got it for me. \nTo the present questioning. My sister told me what our father told her was his life. He's was born in mexico. After that what she knows is vastly different from what I know. Apparently he's been I the states since he was 11. Living with his aunt in texas. That he and my mom met in college when she was taking college courses in high School. \nMy mom told me they first met when he was on a date with her aunt when she was 21. Before that they never met. This would be 1977. They eventually become a couple marrying in 1979. January. I'd be borne in December that year. And my dad would start college that year also. I am 40. At present. She is 64. The numbers as at present. My dad recently died. At the age of 68 and 6 days. \nMy mom currently agrees with my sisters account of history. That mine is all bullshit. But it's what I've known my entire life. I remember as a toddler my dad coming home from school in a snow storm. Scared me and my brother because we never saw him in a ski mask. We thought he was a killer. So we hit him with a broom and hammer. Mom says that never happened. My brother says he doesn't care to anger our mom.\nSo I know I can't be the only one who's encountered such times time to time. Or that memory is that shitty. \nAny thoughts? Insight... Advice? Cause I don't know how to move forward when all the ground I've covered is being questioned.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ParanormalEncounters","subreddit_id":"t5_2zd61","subreddit_subscribers":57054,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Is this where I came from","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.67,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ParanormalEncounters\/comments\/j2z3s8\/is_this_where_i_came_from\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

It's just MY experience and I'm obligated to share it becuase it can potentially help someone in need.\n\n I'm 27yo male and have had PTSD since early childhood (aprox. 5-7 years old). I exercise 4-6 days a week (includes primary 3 muscle groups), primarily eat whole foods diet, and mostly keep a consistent schedule. Never had major symptoms of low T, have already conceived a child so no issues there. I've learned how to cope well since I've nearly had it my whole life, however I would crash and crash hard periodically throughout the years. Some crashes would be so severe it would dismantle and disintegrate my life, relationships, school, career and so on. My coping skills are great and all but it's essentially always been a never ending battle, hence the crashes. So, my recent crash, I got a 31 panel blood test done and my blood work came back all with in ranges. I did some reading and noticed testosterone wasn't tested. The correlations between testosterone, cortisol, serotonin, dopamine, sleep, brain fog, memory, concentration, motivation and so on seemed too significant, so I ordered my own personal testosterone test. My first test was 227ng\/dl (Test was taken at 6:30 am as instructed). I was shocked considering my dad at 50 years old had testosterone level of 400. So i decided to go to a clinic. I did 2 more test. #2- 270ng\/dl, #3- 60ng\/dl. The day of my last test (60ng\/dl) I started trt (testosterone replacement therapy). Now I should emphasize that I, relatively, felt the same at 227\/270\/60 as I have my whole life, as a teen and a child. Despite that, about 10 minutes after the testosterone shot I started to feel more amazing then I ever have in my entire life. Anxiety evaporated, irritability left me, someone cut me off on the highway and I smiled, unprecedented mental clarity, energy surged through me like I had been starving my whole life. I actually get good sleep now, my appetite is consistent, no more acid reflux, no more anxiety, my body physically feels better, happier, calmer, real energy levels without sugar, caffeine or nicotine. My fiance agrees, she loves the posotive changes. I expected the feeling to fade thinking it was some wishful thinking or lucky coincidence, but it persisted. Honestly, I was so overwhelmed that over the next several days I would nearly cry tears of joy on multiple occasions. It's still early. On my third week now, still waking up every day feeling like a million bucks, and starting to be convinced that this (hormone therapy) could be a key component in battling trauma, mental illness and be a key to mens wellness! At least it is for me! Should also add my brother in law has similar issues but is 26. He said \"what the hell\", decided to get tested today and his test came back at 280ng\/dl. \n\n\nAnyone else have similar experiences or anything?\n\nP.S.- I'll try to keep updates on how I'm progressing for those interested.

Just some background: I'm 18, male, in university, American, and come from a (very) practicing Pakistani family.\n\nAlhamdullilah I pray 5 times a day and do my best to stay within my boundaries (unless you're amongst those who believe drawing cartoons, watching tv, and listening to music is sinful... but I would appreciate it if we could not have an argument about that). But my heart is almost always very conflicted. I feel like Islam is the boundaries and practices I set for myself, but the way I think about other people and the world as a whole is very liberal, probably quite a bit more than many of you guys would deem appropriate. And I notice the language I use and the morals I draw upon differ greatly depending on if I'm in secular circles or Muslim ones. I feel like I lead a double life, and if I'm to be honest I don't participate of my own accord in Muslim communities beyond what my parents drag me along to.\n\nI guess it's easy to say I shouldn't be ashamed of my faith, but it's not as simple as that. There are things in the Shari'a like penal\/punitive law, women's rights, treatment of homosexuals, fate of people of other religions, etc. that I personally struggle to reconcile. That along with the issue of sectarianism and institutionalization (Sunni, Shi'a, maddhabs, scholarly disagreement, compilation of hadith, etc.) sometimes makes me question the divinity of Islam, or at least Islam as it is practiced in this modern era. There are more things that bother me and also get a lot more existential than that, but I'd prefer to privately discuss those kinds of things with a sympathetic scholar.\n\nI know people get told that you should just make du'a, read more Quran, the evil influence of the west is getting to you, etc. Unfortunately none of that is particularly constructive in my case. If you can help it please do not list the immaturity of someone my age as a reason for why I just can't understand. I have no desire to party, have sex outside of marriage, do drugs, do whatever I want. I just can't blindly follow Islam as much as I would like to, and I need to understand the truth.\n\nDoes anyone know of any counseling resources, shuyukh I can reach out to, etc. that know how to deal with things like this? Someone who is willing to be empathetic, isn't dismissive of my concerns, wouldn't say things like stop being insolent, you shouldn't question these things, etc. I feel like most people who are knowledgeable enough to help me are too busy or would charge me money I don't have (but the latter is more manageable). I would love to sit down and talk to someone like Dr. Shabir Ally or other scholars who deal more with interfaith\/debate things, but I understand that it's not fair for me to expect individual attention from them.

It will be a long post so please bear with me. Throwaway account because people I know IRL know my normal account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo. The whole covid thing changed a lot of things in everyone's life. But this year has been a shitshow for me waaaaay beyond that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA bit of exposition first:\n\nI'm a 25 year old guy from germany who is in an apprenticeship as a system administrator. It's my second apprenticeship and in between the two, I went back to school for 3 years. \n\nMy gf and I moved together in june, previously we lived with our respective parents.\n\nIn my free time, I go to goth discos, clubs, comic conventions and meet with friends for boardgames and pen and paper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo. First up: because of covid, in germany each and every disco, club and convention is closed. Since the government wants to support every branch of work, except for gastronomy, they have 0% of income, 0% of government aid, but 100% of bills to pay, which is why most of the clubs I frequent have to close down forever, meaning that there will be many people I like who I will see only rarely in the future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy game group has a few people with asthma and other illnesses in it. That is why we decided to skip it until a vaccine is ready. I really miss them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy gf of 5 years and I moved together in june, into a big apartment. We were so happy and looked forward to our future together. ...for about 2 weeks. It all went downhill from there. We knew we are very different people but only after moving together, we noticed that we are just TOO different. In august, we mutually decided to end the relationship as long as we are still on good terms with each other. She moved out 3 weeks ago. Before that, I spent 3 weeks with my parents because they are closer to the apartment than her parents and I wanted to give her time to properly move out without us still living together for the remaining time, as that would have only resulted in fighting. \n\nSo now I am all alone in this 88 square meter apartment, with noone to greet me when I get back home. Noone except for the memories of this short time we spent together here.\n\nI don't want to move out though. The owner is a friend of the family so I got this place way cheaper than usual. Even an apartment half the size would usually cost more in my area. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you may imagine, an apprenticeship isn't exactly paid well. I get 650\u20ac\/month, 450 of which go down for rent. 50\u20ac go for other regular costs like electricity, wifi etc. It was fine when my gf and I shared the bills but now it's only possible because my parents give me some extra money each month...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, at least it's just for one year. My employer promised to keep me after the end of the apprenticeship. Then I'll get good money.\n\n... or so I thought. Yesterday, I had a meeting with my supervisor who told me that due to covid and the economic impact it has, the company can't keep me after the apprenticeship ends. I need to look for a new employer now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo within just 9 months I have:\n\n\\- lost most of my social contacts\n\n\\- lost my girlfriend\n\n\\- lost my planned employment future\n\n\\- changed my living and financial situation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt just feels like I was not myself any more.\n\nLike I was somehow warped and now live the life of a total stranger.\n\nI miss my girlfriend. Every time I enter my apartment, I see the living room through the glass door, and I see the couch where she has always been reading or doing crossword Puzzles when I come home, and greeted me with a warm smile and a \"welcome home, honey\". Every time I lay in my bed, I imagine her laying there next to me. Sometimes I even think I'd hear her breathe. We have been together for 5 years and when we finally made the step to live together it all broke apart within two months.\n\nI lost my future at the company I work for. I need to find a new employer within the next 6 months. Not impossible at all, but combined with my financial situation and the fact that I am 25 and will just now finish the apprenticeship with zero experience beyond that, I can't help but worry about \"what if I don't find a job?\". I don't want to leech off of my parents any more than absolutely necessary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just don't know what to do or how to deal with it. And my friends who would at least distract me a bit are so distant right now...\n\nI am going crazy and I don't know how to process it all.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"offmychest","subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","subreddit_subscribers":2512471,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My life has been completely turned upside down and I don't know how to deal with it","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/offmychest\/comments\/j2zih8\/my_life_has_been_completely_turned_upside_down\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I looked up at your face, with your lips smirking at me and your eyes giving me a look that told me the fight was over, you had won again and that i should just accept the loss - all so you could take a pounding from yours truly. i guess it only made sense that the one who introduced me to sex fighting would also be my fuck buddy, who was also a total bottom that liked a thick cock inside of his young tight ass when class was over. However, i wasn't about to give you the satisfaction of beating me again. Even if you were my fighting partner, i was still a top and i was committed to dominating your ass in a fight just as much as i do during sex. I knew i had to make my move - and it had to be now.*\n\nHey there. I'm looking for a young \\[around 21 - 30 years old\\] partner to play as my fighting partner and fuck buddy. The rp is based around this but can easily branch out into other fun scenarios. \n\nA little about myself; my name is Josh, I'm 21 years old and a top. I always top and never bottom so keep that in mind. I'm looking for a confident, commanding partner that is also young and lively to help set the mood. I find bottoms who have those kind of personality traits to be the best kind so if you're anything like that then you're already in my good books lol. That means I'm not into rping with timid, shy or overly submissive partners, it's just not my thing and doesn't excite me. You also don't need to know anything about sex fighting to do this, it's all just kinky fun \ud83d\ude0f. \n\nKinks wise I'm practically limitless aside from a few obvious ones like rape, scat, piss, vomit, slavery, gore, vore and anal prolapsing. \n\nMy kinks include: I have a pretty big foot fetish (your feet by the way), twinks, goths\/emos, femboys, trans guys, slim or athletic bodies, power bottoming, bubble butt, smooth body, furries, anthros, sluts, threesomes, group sex, rough sex, cum stuffing, light bondage, outdoors, oral, spit, ass play, flexibility, nudism, sex games, excessive cum, teasing, details, flirting\/dirty talk, kissing, licking, biting, scratching, sex fighting, hair pulling, race play, wet sex, showers, confidence, romance, oil play and unique or loose  clothing. My main kinks would be the foot fetish, twinks, femboys, sluts, flirting, sex fighting, teasing and flexibility. Also I'll be honest, the foot fetish is kind of non-negotiable so if we can't agree on that then this might not be the rp for you. \n\nOne thing that will definitely grab my attention is if you're limitless or have a very open mind since this rp can definitely delve into some very kinky places that we can have fun with if you think you can handle it \ud83d\ude09. \n\nAlso if you have any of your own ideas then I'm all for hearing them, especially if they tie into this rp in some way. As long as they're kinky and hot, I won't have an issue!\n\nI really hope you're interested. If so then message me on kik\/Telegram at TheosK1 and we can discuss more. If you have any further questions then feel free to ask me. When you message me please include your age, kinks, limits and a ref of whatever character you'd like.

When I called her back (and totally played it off lol) she lectured me about keeping my ringer on at all times during the work day. I'm already stressed because I have lost all of my organization of my office desk, and being ADHD I've gotten distracted so much that my work is piled up and out of control. My biggest fear is that I'm going to get fired for being a complete and incompetent mess. \n\nSo, I have one daughter at home and one off at college. One time one of them started texting in the group and after a billion notifications (the Law &amp; Order \"dun-dun\"), I asked them to take their conversation out of the group because they were just texting each other anyway. My oldest daughter argued with me and told me to mute the notifications, to which I replied that I didn't want to because I didn't want to have to remember to turn them back on. They finally stopped and it hasn't been a problem until today. \n\nOver the last two days I've gotten 8 new rush jobs, for which I've only completed 6 (on top of my other responsibilities that have been neglected recently). Anyway, my youngest daughter came in to my room to tell me she got a job today. I congratulated her and told her I was proud of her. She left to go to her boyfriend's house and a little while later, she delivered her news to the group. This group also has my sister and my nephew in it and it wouldn't have been a big deal, but no one else was responding yet and the two had an 11 text conversation between the two of them about what kind of discount my daughter will get at her new job. I'm going to go ahead and add that I'm 50 and probably hormonal due to menopause (I don't really know because I had a hysterectomy a few years back but every little thing gets on my last nerve lately). So I blew up at them in the chat and asked them to take their conversation private. My oldest daughter begins arguing with me again about muting notifications and I lost it (like, all caps lost it). She retaliated by leaving the family group and hasn't texted me all day. When I bought it up at dinner, my youngest daughter said she was just about to also leave the group. \n\nAll I wanted was for them to show me a little respect and take their conversation private until I finished working. Now I feel like I have to insincerely apologize and guilt trip them for adding stress to my already overwhelmingly stressed out day. \n\nHopefully I'm doing this right.","send_replies":false,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_subscribers":2745704,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA for asking my daughters to not text during my work hours?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.8,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/j2zo0p\/aita_for_asking_my_daughters_to_not_text_during\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Then he hugged me tightly goodbye.\n\nWhen I got home from my trip, I noticed he posted the photos he took to his stories about how I inspire him and how awesome I am.
