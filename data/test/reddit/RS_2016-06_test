If the bouncer sees an out of state ID its rejected literally every time unless the person is clearly 21+. So moral of the story is I need a top of the line extremely legit california fake... I'd be willing to pay $200.

I'm 32 going through a divorce with 2 kids that's drawn out for close to a year. I saw drawn out as its been 10 months and the ex and I still haven't finalized the divorce. Not that we both don't want it but that we get along well and we both are comfortable with not being together and seeing each other date that's there's no hard feelings to push the matter. The divorce is not the reason for the post its my current situation with my current GF. So anyway after a 11 year marriage 2 months in to the single life I meet this girl, this girl that I fell for immediately and had a connection from the start. After meeting one night we had our first date the next night. And haven't been apart since. I found the void I had during marriage had been filled with this new girl. I felt wanted and loved. I felt needed again. We got along great t was like a dream. Everything we did together felt right like I was sharing all These experiences and memories not kust with my lover but my best friend. We had our ups and downs but our ups were unbelievably high like I didn't think you could have with a significant other but on the other end our lows were rock bottom lows. And as time went on and the highs and lows continued I found out things about her past and people she had been with, I found out that she had cheated on me as she admitted to it 4 months after i approached her about it ( I heard rumors). She denied it and during one of our lows she admitted to it. Well long story short she got pregnant and it just so happened that the week she got pregnant was the same week she cheated on me. It's okay though as \"he was fixed\" this is what I've been told by her and others. As if me being told that makes it any easier on me. We decided to \"start over\" come clean with the lies and start from scratch. All good on paper but it's been difficult for me not to think about it or resent her for it. But I've done my best in my eyes but not in hers and after a few months of \"starting over\" the highs and the lows continue and we're back on this roller coaster ride of a relationship. Anyway shes moving out and wants to continue to be in a relationship with me, she tells me her worst fear is myself finding another girl to replace her. I'm in love with her still and don't think I could ever connect with anyone the way I did to hear let alone replace her. She's moving no matter what and I'm worried we'll drift apart with the way our crazy schedules clash and raising kids on top of it. I feel like I can't let go of her but deep down I also know this relationship has destroyed what I was once was and the happiness I once had had long been forgotten. Was it lust? Was it love? Was it a void I was try to fill? I feel like it's truly love but I don't know if I've been blinded by this whole relationship.\n\nTldr: dating again after very long marriage am I in love and should I work this out or is it list and I'm filling a void that's been empty for year?","archived":false,"author":"Ianate","media_embed":{},"num_comments":1,"distinguished":null,"quarantine":false,"over_18":false,"link_flair_css_class":"m-io personal","permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/4lyhqq/im_lost/","id":"4lyhqq","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","is_self":true,"from_kind":null,"subreddit":"relationships","created_utc":1464740925,"edited":1464746699,"stickied":false,"hide_score":false,"downs":0}

I'm 21 at about 6' 2\" and weigh about 195 lbs, but with school getting busier and busier I've struggled with exercising enough. I've started to gain belly fat and want to stop it before it gets out of hand. In the past I would go to the gym for an 1-2 hours, but would focus more on lifting than cardio. I don't care about getting \"yoked\" or anything and don't really have access to a good set of equipment over the summer even if I wanted to.\n\nMy plan as of now is to run 2 miles a day and then do a simple routine consisting of push-ups, abs, and pull-ups. I know this really isn't much, but its better than nothing like I've been doing lately. In addition my summer internship has a soccer team I'm going to join. I don't have much details on the soccer team, but I'm sure it'll consist of a game a week and maybe a practice or two. I'll find out more later this week. I'd really just like some general advice on if my plan is solid or if it's shit and what I could do instead. I was never a big runner so no I'm not gonna go run 10 miles everyday, but I'd really appreciate advice on the latter part of my routine consisting of some basic exercises (not requiring equipment, besides a pull-up bar) such as ab workouts, push-up/pull-up routines, and any other body workouts you think would help me lose belly fat and overall just be healthy.\n\nThank you in advance for the advice! One thing my parents taught me is that your diet is one of the most important things, so once I'm back in school I'm going to do better about eating nutritious meals. "}

TL:DR at the bottom.\n\n___________________________________________\n\nI was prescribed klonopin and ambien for 4 years. After hitting a tolerance withdrawal and dealing with daily issues from these pills, I realized it was time to come off. After attempts to slowly taper off failed, I detoxed from both of them in September 2014.\n\nI went through the usual rough benzo withdrawal. I was bedridden for about 8 weeks, but I began getting better after that. My cognition returned, went out socializing again, driving again, went back to work, etc. I was still out of it, especially with fatigue and severe insomnia, but I was functional.\n\nAfter being back at work for a while, the insomnia I had was making it hard to get my job done. I was literally up for days at a time. So I saw an outpatient psychiatrist from the detox center I went to and I discussed this with him. I explained how disruptive it was and how I was having some minor anxiety during the day. I also explained to him how extremely hesitant I was about going on any medicine after the issues I had with benzos and ambien and the concerns I had with any type of psych meds, but wanted to see if he had anything else that could be taken short term. After a few discussions, I agreed to go on gabapentin for the short term. He assured me it was a \"safe\" \"non-addictive\" medication with \"absolutely no risk of withdrawal whatsoever\" and would not require any type of taper to get off of them. I began taking 1200mg per day (300 AM, 300 PM, 600 bedtime) under the plan that this would be a short term thing.\n\nWell, I began taking them and getting the sleep I need, but it quickly began causing psychological problems such as severe depression and anger issues. I thought nothing of it at first, thinking it may just be benzo withdrawal playing games with me. I told the doctor of this and he upped my dose to 2100mg per day. At this point, my psychological issues got worse and I developed physical issues, such as nerve pain, heart palpitations, etc. I told him of this and he upped my dose again to 3000mg. At this point, I realized that gabapentin was the culprit, as I was having these problems in interdose withdrawal and was still having them to an extent all the time. This was after one month of taking them, and I knew it was time to get off. After three brutal weeks of several ER visits and a five day inpatient stay, I received no help with these problems and just stopped the medicine cold turkey. This was March 25, 2015.\n\nIt has now been 14+ since my last dose of gabapentin and my life is a nightmare. Immediately stopping the medicine, I was rendered incapacitated. I was in an EXTREME amount of physical pain (nerve pain, pins and needles, heart palpitations, violent shakiness, etc) and psychological torture (derealization, irrational fears, severe regret, etc). Words won\u2019t be able to do it justice just as to how horrific it was but it made my c/t of benzos seem like a Bahama vacation with playboy playmates. Eventually, I began getting better slowly (key word very slowly) but other things have not improved at all. Right now, I have severe anxiety, heart palpiations, my hair does not stop falling out, I have cognitive impairment, I have alcohol &amp; caffeine intolerance, I can\u2019t drive or travel (I have severe travel anxiety), etc. The derealization, irrational fears, and other psychological issues have subsided significantly. The nerve pain has also subsided but it is still present, and resurfaces severely whenever I consume alcohol, caffeine, or any type of medication.\n\nI have gone to countless doctors (psychiatrist, internist, pain management, neurologist, etc) and nobody has any idea what is wrong with me. The only thing I have been told is from the medical director of the detox facility, who simply told me that I am wrong for thinking gabapentin caused this (but can\u2019t offer any type of alternate explanation). I see a neurologist currently who is much more helpful than other doctors I have seen. I got an MRI, CT scan, bloodwork, etc. and everything comes back normal. I have tried numerous medications with him, such as prazosin, propranolol, Dilantin, tregritol, and memantine, and all have done the same thing; they make my anxiety, nerve pain, and heart palpitations 100x worse, as well as give me OCD thoughts and bring back irrational fears, and this lasts for weeks after taking just one dose.\n\nTo say it has been a rough year and a half is obviously a brutal understatement. My life has been destroyed and all joy has been sucked from it. I can\u2019t enjoy a beer with my friends, drive to my job, go on vacation, advance my career, improve my living situation (I had to move back with my parents after having my own 2 bedroom apartment with a great balcony), or pursue a romantic relationship. I am 29 years old and need this to go away so I can get on with my life.\n\nI have been posting on Blue Light and an extroadinarily helpful member discussed my issues with me. He believes that the issue stems from the possibility that gabapentin has disrupted GABA-B receptors and calcium channels, and that a GABA-B antagonist would be worthwhile to attempt to correct or improve this.

Including cooking. \n\nI've never been into cooking so I made whatever had directions on it. And my mom was super depressed for a straight month, cause of my dad leaving and her being disabled, she was confined to the couch for a month straight. I had to do all the cooking and because I felt bad for her, I made the food mostly for her. \n\nYou can say I went into a sort of hibernation mode. Giving most of the food I made to my mom and eating whatever she didn't want or when she told me to. \n\nAbout a month passed and my dad came back. He was super depressed because of what he left me in and came back to help. (don't flame my dad please I've forgiven him)\n\nFlash forward to now, I'm 17 and I don't even know my weight. I'm guessing I'm around 100lbs if that because my ribs are visible and my wrists are thin enough for my other hand to wrap completely around them with extra fingers left over. \n\nI've tried everything to get back the way I was. I've upped my meals a day to 5-6 but its been months and still no progress. In fact my dad says I look even thinner.

I was shaken with that news.\n\nI left that appointment knowing exactly what had to be done. I'm not an idiot, none of us are when it comes to food. Having not eaten that day, I started on my journey. I knew that any and all sugar products, and any grain based carbohydrates were out of the question. \n\nI've know I needed this for so long. I'm a baker, and I love to cook. I thought I was cooking healthy things for my family. Foods they enjoyed. Relatively health for them, but not for me. I was so scared to start this. I had to evaluate what exactly I was scared of. Scared of being hungry was what immediately came to mind. Which is silly to think about, but that's the truth. So I made a decision that being hungry was better than being dead at 40.\n\nMy dad is 54, and has completely lost his vision from not taking care of his diabetes. He has since completely reversed his diabetes by following a loosely keto diet, but his vision cannot be restored. A hard lesson and cautionary tale. I didn't and don't want to be that. \n\nI had another appointment with my general practitioner exactly two weeks after I embarked, and I'd lost 11 pounds. I was ecstatic!  My blood pressure has been so dangerously high for so long, but when I went in, it was normal! I cannot express the joy I felt, I almost cried. My nurse was so happy for me and very encouraging. It was hard, I won't lie. I was obsessed with food for about 6 days. I felt like utter shit. I was shaky, weak, dizzy, and the cravings almost swallowed me whole. But I kept my goal in mind. I have another appointment this thursday and I'm actually excited for the first time, just to see more improvements!\n\nI feel fine now. I feel full. I'm mildly hungry throughout the day, as I really only eat between the hours of 8pm-12am. Right from the start I've stayed at around 1750 calories a day(which is being lowered to 1550 in a week). I don't feel deprived(every time I read that statement from others I'd say BS), but it's real and true. Cravings are gone completely. I've never been more certain of the right choice in my life, and I'm excited for the future.\n\nThank you, dear redditors! I've consumed every ounce of advice and every story, and they have propelled me forward.\nSorry if this is very long, I'm just really excited and I never post on reddit. To those just starting out, please please keep with it. I never thought this was something I could do, but my god it is empowering to know I'm doing it dammit! \nCheers\n\n","over_18":false,"permalink":"/r/keto/comments/4lymuc/svsw390_cw_379_gw170im_still_quite_new_to_keto/","link_flair_css_class":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"stickied":false,"downs":0,"hide_score":false,"id":"4lymuc","subreddit_id":"t5_2rske","created_utc":1464742918,"subreddit":"keto","is_self":true,"from_kind":null}

I primarily work as an accounting manager, but due to the nature of our structure, I help out and provide input on some of the programs we run.\n\nOne of the programs we run is called the Used Oil program, which is a grant funded program. We attend events, set up a booth, take in and recycle used oil, give out free oil collection containers, oil filter wrenches, shop rags, and some random non-car related promotional items. We also take in your old oil filter and you get a new one for free. The mission is to create awareness of recycling your oil properly, but to also attract DIY'ers. We attend events such as car shows (not car forum meets, large car shows) or we have oil recycling events at local car parts stores. We run radio ads and some newspaper ads. \n\nI'm asking for ideas on what else would be beneficial to a program like this. This has to be oil-related, so it's not like we can throw in free air filters or spark plugs. It's a grant, so it has specific language as to what we can spend the money on. \n\nA little bit of background on me: I love cars and I love working on them - I bought a shitbox Mazda RX-7 when I was 16 (I'm 28 now), it broke down within a few weeks, so I bought a Haynes manual and a Craftsman toolset and figured out how to fix it. I owned several more RX-7's after that, and I got into track days and broke and fixed a lot of things. Most of them were rotary powered, but I did an LS1 swap to one and LS6 swap to another. I still own an RX-7 to this day as well as a Miata. \n\nMy only intention is to give back to the car community as I think this is an awesome hobby to have and I really want to maximize our dollars to give back as much to the DIY crowd as possible. \n\nThanks!","archived":false,"score":2,"author_flair_text":null,"media":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/4lynj4/need_ideas_on_a_government_funded_program/","distinguished":null,"num_comments":6,"media_embed":{},"author":"UODrew","quarantine":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"permalink":"/r/cars/comments/4lynj4/need_ideas_on_a_government_funded_program/","over_18":false,"from_kind":null,"is_self":true,"created_utc":1464743192,"subreddit":"cars","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhl2","id":"4lynj4","downs":0,"hide_score":false,"stickied":false,"edited":false}

Now I'll probably eat more calories but do my best to lean bulk with cardio so I can trim up the fat too. \n\nI don't use myfitnesspal religiously but I did for about 3 months which allowed me to understand the foods I've been eating and how to reach calorie goals.\n\nCurrent numbers. I've been benching again and my max one rep set is about 245. My heaviest squat set is 315 x 5.\n\nProgress: https://i.imgur.com/7B1cwO6.jpg. The photo on the left was around 210 when I realized I wanted to take a process photo. Photo on right was taken 2 weeks ago.\n\nFinal note: just wanna say how motivating everyone is on this subreddit. Watching much larger people cut down to absolutely shredded beasts makes me work harder and harder every day, and I thank everyone in here.\n","secure_media":null,"media":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4lynjc/transformation_tuesday_m24018_to_17020_years_old/","score":0,"author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"num_comments":1,"media_embed":{},"author":"FanTazTikFox","retrieved_on":1472734002,"ups":0,"thumbnail":"self","from_id":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"locked":false,"link_flair_text":null,"saved":false,"from":null,"title":"Transformation Tuesday!

I also enjoy anime and manga, with my favorite being Bleach and Naruto(I also like One Piece, and open to trying new anime if it suits my taste). My favorite types of video games would have to be FPS(sometimes CoD, but I can only stand about an hour of it before getting infuriated), action rpgs, jrpgs, and Action/Adventure.

Also because of certain health conditions, I can't tell when people are being sarcastic, along with other social stigmas, but my mental health has never been better thanks to the right medications and therapy.

I have since scored a (previously ) coveted federal government position which is more or less permanent. My pay is low ($65k) but benefits are good (defined benefit pension) and the top for managerial position would realistically be around $95,000. To be competitive for this position I spent a lot of time in school, obviously, with the end result being that I'm 35 years old with only about 3.5 years under my belt. Not to mention that 6 months before I got my job the government increased mandatory years of service from 30 to 35 meaning I'd have to work to 68 to receive a full pension with very significant penalties for early retirement. Many I've spoken to said they've highly valued these positions, some saying as much as a 1.4x more to account for good pension and security. Plus the public sector pays substantially more than private sector for biologists / GIS. Anyway, I have 12k loan debt, no house (I live in one of the most expensive cities in north America) no family or kids. Already I'm feeling I can't do this job till I'm 68! My question is would you recommend trying to leverage my secure position to start a small side business (e.g. business loan) or do something else entirely to achieve financial independence? One final note that a mentor once told me that the only remaining secure jobs are in government and as such, government workers are preferred small business loan candidates, so that could be a factor."}

One that comes to mind is not respecting my boundaries. She does this by treating me like a child (I am 28 and have been away from home for 10 years), being overly affectionate in public, demanding to be included/control my life decisions, wielding guilt like a weapon, and overall just completely oblivious to how this makes me feel. She treats me like an extension of herself. She completely ignores my choices. Actually sometimes she latches onto something she claims that I've said and will NOT let go of it. Like if in casual conversation I mention that I need new pants she goes out and buys me a bunch of pants that she likes even though I've told her not to because I don't like her taste in clothes. It's just a way for her to have control. I've tried to talk to my dad about her but he says that's just how she is and to love her.\n\nWhat tipped me off that she might be N is a phone conversation I had with her. She was pestering me to move back home and have grandkids already and I told her I *never* want to move back home and I don't know if I even want kids. Major upset. She told me that sometimes that it's not about me, it's about other people and I should respect my family and do what makes them happy. I asked her about my happiness and she just changed the subject. Another time, I once went to therapy and she came with me. I talked to the therapist about my dad (b/c I didn't feel comfortable talking about my mom while she was there) and the therapist said that my dad was emotionally abusing me. (whole 'nother story). My mom said she didn't like the therapist and made me go to a different one, who was a christian counselor instead of an actual therapist.\n\nAnyway, I've been ignoring her texts and calls for awhile because she's been pestering me about my upcoming wedding, just occasionally responding to let her know I'm still alive and not to freak out. (If I don't reply for some time and happen to pick up she guilt-trips on me for about a half hour OHHHHHMYGODDYOUACTUALLYPICKEDUPTHEPHOONNNEEE???YOURESTILLALIVVVEEE???YOUNEVERPICKUPTHEPHONE!ICALLALLTHETIME!YOUNEVERCALLMEBACK!IMYOURMOTHER!!!!.) The day before and yesterday she texted me, facebooked me, and called me over and over despite the fact I told her I couldn't talk to her during those times b/c that is when I work. Apparently she and my dad were going to be visiting near my fiance's parents and she wanted to meet up with them. I gave them their number, (even though I know she already had it), whatever. She texts me before work today and I respond that I can't talk b/c I'm going to work. She responds with, ok just wanted to know where you were going to be. Oh f*ck. I know where this is going.\n\nIn the middle of my shift, during peak customers and short staff, my parents show up with a couple of their friends. Mind you my parents live far away from me so them showing up is supposed to be a big-freaking-deal but I was simply just pissed. And now I have to act so happy and surprised to see them. Here I am, a new manager to the store, and my parents show up unexpectedly during our busiest time. It felt so unprofessional to me. My boss was there and I let her know my parents were visiting and she convinced me to have a break with them even though I just had my break. She didn't get the hint or the pleading look in my eyes.\n\nMy mom grabs me and pulls me in for a hug, kisses me all over my face and won't let go of me. I tell her not to do that, I'm at work and she replies she doesn't care, I'm her daughter. Then she sees my ears and does this exaggerated pouty face and whines that I've gone up a gauge. I tell her I'll probably go up a few more. She shakes her head and tells me no. I reply that yes, I am and that I like them. Again the pouty face. She doesn't like them and she doesn't want me to have them. Whatever, next topic. She found a bunch of tourist info on places nearby where I could have my wedding and she gave it to me. She then tells me she is going to look up north (near where she is from) too. I tell her no, I don't want to be married up north. Again the hurt pouty face, like I've stabbed her puppy because she feels like I want to get married down south to be away from her. No, it's not about you! South is just prettier, and my fiance's family is from there and are a bit poorer and I want them to be able to come!\n\nF*CK. I'm tired of rehashing all of this stuff over and over and over with her. I've honestly had the same conversation with her for like 5 years. It's like I've never said one opinion of my own, she just projects her own thoughts and desires onto me.\n\nAnyways, I'm sorry if my mom doesn't exactly fit the profile but I needed to vent and thought you guys would understand. We aren't exactly on bad terms and she never abused me, I just feel invalidated when she is around. Right now staying LC is probably what I'll keep trying to do. \n\nThere is more to her but I just wanted to rant about today's event. (stuff like grandkids, living arrangements, my siblings, my brother's ex, etc.). I feel so helpless around her and if I tried to talk with her about it, it would backfire on me and she would have a complete meltdown. In fact, my brother went NC for awhile and she was constantly going through any channel imaginable to get information on him with no thought to his desire for privacy.\n\nLet me know if you guys think she qualifies and what I can do about it.

So I will be starting the replacement process for my bra drawer, and then make a new attempt at crop tops! Thank you all for your kindness and help!

I do my best to dress well. By most accounts, I've been told that I'm attractive. Naturally, I'm inclined to agree - but I understand everyone has their own preferences, so I'll let you be the judge. In terms of personality, I'm a really easy-going type of person. I'm laid back, can get along with just about anyone, and am usually a lot of fun to hang out with. I have a sense of humor, can be a little goofy at times (in the best possible way, I hope), and am respectful and kind to everyone I meet. Overall, I'm an easy-going guy with a good head on my shoulders.\n\nAnd I'll leave it at that.

I am 20 years old guy from Finland, my girlfriend is Turkish and so is her family. (LDR) She apparently made a promise to her brother that she won't date anybody until her final exam, she is 17. \n\nShe's already broke that promise, and she wants to lie that she met me in Turkey, while I want to be truthful and I think lying is never good, in my opinion it would be better to tell her brother that we've been together 7 months already (via skype etc) And I am ready to go to Turkey. She wants to tell him on the 25th day of this month, but in my opinion waiting is just making it worse. This is stressing me and I don't know what I should tell my girlfriend, I wanna settle down, I've had my fun, she says that so does she even though she's so young. \n\nWe've had a rough road, but we've gone through the worst of what can happen in a relationship and survived by forgiving and learning from our mistakes. This is also one of the reasons why I want her to tell her brother asap, I want to see that she is as serious about this as me. She claims that she is but she says that it's very important to tell it after her exams.\n\n\nShe did a mistake in a previous relationship (Nudes, jealous internet bf, you know what happens, brother saw them.) and her brother doesn't trust her. I will appreciate any advice that you will give me and I think that it's better to tell and advance or have a POSSIBLE break up than stay still forever. So here I am, begging you guys for advice even though I thought that I could go on without help. :/ Is it more strict in her culture? I will be answering any questions, I'm under heavy stress because of this so I hastily wrote it. \n\nAlso the reason why I want to take care of this so quick is because it's the next big step, we've been on the same step for 7 months. And the other reason is that she had quite a few not-so-serious LDRs before, so I kind of want a proof that we're what I think we are.\n","secure_media":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4lz67e/20m_my_gfs_17f_and_my_next_step_im_not_sure_what/","media":null,"author_flair_text":null,"score":0}

I've been watching a little girl since she was 16 weeks and is now 14 months alongside with my 20 month old daughter. Her mom and I are on great terms, we text back and forth all day long about the girls and we've been on the same page about her preferences for her daughter since day one it is an amazing situation. That being said there has always been 2 struggles that neither one of us have been able to figure out. \n\nSince the day she was born the little girl had feeding struggles and wouldn't take a bottle. They got her to take a bottle eventually but the contents needed to be borderline scalding (very hot). We've tried to ween her of this but she absolutely refuses to drink it at any temp lower than what she prefers and will go on strike and bawl her eyes out all day till she gets what she wants, her mom went an entire 48 hours over the weekend at 6 months to wait it out since \"kids won't starve themselves, eventually they'll eat/drink\" which resulted in an ER trip for dehydration. She felt horrible and mortified. We decided to wait till she was a little older and even now at 14 months we're still hit with the same problem. \n\nTo add to the situation the little girl absolutely refuses to hold a bottle and will fight attempts for you to get her to hold a bottle, she won't hold any type of cup for that matter. We've been trying to introduce a sippy cup since 7 months and have given each cup attempt 2 months before moving onto the next option. They have literally invested at minimum $100 on every type of cup you can imagine and she absolutely refuses to try them. She will lock her lips, flail her body, bawl her eyes out and scream bloody murder if you try told have her hold a cup, assist in holding it for her to take a sip or leave it in her presence because she will be thirsty and she will sooner cry unconsolable unless it's a hot bottle of milk. She won't drink juice, water, chocolate milk, lemon aid, soda - nothing, exception being prune juice which blows our minds but it has to be out of a bottle and at least room temp. \n\nNow here's the second dilemma, she's now going on a food strike the last 2 months. She used to eat any and everything in front of her but now she's throwing it all on the floor or is doing the lock lips, body flailing, bawling and screaming if you attempt to feed her. She may eat 2/3 pieces of anything on her plate but then she's done. Doesn't matter what type of food it is or how it's prepared.   We often spend 1 1/2 hours at meal times attempting to get her to eat and no snacks in between because she's started to spit them out and just play with her food. She's down to maybe her fist portion of food throughout the day and 4-6oz of milk a day, per her intake not our lack of trying to in courage her to eat. \n\nHer mom today broke down and told me she thinks her daughter is autistic which I assured her that doesn't seem right to me, she's just peculiar behavior in general and to bring it up to her pediatrician the concerns which she says she will. I do exactly as her mother asks me to and I've given my advice and insight but nothing has helped our situation. I do exactly as her mom requests and just worried at this point how to proceed. I can't get this little girl to drink or eat while she's with me 8 hours during the day, and then her parents can't in the evenings and weekends. \n\nHer behavior and attitude are being affected by this predicament, she is a LOT more irritable and whinny, unless she is being held she will cry both with me and her parents. I'm 17 weeks pregnant and her parents are worried that she's going to become too much of a hassle and I won't be able to take care of her anymore but I've assured them I don't plan on doing that to them, I'm too attached to the little girl and I have/had every intention to watch her till she starts school and her mom and I have become friends. \n\nHas anyone been in this type of situation?

There's no way to write it without coming across as being narcissistic and vain, and I hate it because that's not what I want it to be about. It makes me mad at myself. Like, why am I complaining about this when there's a ton of other problems going on? How can I let myself be so fucking self-absorbed? And it's this feeling that tears me up inside and makes me feel like absolute shit. I hate writing this. I'm sorry. But I just want to get it out because it's essentially my cry for help\n\nLong back-story short, I grew up with low self-esteem about my weight because I always considered myself to be the 'fat friend' in my group of friends, even though deep down I knew I was still a healthy weight.\n\nWhen I entered university, I thought these feelings of low self-esteem would go away. I thought that I would finally be able to accept myself for who I was, regardless of what weight or size I was. This didn't happen. I slowly gained weight until I hit a point that I never wanted to hit. Want to know the most fucked up part of this story? This 'point' was 165lbs (I'm 5'6\"). I had gained a fucking 20lbs and I thought it was the end of the world. Not 20. Not 200. A measly fucking 20 pounds. And it set me off. My feelings of worthlessness intensified. I was miserable. So I made a resolution to lose weight. And I did.\n\nI changed up my diet and exercise and within a year, I managed to lose about 10lbs. I went to the gym on a regular basis and ate according to a designated macro diet (i.e. ate X carbs, Y protein, Z fat). It was a healthy weight loss journey. I was on a decent road. Then I began seeing a guy who was very diligent in his diet and exercise routine. Although we had a great time when we hung out, I almost found him to be intimidating, just because he was so physically fit and I still wasn't exactly where I wanted to be. I felt like he deserved the kind of girl that had the smokin' bikini bod, and I didn't feel like that was me. I told him about this fear and he assured me that he liked me exactly how I was. I couldn't bring myself to believe it, so I broke it off. But the feeling of not being good enough stuck with me. I felt like I had to become the perfect individual, so I began to work harder at losing more weight. \n\nAfter the breakup, my relatively healthy weight-loss journey took a turn. I began to restrict my calories. I just wanted the weight to be gone and this seemed like the best solution (even though - thinking back - this was the WORST thing I could've done). I cut out any and all perceived 'bad' foods, including rice, pasta, most fruits, cookies, cakes, basically anything that was sweet or had carbs. It got to the point where I'd feel hungry throughout the day, but I didn't care. I wanted to lose weight. I wanted to feel like one of the skinny, pretty girls. \n\nThe restriction began to take a toll on me. I'd have protein and veggies (relatively healthy looking meals) during the day, but by nighttime, my stomach would be growling and I'd feel exhausted. Because of this, I got into the habit of eating once people had gone to bed. I felt like if no one was watching me eat, then it wasn't like I was really cheating on my 'diet'. Basically, I'd eat 'healthy' during the day, then at night once everyone was asleep, I'd have crackers and cheese and raisin bran and basically anything that was in the cupboards or in the fridge. After awhile, I noticed my weight went up a little. It was around 3-5lbs (big fucking deal, right?) but I saw this as a huge issue. It made me angry towards myself. So, I'd go through the cycle of dedicating myself to sticking to my restricted diet, feeling hungry and night-eating, then feeling like crap - and then the cycle would repeat. \n\nI don't remember the first time I decided to purge, but it was most likely after 1.5-2 months of night-eating. It felt like a combination of punishment and stress-relief, as fucked up as that sounds. Essentially, it was a way punishing the night-eating, but it relieved the stress of feeling like I'd gain weight. Eventually the purging crept in to day-eating too. I wouldn't purge after every single meal of every single day, but it was typically after meals where I'd either: A) eat too much, or B) eat any of my restricted foods. \n\nSo the purging started about a year ago, and I've continued to do it ever since. Like I said, it's not every day, but it's on days where I feel shitty about what I've eaten or if I feel like I've binged. I've lost more weight too (I'm around 130-135lbs now). Now here's another fucked up part of my story: people comment about how skinny I look... and I HATE it. I hate it because I can see they're worried. Only my mom and one other friend know about my purging, so seeing the look of worry in other peoples' faces makes me fear they know that my weight loss hasn't been healthy. I feel so ashamed. I feel like I've let everyone down, including myself. When I began my weight-loss journey, I told myself that I didn't want to become someone who was fixated on food and their weight, but I did exactly that. I became the kind of person I never wanted to be.

Tonsillitis is a lot like strep throat, except instead of it being an infection in your throat, it's an infection in your tonsils. Some of the symptoms I've experienced are severe fevers, fatigue, swollen throat, trouble breathing/eating, painful swallowing, etc.\n\nAnyways, this first time I got tonsillitis, I thought it was odd since most people get it when they are very young. I had a fever for about  a day (which was luckily on a weekend so I didn't miss school) and the swelling went down after about a week. My Nmom shrugged it off as a common cold, even though my dad did look to see my tonsils swollen, and I never got any medication for it aside from ibuprofen. About six months later, I got it again. This time, the fever hit me a lot harder and I was immobilized for nearly 15 hours. I had told my Nmom the night before that I felt a little sick, and both her and my dad were home all of the next day. I woke up early that morning (like 3am) with a bad fever but I couldn't get up to get medicine to help. Long story short, I went the entire day with a raging fever, no food or water, and unable to get myself medicine. Around dinner time, my Nmom comes storming up to my bedroom to ground me for being antisocial all day to find me being sick. She then finds me sick and passed out, then goes and yells at my dad for not thinking about checking in on me all day. After that, my dad came to my room and apologized and gave me water, but I never got the food or medicine I desired.\n\nAbout four months after the second time getting tonsillitis, I got it again. Then four months later, again. After about the fourth/fifth time I got it, I did some research and found out I had a condition called recurring tonsillitis. I now get it about every 2-4 months, usually getting worse each time, with a fever that usually takes me out of school or work for a day or two. Whenever I do get it, and update my mom telling her I have tonsillitis again, she laughs and says, \"oh not this again\" or \"sure you do,\" or tries saying I just have a cold again. Through research, some treatments of recurring tonsillitis are removal of the tonsils or laser surgery. But since my mom won't believe that I have this condition, I have never, ever received medical attention for it. I'm 16 now almost 17, and although I've only been dealing with recurring tonsillitis for a couple of years, it's become as regular as my period. I doubt that I'll ever get the medical attention I need while living under the same roof as my Nmom, and I've considered having surgery when I turn 18 and it's finally my choice, but I won't be able to afford it. Which means that it's going to be at least 5 years until I can get/afford the help I need.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this? My mom has always neglected giving me medical attention I need, whether it be this, therapy, etc. I feel like I'm going to be hopelessly dealing with constant tonsillitis; surgery or medicine seems so beyond reach at this point.","media_embed":{},"author":"p1cklebear","distinguished":null,"num_comments":9,"quarantine":false,"over_18":false,"permalink":"/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4lzbfp/rantvent_not_getting_the_medical_attention_i_need/","link_flair_css_class":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","id":"4lzbfp","subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","created_utc":1464752511,"is_self":true,"from_kind":null,"stickied":false,"edited":false,"downs":0,"hide_score":false}
