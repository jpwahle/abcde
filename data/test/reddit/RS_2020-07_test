I am 23 years old and discovered this community 2 years ago. I did PMO for 10 years and I was addicted. I developed several fetishes and my sessions went on for several hours and with several tabs open. I started doing porn when I was about 13 years old. After several relapses I am now on my longest streak of 186 days and I am a new person. So much has changed. I am still in the flatline and still have few withdrawal symptoms but these will go away over time. I have experienced 3 phases so far. I think they're all PAWS or you can call it flatline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The first phase - 27 December 2019 - 17 April 2020:**\n\nThe first phase lasted **113 days** and this was the most intense phase in my whole life. I had extreme withdrawal symptoms and I wouldn't wish that on even my worst enemy. I looked like a zombie. I had these severe withdrawal symptoms for 24 hours every day:\n\nSevere depression, severe social anxiety, severe anxiety in general, suicidal thoughts, anhedonia, insomnia, bone pain, strong pressure in the head and on the chest, negative thinking, PIED, no libido, dead dick, DPDR, overthinking, extreme brainfog, extreme shame and guilt, loneliness, hopelessness, extreme irritability by sound, light, weather, people, anything, extreme fatigue, no energy, mood swings, very little self-love and self-confidence, antisocial, nothing was fun and I had no interest in women or porn at all, frequent urination, lower back pain, heavy breathing, concentration problems, eye contact was terrible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The second phase - 18. April 2020 - 21 June 2020:**\n\nThe phase 2 lasted **65 days** and my overall condition has improved. I have noticed psychological and physical changes. I was still not feeling well but my mood has stabilized a bit. I still had the following symptoms but not so extreme anymore:\n\nPIED, no libido, dead dick, no interest in women or porn. anhedonia, brain fog, concentration problems, insomnia, frequent urination, less DPDR, less social anxiety, less anxiety in general, less depression, less shame and guilt, less irritable, less overthinking  \n\n\nIn this second phase I have noticed some new positive things:\n\nI looked a little more alive in my face and behavior. My eyes lit up more than in phase 1. The back pain has almost completely disappeared. Normal things have started to be fun again but not much. I could watch comedy series and laugh a little but not much. I could talk to a person and feel joy and laugh but not for long and not so extreme. At this stage PMO was no longer conceivable. I had a little more self-confidence and self-love. My facial expression was not dead but a little better. I had a stronger will and became more positive. I thought that after this second phase I would finally get out of the flatline but then the 3rd phase came. It gets better and better. The first phase was the worst.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The third phase - from 22 June 2020 until now.**\n\nI am now in the 3rd phase and I finally feel normal and like a person who belongs to this world. The following negative symptoms remain: PIED, no libido, insomnia, less urination.  \n\n\nI feel happier than ever. I'm no longer depressed. My social anxieties or general anxiety have almost completely disappeared. Only very little is left. I believe that these will disappear completely in Phase 4. I have much more energy and motivation. I have become very social and get in contact with my family and friends. I am interested in everyday normal things. Normal things like sports or doing something with friends are now part of my everyday life and I enjoy it. I have much better eye contact and confidence. I feel more relaxed than ever. I laugh much more and even joke a lot. I can no longer be at home but have to go among people. I have much more focus and concentration. Brain fog has almost completely disappeared. I am interested in women but unfortunately still PIED. I look in the mirror and see a positive person. I can look people in the eye and feel no fear. I can look people in the eyes and concentrate on what they say or what I say myself. My posture has also changed for the better. I can also sit normally and no longer have back problems. I don't know if I have written everything down, because it is too much. With time I become more and more extroverted and love to be around people. I cannot be alone anymore. Nofap is real guys.  \n\n\nAsk me anything.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"NoFap","subreddit_id":"t5_2skrn","subreddit_subscribers":824264,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"DAY 186 - END OF FLATLINE - PAWS - PHASES - NEW LIFE","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/NoFap\/comments\/hizgcl\/day_186_end_of_flatline_paws_phases_new_life\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I didn't even want to say anything about this because I anticipated the backlash and automatic downvotes but dammit it needs to be said because in the past few hours there has been so much whining about this. STOP WHINING AND EMPLOY BETTER TACTICS. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Are you **capping with another player**? Looking in the opposite direction of the teammate you're capping with in order to have a full range of coverage against being flanked and ambushed?\n* Do you **push for and control heavy**? Equally important, are you making sure to keep the two closest control points to heavy?\n* Do you actually stay and **DEFEND** control points?\n* **Do you do the very VERY important thing of making sure to only keep TWO of the three points so that you're not constantly losing your advantage?**\n* Do you make sure to **HIDE and not die** if the enemy team are the wolves?\n\nThese are the things good players do, and they don't even need to communicate to get them done. In both Control and Gambit Prime, the only modes of PVP I play, I am constantly going against clan stacks and winning because I adjust myself to how my teammates are playing. If come in with a defeatist mindset once you see you're up against a fireteam or clan you're gonna have a bad time. Just because there's a \"stack\" of a clan you're up against doesn't mean they're automatically going to win. They could be terrible at communication or so aggressive and focused on fighting in the middle of the map that they leave control points undefended...I see this a lot and frankly it's how I see most of my victory in such situations.\n\nAnd titles...don't get me started on titles. I'm great in Control but terrible in everything else and yet I'm 2 requisites away from UNBROKEN and lemme tell ya--I'm not exactly John Wick out there. Titles mean nothing. Stacks mean nothing. TACTICS, COMMUNICATION (and failing that, just pick a random \"buddy\" to follow and have their back)  AND STRATEGY MEAN EVERYTHING.

I have a lot of secrets, some almost as old as me because I bottled everything up into what's left of my will to live.\n\nI've been depressed for a long time now, since 6th grade where I was 12 years old. I'm 18 now and nothings changed. I started questioning a lot of things about myself about a year ago, and found out half a year later that I'm actually trans (I tried different pronouns and stuff online under a username).\n\nThere's lots of stories and moments from my childhood that I recall now, where I finally know where that \"discomfort\" I felt came from.\n\nStories I could tell a therapist to diagnose me with dysphoria... If I had a therapist.\n\nIt's been 6 month and nobody (I mailed at least 25 people now) has a spot for me. Nobody. (There was one doctor who, 2 month ago, told me he had a spot for me in October. I agreed to it and haven't got a response and I'm scared I didn't get it...)\n\nI've been suicidal since 12 years old and hid it from my mom because she had threatened me sometimes where I would have a mental breakdown to sent me to an asylum. Also, if I tell her anything, I can guarantee you everyone knows about it the next day.\n\nSo I'm 18, have graduated and my suicidal thoughts have been stronger than ever. My mom pressures me to do something with my life but I don't have the guts to tell her I didn't even plan to live that long. I spent my teenage years trying to have as much fun as possible before my inevitable death. I have no hobby, my free time consist of youtube, food and video-games and I sacrificed every task I had to do until then to squeeze in some more free time. I planned my life around the fact that I was going to die. But I'm a coward and everything is now falling apart around me.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore, I'm miserable and no-one has some time or space to help me, and the ones who do just make me feel worse.\n\nI know I need help, but the asylum threats and how bad I was treated by medical staff in the past makes me terrified of my possible future. I feel like there's no happy ending for me.\n\nI'm sorry if this post is a bit edgy or cringe or triggering, but I finally found the courage (under a fake name and newly created fake email address for the account, that's how much of a coward I am) to open up to someone.\n\nI'm sorry","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ftm","subreddit_id":"t5_2t9mw","subreddit_subscribers":111751,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I need help (trigger warning)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ftm\/comments\/hizv28\/i_need_help_trigger_warning\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I just imagined myself with a woman body, laying in my bed naked and discovering the body parts that miss irl, and I almost cried.\n\nNow about my mom: She said that I can talk with her about anything when she saw me sitting around and depressed. A few days ago she threatened  to go to the barber with me because my hair grows back (I always had the same haircut in my life, just short). I asked her if I may have long hair, and the wife of a brother of my mom's bf sat next to me and said: \" [insert deadname], could it be possible that you're a girl in a boy's body?\", and that question really surprised me, so I just sat there silenty and shrugged. \n\nAbout my mom's bf: He's 28 and has 6 siblings (well 2 left the family), they grew up in a really small village and only did things outside. They don't really respect the lgbt community I guess, so I think it could be hard to out myself to them. Their parents also grew up pretty rural. Today he asked me it I'm gay, I was surprised and said: \"no\", where he replied: \"yeah you better don't be! You're a normal boy!\".

He knows mine and my first's father sorted out our custody agreement mutually with out lawyers, and the court was only involved to get it recognized as a legal document.

I was hoping for some advice... Some info about me -- I'm 19 AFAB, and I've been on low-dose T (as in, one pump of gel 2-3x a week) for about 10 months. Prior to that, I was on some blocker that wound up making me low in both E and T. I've always had really thick, strong hair.\n\nI started noticing that hairs were thinner almost immediately after starting T (not sure if that was due to the blocker or not). I lost a lot of hair 4-5 months after starting it, but you couldn't see any difference in my scalp. My hair loss rate since then has ebbed and flowed, with seemingly no pattern. In the beginning of May, I started to notice rapid hair thinning at my temples and less severely at my crown. My hair also feels a lot more brittle now, and I'm almost scared to touch it for fear of losing more. Hair loss was once of my big cons for T, but I figured I'd cross that bridge when I got to it... here I am :(\n\n I know finasteride is a thing but I've heard there are some potentially dysphoria-inducing side effects like menstrual cycles restarting. I was wondering if anyone's had similar experiences and has any advice?? \n\n I feel way too young to be losing my hair, and it's emotionally devastating for me because, for a really long time, my hair was the only part of myself that I liked. I have a video appt with a dermatologist later this week to see if there's something else going on, but my endocrinologist hasn't given me any advice other than finasteride or lowering my T dose (which I don't think is realistic because I was constantly exhausted and had dissociative feelings that interfered with my ability to function before T). \n\nThanks in advance!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"NonBinary","subreddit_id":"t5_2vcez","subreddit_subscribers":114588,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Hair Loss Advice Low Dose T","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/NonBinary\/comments\/hj09fc\/hair_loss_advice_low_dose_t\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

My wife and I recently moved to Los Angeles and I found a good job (industrial equipment service).  I have 15 years experience in this field.  Not necessarily this particular equipment but wenching industrial equipment in general.  I'm not awful at it.\n\nThere's parts of my job I absolutely love, like getting out into the field, learning about what customers do, building that relationship with them and helping them by making their stuff work better and teaching them to use it properly.  That's the fun parts, I love those parts.\n\nThe biggest drawback is the earning potential.  I mean I don't want to sound like a douche, but it's a little north of 70k with full benefits and a company car.  Annual raises, benefits, etc.  Like I said it's a good job, maybe even a great job, but I'm not happy doing it anymore and in ten years I'll be making somewhere around 90, but I feel like that's not enough and not in a greedy way either.  It's hard to explain but basically no matter how much I work at this job my earnings are capped and that's a little frustrating.  If I bust my ass maybe I'll get to be a manager in a few years, make more money and be chained to desk, giving up the best parts of the job for cash.\n\nI never went to college, I've been working since high school.  I cooked for a few years, drove a truck for a few years, but eventually taught myself computers and IT in general and found my passion.  I love it.  That's my jam.  I'm good at it too, I rose from entry level tech to domain admin at a fortune 500 company in just a few months.  I'm a tech geek.  I love programming, I've taught myself a bit of that and write programs to automate as much as possible.  I'm a big believer in working smarter not harder and using technology to do that.  \n\nWith that in mind, I almost landed a B2B tech sales job here in LA before my current job.  I was so excited at the possibilities.  In the end after the assessment they decided I wasn't a fit.  Huge letdown, especially when my contact tells me I scored higher than anyone they ever tested, and that they not only tested all the applicants, but the entire company when they implemented this.  Brainpower apparently isn't an issue for me.\n\nIt was the Predictive Index that did me in.  My contact said my A line wasn't what they were looking for.  The other lines were ok, but my A was just too low.  It's my understanding that that's the most important one for a sales career.  I'll admit I'm not the aggressive in your face sales type, but if I smell blood I can be relentless, just in a more low key way.  I'll doggedly follow up until I receive a hard no, and even then I'll check in from time to time (previous job had a little sales, just a taste.  Not enough to call myself a salesman but enough to open my eyes to the possiblity of being one).\n\nI love love love to work.  I'm at my happiest when my plate is full and my days are long(ish).  I need to stay mentally present in whatever I'm doing.  When the mental challenge is gone it's hard for me to stay engaged.  I feel like sales is always challenging, trying to find an angle to get in the door, ways to upsell, new industries to expand into, etc.  And in the right job with no cap in commission the harder you work the more you earn.  That's a huge motivator for me.  Again it's not even the money so much as it is being paid what you are worth.\n\nTo sum up, I love to work, talking to people, technology, helping people be better at whatever they do, and I love a challenge.\n\nSo please be honest everyone.  How much of a hit do you think I have to take to make this happen?  Where would be a good spot to start?  I feel like I have one more evolution in me before I retire, one more career to learn and hopefully excel at.  At 45, I feel like I'm just figuring out who I am and what I'm capable of.   \n\nOr should I just be content to ride this very adequate job into the sunset (I just threw up writing that), knowing I'll have a roof over my head and food in my belly, and maybe a desk with a nameplate in my future?\n\nEdit:. Wow thank you guys!  The response has been overwhelmingly positive.  I'm going to take all the advice, read everything mentioned, and generally study sales while Rona rages.  When she settles down I'll be ready to make the change.  The good thing is I have a job so I can wait for the right position, I don't have to take the first offer.

I have ASD, OCD, a personal history of trauma and bullying... Not a great combination. Lately I've been going through a \"quarter life crisis\". Idk if anyone can relate, but when half the shows you've watched and half the books you've read center around people who are younger than you forming close friendships, having wild adventures, finding themselves, and you've lived a pretty tame life, you get stuck in this rut. Thinking, \"why do I feel like these eighteen year olds have lived more than me?\"\n\nI'm gonna be out of college in a year, and we'll see what happens then. I'd like to apply to grad school abroad (as in the UK). I'm  afraid that things just won't come together, though. I've had close-ish friend groups before (sometimes I wonder if we were ever all that close, though). I have one close friend. I had two relationships, one serious, as a Sophomore in college (and I just haven't had the time to date since, especially with all the moving around and now being stuck at home all day). It's not like I haven't ever had nights out or outings to new  places with my friends, but it was only a few times a month or year (depending on the friends in question), and I also dealt with anxiety all the while. I always envied people in college who'd talk about how their friends had regular movie nights and were all super close-knit.\n\nSo enter COVID quarantine. Now everyone seems pretty isolated. My twin brother has insinuated himself with a group of kids (or young adults) from our graduating class. I'd like to go along with him, but when the opportunity presents itself, I feel tons of social fatigue come on strong. I want to have friends and all, but now I'm second guessing myself. Do I really want to go out all the time, or do I just think that's what I want because pop culture shoved this whole \"magical youth\" thing down my throat? \n\nIs it unrealistic that I expected my college years to be filled with parties and awesome friends and fun times? Like, yeah I know some people have that experience. But maybe it's better to accept that it's okay never to have those \"magical youth\" periods in your life. And once I accept that, maybe I'll be okay with staying home more often. Or I may come to the conclusion that I still want to go out and make friends.\n\nI guess my question is: how do I set realistic expectations for my youth and social accomplishments, and then set goals for myself? How do I know something is both realistic and something I want, and not an unrealistic expectation or something that current culture just pushes as the ideal?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"selfimprovement","subreddit_id":"t5_2qmbm","subreddit_subscribers":828716,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Deciding what I want in terms of friendship.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/hj0omy\/deciding_what_i_want_in_terms_of_friendship\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Through desperation and sheer will I still finished my last year with good grades, enough to be accepted into an amazing grad school, but it was a significant dip on previous years.\n\nBut then over the course of my PhD it's just been getting worse. It started with a few days of missed work, here and there. I don't think my living situation at the time helped -- just renting a room in a house, with a live-in landlady who was actually horrible (even though she seemed nice enough at first). So I'd just shut myself away in my room all day, slink out to make food (lol, reheat in microwave) when no one was home. Honestly, I think it accelerated the downward spiral a lot, as it brought back a lot of bad memories of my abusive upbringing -- of not feeling like I belonged in my own home, being judged for every action, just hiding in a quiet corner of refuge (yet still worrying someone would barge in any minute).\n\nI'm in my own place now, but things are still bad. I think covid isn't helping -- since March I've done maybe a few weeks of worthwhile work, but there have been weeks on end that I have done \\*nothing\\*. I've told my advisors and they're nice about it and all but I have a first year progress update coming up in 2 weeks that I've barely started and I go entire days just staring at a computer doing fucking nothing. I go days without brushing my teeth, without showering. Sometimes all I'll eat in a day is bowls of cereal. I walk a lot and that used to clear my head but now I'll just walk outside for hours with no sense of direction or track of time. I feel like I'm not in control of my life at all anymore and I just can't deal with the constant guilt about the opportunities I'm wasting.\n\nI spoke to my tutor recently and he put me in touch with the uni mental health advisor. We spoke on the phone for about an hour, and she was helpful, and listened to my problems. But then her next phone call was basically just \"register for uni counselling and \/ or talk to your GP about going on antidepressants\" without any guidance on doing either of those things. I'm an international student and haven't registered with a GP in this country yet, because I need my medical records to do so -- medical records which I've tried to obtain before but can't work out at all because my country's health records are all decentralised, so I'd need to know who my childhood GP(s) was \/ were, but I aged out of foster care and don't speak to my bio parents anymore. I'm sure there must be someone who would know how to get them for me, or how to register with the GP without them, but it just feels like an insurmountable task. I'm such a failure that I can't even register for counseling properly and that just crushes me.\n\nI don't even know if what I'm experiencing right now is just some weird fucked up complex grief because my estranged brother died 18 months ago and my childhood best friend died back in February, or if this is just who I am now and my brain is actually broken. I don't know. I used to be such a high achiever, such a hard worker, used to shit out 12 hours of work straight no problem. I just want to go back to that. I want things to be how they used to be. \n\nI know that's a lot of stream of consciousness, but given the whole too-fucking-stupid-to-register-for-counseling thing I just had to vent somewhere.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"depression","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqqf","subreddit_subscribers":762915,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I'm so tired of being a failure","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.76,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/depression\/comments\/hj0tre\/im_so_tired_of_being_a_failure\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

My dad left when I was 10 and my brother was 6. He immediately married the woman he had been seeing. She had a daughter and he took her on. \n\nMy dads late 70s now. I am 45. \n\nAfter my dad left my mom moved in her bf who was violently abusive to her. Eventually this moved to sexual abuse with me. My dad knows nothing of this. \n\nThere were a lot of empty promises from my dad growing up. I ended up not talking to him for about 10 years but reconnected when I got married to my ex. That was over 15 years ago. I am happily married now, but during that time I was a single parent. I had the opportunity to buy my house and asked my dad to be guarantor as I was at uni at the time. It was the last opportunity to buy my house as the government was ending the right to buy scheme. The payments would be less than my rent. I would have paid off the mortgage by now, I\u2019ve never missed my rent but my dad said no. \n\nHowever him and his wife managed to buy my grans house and my aunts house : both sold for a hefty profit when they passed. \n\nHis wife had since passed. He owns 2 houses now a total of about \u00a3360k. \n\nHe\u2019s just told me that my step sister will inherit the majority he has left me and my brother 33k each. \n\nSo I am still renting and everyone else in the family has bought their home. Initially my dad told me that my step sister would get the bigger house and me and my sibling would share the smaller. I didn\u2019t have issues with this as she has been there and doesn\u2019t know about my life, the empty promises growing up (promised me money for passing exams etc.) \n\nBut now he is telling me I will receive a nominal amount, about 16k less than he promised. I\u2019m not going to fight about this with my step sister, it\u2019s not her fault. \n\nBut through the years there has been so many empty promises, I\u2019m not even fussed about the money it\u2019s just he\u2019s such a taker backer of everything. Like why say something if you don\u2019t mean it. \n\nThe majority of the money has come from buying up houses on my side of the family. I genuinely don\u2019t grudge my step sister she\u2019s lovely and she really has no idea. I think she believes it\u2019s all my fault not looking out for my dad, she has no idea of the pain. At one time he told my mom he didn\u2019t need us because he has a new family. \n\nShould I tell my dad of all the hurt, and that I don\u2019t think his will is fair? Or just let it go? I don\u2019t know if I have that much time his health isn\u2019t great. I\u2019d like to hold him to account for abandoning his children but maybe it\u2019s too much water under the bridge? \n\nTl:dr dad leaving me and my brother a nominal amount in his will after a lifetime of broken promises.
