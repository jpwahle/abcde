We kept making plans to hang out but he said he had a super busy job with travel and since I'm dating around, I was never too concerned about it. He kept calling/texting/checking in almost daily so I know he was interested.\n\nThe other day curiosity got the best of me and I did some creeping and I found out he's married with a 10 month old baby.

After visiting the subreddit for it, I became fascinated with them and desperately wanted one for myself. The way it just sticks to the wall or floor and you can please yourself however you like was more than enough temptation for me to get one. It had gotten to the point where I'd even had a bit of a wet dream about it, imagining how great it'd feel to have it stuck to my gaming chair while I played online for hours. Once it came in the mail, however, I wasn't expecting how useful it'd be, even if not stuck to anything. \nI started using it more and more in the shower, but my favorite thing was to slip it all the way in and just hold it there, letting it push against every inch of me, pressed firmly against my back wall. It felt incredible somehow, the feeling of it pushing me to my limits and filling every inch of me. \n\nI guess it became a newfound fetish of sorts. \n\nFlash forward a few days from its delivery and I started using it almost every day. I must admit that I'm a bit of an addict now, as the feeling of orgasming with it inside me has become my new favorite midnight pastime. It's getting more and more difficult to stifle the moans however, since I still have yet to move out of my parents house while in college. \n\nMy parents are both teachers, and they both have summers off. My vacation started nearly two months before theirs did, leaving me plenty of alone time with my new rubber friend, but now that they're out of work, I've been having to find more and more ways to satisfy my urges while they're still around. After a lot of Metal-Gear-esque sneaking into the bathroom with a dildo hidden somewhere in the elastic of my sweatpants, I started getting more and more paranoid that they'd find me and my naughty habit. \n\nHowever, the other day, it hit me. \n\nI could easily use it under the blankets of my bed, as long as I put my laptop over my lap and leave the AC on blast. I figured that way that they wouldn't expect anything, and the AC would give me an excuse to be under the blankets in the dead of summer. \nSo far, it's been absolute bliss. \n\nI've been able to spend hours with it inside me, pushing against my walls, slowly driving me crazy. I think playing video games with it in me is the best though, or watching scary movies. Every time I hit a stressful boss in TERA online or every time I come across a jumpscare I clench, and every time I clench it feels incredible. It's gotten to the point where jumpscares make me horny and I'll replay final bosses and let it get down to the wire just because of how good it feels to tighten up around it. And if I ever need a little extra something, pushing the suction-cup end a little harder into the bed gives me exactly what I need. \n\nIt's gotten to the point where I'm a little embarrassed with how much I feel the need to orgasm at this point, and yet I absolutely adore it.

For example, a stressful time, mental illness, medications, special life circumstances? Other useful information includes sex, age, and current state of mind.**\n\nMy upbringing wasn't entirely conventional - I was homeschooled from age 10 through 15 and started college full time at age 16. I am 23 and female.\n\n**Describe yourself as a person if you were to introduce yourself to someone else like in a cover letter. What kind of person are you and why?**\n\nI'm very outgoing. I bounce back from setbacks quickly. I love people. I like getting to know them and figuring out what motivates them. I like trying new things and I love unconventional viewpoints, unconventional aesthetics, and unconventional people. I am kind of lazy - easily distracted and easily bored.\n\nWhen I'm really honest with myself - I want to do the right thing and am ultimately motivated by attaining a sense of peace, but I have to get serious and strict in order to get back to this motivation.  My desire to be liked gets in the way of this frequently and I often feel self-conscious or self-aware to an extreme degree.\n\n**What were you like as a child? Think about how you were in school, with friends, and at home with your family.**\n\nI had a wonderful childhood with wonderful parents. Reflecting on it now I'd say I was very idealistic and starved for friends. I was an emotional child and remember praying intensely especially if I was scared (I'd get progressively more panicked thinking my dad died on the way home from work when he was just fine).  I would mull over spiritual questions almost every night in bed, work myself into a frenzy and then get up and run to my dad to ask for an answer. I would also frequently beat myself up and feel intensely guilty about a sin I had committed. If I ever sensed a hint of rejection from my peers I would cry and cry and make a big deal out of it.\n\nI loved being creative with my little brother - we grew up being best friends, reading constantly, inventing worlds and characters with our voices or stuffed animals or legos and making home movies and drawing cartoons. We published a kids magazine together for years, and organized a yearly 4th of July parade for the neighborhood kids. We especially loved making towns out of legos and populating them with characters that we would name and give personalities to. We also used to organize games of capture the flag with the neighborhood kids and I remember getting super excited setting up forts with all the trappings (snacks, weapons, blankets) and playing war with the rival team. I also loved drawing elaborate houses filled with animals and giving the houses special features catering to the needs of each animal. My greatest desire was to grow up and work for the CIA as a secret agent.\n\nIn public school - before I was homeschooled - I would always be placed in the talented and gifted group. I was very enamored with the IDEA of intelligence as a child and felt a strong need to prove it to others. My childhood was somewhat lonely, even when surrounded by children in elementary school, but I felt a deep desire to connect with other people. I did always have at least ONE friend throughout, and it was invariably another 'weird' or oddball little girl who I was fascinated by.  I never liked my teachers and usually started out having an unnecessarily adversarial relationship with them.\n\n**What kind of person would you LIKE to be? Why? What kind of person would you NOT want to be? Why?**\n\nI want to be a warm person who makes other people feel accepted and welcome and good.  I want to get people psyched about life. I want to inspire people to be their best selves and take action and stand up for themselves. I want to be doing interesting things and meeting interesting, dynamic people. I would also like to get creative again and create some art that is insightful and honest.\n\nI don't want to be a fraud.  Someone who is purely motivated by ego but has become so deluded by their own deceit and self-love that they don't know how to get right. I don't want to be a milquetoast person who goes along with the majority because it's easy. I don't want to be weird just to be weird.\n\n**Do you think there are any differences to how you described yourself and how people actually perceive you? How do you think others would describe you? If there are any discrepancies between these two that are you are aware of; do you know why exactly that is?**\n\nI'm different at work than I am at home than I am with friends, etc. etc. so it all depends, but for the most part I think most people I meet would say that I am a bubbly and confident social butterfly. People think I'm kind of quirky, I talk quickly and bounce around subjects.  In my teenage years I was really afraid of seeming like an airhead.  People who know me a little better know that I tend towards laziness and insecurity, and can be pretty moody in private.\n\nI know that discrepancies exist but I honestly don't trust myself to be able to say what those are in detail in an unbiased way.  All I can say is that I need to do a better job aligning my ideal self (the one with the pure motivations) with my behaviour (which is often driven by a motivation rooted in self-aggrandizement).\n\n**What in life do you find to be of importance? Why?**\n\nI think it's important to be brutally honest with yourself about your motivations and intentions.  It's important to be kind and sweet, even when you don't feel like it. It's important to love others for who they are. It's important to forgive others and it's also very important to forgive yourself after you've done something wrong. It's important to get up on your feet again after a setback and it's important to NEVER give up fighting for what's right.\n\n**Please describe yourself when you are in a stressful situation. How do you act and why?**\n\nI don't get stressed very easily but it does happen. Usually if I'm stressed it has to do with guilt or something personal like that, and I try to deal with the root of the problem asap. \n\nWhen I'm under extreme stress I'm like in an altered state. The most stressed I've ever been was probably in graduate school - I remember just compartmentalizing my life and divorcing emotion from any of the negative things that were happening because confronting the emotion would be impossible. Too much. I felt completely personally dissociated (but of course I wasn't). It catches up with me eventually.  I had a year of panic attacks and anxiety following one episode of that type of dissociative stress where I lost like 10 pounds. Horrible! But it's rare.\n\n**Describe your relationship to socialization. How do you perceive one-on-one interaction? How do you perceive group interaction?**\n\nI mean I love both. I think one-on-one is a bit more pressure because with a group you have more people to 'catch' you if you fall or take on the responsibility/burden of the social interaction. The best of one-on-one interactions probably have an edge on the best of group interactions for that reason though. But they both have the potential to be enormously fun and fulfilling.\n\n**Describe your relationship to society. What are the elements of it you hold important or unimportant (e.g. social norms, values, customs, traditions)? How do you see people as a whole?**\n\nI view social norms as highly contextual. I follow them because I'm used to them and following them can help make other people comfortable, but I'll make an exception if there are special circumstances or if I (sometimes) feel like being a punk.\n\nTraditions are fun and I enjoy them (Christmas, etc.), but I am not one to follow tradition for tradition's sake. I think it's good/positive to switch things up.\n\n**Describe your relationship to authority. How do you perceive authority? What does it mean to you, and how do you deal with it?**\n\nLike I said - as a child I'd often feel skeptical of authority figures that weren't my parents. I was highly respectful of my parents.\n\nI want the approval of the authority figures I respect, but (like with tradition) I don't just respect an authority figure because they're an authority figure. It's similar to loyalty for loyalty's sake. I don't like that. There's more to respect and loyalty than that.\n\n**Describe your relationship to order and chaos. What do order and chaos mean to you? How do they manifest in your daily life?**\n\nOrder is something I desire - I struggle to maintain order in my work life or home life. I am really bad at keeping things organized or remembering to do maintenance tasks and my parents are constantly nagging at me to do things like get my car checked or make a doctor's appointment.\n\nChaos for me is more fun - I don't really want to live in chaos forever (I do feel better when everything is ordered I just have to remember to make that order happen) but I am comfortable with a little bit of chaos in my life.  I like when a million things are happening at once, when I have every night in my calendar booked and a ton of things are happening and I am handling it all. It makes me feel alive!\n\n**What is it that you fear in life? Why? How does this fear manifest to you both in how you think and how you act?**\n\nI fear being blind to my own issues or my negative impact on others.  This will manifest itself in periods of extreme introspection (to an unhealthy degree I think). I also fear being disliked/irrelevant - this will manifest itself similarly in extreme navel-gazing, insecurity, and posturing.  I sometimes fear my future - I wonder if things will go OK - I usually deal with this by trying to forget about it - life is dynamic after all.\n\n**What is it that you desire in life? What do you strive to achieve? Why? Where do you think these drives and desires stem from or are inspired by?**\n\nI want to live a fulfilling and happy life where I feel useful and peaceful, that I am fulfilling the special purpose given to me. I want to achieve personal peace. I am pretty sure they are universal desires, but in my case they definitely stem from and are inspired by my faith.\n\n**What activities energize you most? What activities drain you most? Why?**\n\nI am very energized by\n\n* Planning new projects, planning parties, trying new recipes\n\n* New cities, the big-city feel\n\n* Really electric quick-witted conversations (banter, flirting)\n\n* Also in-depth conversations where my friends and I get closer, make new realizations, or achieve a better understanding of some issue\n\n* Playing with little kids\n\n* Reading a book that exactly captures a feeling I have experienced OR reading a book that makes me feel something brand new\n\n* Meeting people who are 100% genuine originals\n\n* Getting asked to do something or go somewhere\n\n\nI am very drained by\n\n* Chores\n\n* Dead end conversations that I've had a million times before\n\n* People who don't ask questions/only talk about themselves\n\n* People who shut a good conversation down\n\n* Inconsiderate people\n\n* Boring work projects\n\n\n**Why do you want to know your type? What type do you think you are? Why this/these type(s)? Is there a type that appeals to you, to your self-perception, that you would like to be? Why?**\n\nIt's just interesting, good for understanding myself and others better. I think I'm an ENFP - and that type appeals to me and my self-image. I like individualism and am attracted to the bright, happy sheen that comes with the ENFP stereotype, but like I said - I don't want to be living a lie either, so what do you think?","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"mbti","subreddit_id":"t5_2s90r","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Type Me","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/6kjzmz/type_me/","view_count":null}

Here's my situation: I am a private pilot in pursuit of my instrument rating and my commercial certificate. My end goal is to fly with the majors. Anyways, I'm 25 hours into my instrument training at a 141 flight school with an instructor who has his CFII, but not his CFI. I got a tip from a previous instructor, now a close friend of mine, that my CFII is not legally allowed to perform instrument flight instruction in an airplane per CFR 61.195. Upon reading this regulation and doing plenty of research on the topic myself, I've come to the same conclusion. On top of that, there are multiple letters of interpretation that are consistent with our findings that flight instruction in an aircraft with just a CFII certificate is illegal. I will attach them to the bottom of this discussion. \n\nMy CFII's certificate says \"Flight Instructor; Instrument Airplane,\" but it leaves out the class of airplane (single engine, multi engine, etc.). FAR 61.195(c) states, \"A flight instructor who provides instrument training for the issuance of an instrument rating, a type rating not limited to VFR, or the instrument training required for commercial pilot and airline transport pilot certificates must hold an instrument rating on his or her pilot certificate and flight instructor certificate that is appropriate to the category and class of aircraft used for the training provided.\" It seems pretty black and white to me, but the flight school is denying that there is any issue because they've, \"been doing it for years and there have been no issues.\" I'm just trying to nip this in the bud and cover my own ass from potential future certificate action due to improper or illegitimate training. I have nothing against this flight school or the instructor I'm working with, I just want to make sure all instruction is performed legally and within the FARs. \n\nI'd love to hear what everyone thinks about this. \n\n[Grayson Interpretation Letter](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/pol_adjudication/agc200/interpretations/data/interps/2010/grayson-2%20-%20(2010)%20legal%20interpretation.pdf)\n\n[Kortokrax Interpretation Letter](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/pol_adjudication/agc200/interpretations/data/interps/2012/kortokrax%20-%20(2012)%20legal%20interpretation.pdf)","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"flying","subreddit_id":"t5_2qm1t","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Is it legal to perform instrument flight instruction in an airplane while holding a CFII certificate, but lacking a CFI certificate?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/6kjzol/is_it_legal_to_perform_instrument_flight/","view_count":null}

We're both fairly introverted but when we're together we come out of our shells. \n\nWe hang out consistently, but we don't really text (which I honestly think is great, because I hate texting.) A little while ago, a coworker mentioned that she likes to tease him about us and that she's fairly sure he likes me.

When I walked in I was shitting myself, and so I was really awkward. But it was okay I guess. I came out feeling somewhat better, even though still really embarrassed. Later on, still on a kind of high from the haircut, decided to bight the bullet and come out to my brothers. I did it individually, and they both reacted well. Youngest didn't really judge and the other one was just like \"ohh\" and then just asked me a load of questions. Honestly I really couldn't have asked for better, and the fact that they know is really a huge wait of my back. \nThis all then moves into today. I traveled up to London to go to the GIC. There I ended up talking all of this over, and one thing led to another, and I ended up talking about when would be the best time to transition. My plan has pretty much always been to go full time, go on HRT, ect when I leave education once and for all, but the counselor guy I was seeing at the GIC was kinda debating what would happen if I said fuck it and fully transition now. The main reason I don't is because for years my only friends where people that exploited me and I was almost constantly picked on, and now, I have actually have some friends and people don't pick on me all the time, and it feels nice. And I don't want to throw that away. I've pretty much always hated school and I just want it to be as easy as possible socially. I don't want to go back to being isolated. But then again, I finished secondary about a week ago and I start sixth form in about two and a half months. I got into a really good one where most of my friends are going. I was thinking about just going full time for this period, seeing what it feels like, and see where I go from there. \nMy main question is: what do I do? I spent tonight just feeling upset, my prom was tonight and I didn't go cause I couldn't fucking bare the idea of being in a suit or going as mail, and instead I've just been sitting here at my PC, just watching livestreams, waiting for myself to get tired enough just to fall asleep. Sorry for both the length, I just really wanted to get everything out, and for any errors, I'm really fucking exhausted. Also, for context sakes, I'm 16.

So I know there are a lot of these types of posts here. But I have kind of come to terns that I am a trans women. I am 32 years old and an attractive guy. I am not overly feminine but from a very young age I knew there wasn\u2019t some quite right inside of me. I would steal my sisters underwear because I was always so jealous of why girls got the to wear the cute clothes. Hell my sister even caught me wearing her panties once. She told my mom and of course I denied it to the end. That incident never came up again. Determined to not be caught again I begin stealing my friend\u2019s mom\u2019s panties and built up quite a collection. For a while in high school this faded to the background for a few years as I was your typical teenage boy. I enjoy sports and screwing around with my buddies.\nDuring high school I didn\u2019t really date at all. I was super shy and very afraid of trying to date women. I dated a couple of girls but I could never fully get comfortable with dating a women. I did it because that was guys do.\nFresh out of high school I met a girl, things got serious, I finally lost my virginity. Hey look at me I\u2019m finally a man\u2026.right?!!?! Nope even though things were going well with this girl I lost interest in her and she then proceeded to cheat on me with my boss at the time. Similar variations of this would continue to plague my dating life. My last seriously girlfriend was about 8 years ago. We broke up because again I lost interest and at the time I was drinking a ton because I  was always depressed and never felt normal. \nIt was around time that my women\u2019s underwear \u201cfetish\u201d started to come back to the for front of my life. I was living on my own so I went on and bought some panties of my own. I would go through periods of were I would purge any women\u2019s clothing that I would by because I was ashamed and confused about all these different feelings. About two years ago I went and both a ton of panties again. Now I wear women\u2019s panties everyday and have been trying to figure out why I needed to do this and why I couldn\u2019t have a good steady relationship with a women? Anytime I would meet a women I would quickly fall into the dreaded friends zone without fail. In the past 6 months after lots of soul searching, lurking on this reddit, and ready countless stories of other people who have had similar experiences and feelings that I have had. I now know I am a trans women and I am terrified and confused about where to go from here.\n\nThanks for reading and sorry if none of this makes any sense\n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"asktransgender","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4b9","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Terrified and confused","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/6kk9mf/terrified_and_confused/","view_count":null}

She was simultaneously told she was too high risk for the surgery because of her other health problems (especially autoimmune disease). So.. that sucked. She got her affairs in order because she assumed there was nothing she could do. \n\nShe fell a few days ago after having some chest pains and went to ER. The doctor told her that her heart was barely functioning at all and that she's lucky she made it as far as the hospital. And, that she has to do the surgery within the week or she could basically die any minute. Because it's so dire, the surgeon who consulted her just yesterday said, yes there could be complications with your other health issues, but to not have the surgery means certain death anyway, so... might as well try. \n\nMy mom's 56. I'm 29. My father died when I was 21 so when she goes I've got aunts, uncles and cousins in other states but that's it. It's all a lot to bear. Despite knowing for a year that her heart was not good, nothing prepares you for the moment when shit hits the fan and you have to actually deal with it. \n\nThe other thing that's hard... she has a lot of mental health issues and has been absolutely the most intolerable patient. Angry, verbally abusive to nurses, etc. I've spent most of my time apologizing to them for how she treats them. And, she has not decided whether to have the surgery. I have to sit there and listen to my own mother tell me that she basically doesn't want to actually survive this. \"If I do the surgery and have 5 or more years added to my life... then what? I'll still be sick and I'll still be in pain and who wants that?\" \n\nIt's so hard. My mom has been sick all her life and so I thought I was used to it. I grew up in hospital waiting rooms because she always had to have this or that procedure done. But it was never life or death like this. \n\nIn my AA program I have developed a sense of a Higher Power pulling the strings behind the scenes. I've developed a faith that things will work out the way they are supposed to. This is testing that. What makes sense about possibly losing both of my parents in my 20s? What lesson could life possibly be trying to teach me, and why? This just seems cruel. I have a friend in his early 50s who is doing a lot of caregiving for his 80-something father, and I cannot help but be jealous. Both of his parents made it to their 80s and I may never know what that very typical life experience is like. If I get married someday neither of my parents will be at my wedding. If I have kids someday they will not have grandparents on my side. It's just not how life is supposed to work and I get jealous how sometimes others get to just take it all for granted. I'd give anything to take my Mom's health for granted and have her for another 20-30 years. \n\nSo far I have not had the urge to drink. I want to smoke about 10 packs of cigarettes but alcohol has not crossed my mind. I think I know on a deep level that alcohol never solved my problems and never will. \n\nBut I am still posting because I could really use some internet hugs and that talking about one's struggles is the first step toward preventing relapse. This month has been a doozy between basically losing my job and now having to   be scared about my mom. \n\n&lt;3 ","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stopdrinking","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7yr","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Mom's in the hospital for heart surgery and she is lucky to be alive right now apparently... and I'm just posting for accountability.

I ended up in a detox house. Yes, that\u2019s right \u2013 a detox house. After writing my last post, my withdrawals became so bad I thought that there just *had* to be something wrong with me besides Kratom withdrawals. I was so tired I could barely stand-up. I was not thinking straight, I wasn\u2019t seeing straight, I was a f-ing mess. I drove myself to the ER, and seeing the shape I was in, the doc suggested I go to a detox house and be treated for opiate withdrawal. I was skeptical, but they said they had a doctor there who had treated several Kratom addicts with suboxone successfully. My jaw dropped \u2013 this is the stuff they give people coming of heroin and stuff. But she assured me they had seen several patients like myself and had successfully gotten them off the drug.\n\nSo I went. My GF drove me, and I slept all the way there in the car \u2013All I wanted to do was sleep. when I was awake, I was immensely depressed.  I was checked in and given suboxone. Within an hour my symptoms were completely gone. No depression, no lethargy \u2013 I had energy and was talkative. My restless legs vanished.\nI won\u2019t go into the experience of the addiction counseling, whom I met while I was there, etc. What I will say is you think you have it bad until you see what some people go through with their drug of choice. I wouldn\u2019t call Kratom small potatoes exactly, but it pales in comparison to benzo withdrawals or detoxing off a 2 week alcohol bender.  Definitely provides perspective.\n\nSo I haven\u2019t touched Kratom in 4 days, and I am 4 days into a 10 day suboxone taper, which I am adhering to religiously. Becoming addicted to something like sub scares the crap out of me. It seems to be helping \u2013 I still have some anxiety and depression, but I have 0 physical withdrawals, and I am sleeping normally at night without the help of medication. This is far better than I expected. I was told that if I was religious about my taper, I should not experience any suboxone withdrawals. \n\nIn short, I don\u2019t think that this is the path I would recommend to others, but it\u2019s working for me so far. It\u2019s costing me a lot of $$ (my deductible is high and detox hospitals aint cheap), but I figure I would have spent that in a year on Kratom easily had I not quit.

Weve always known the new guy was crazy, drenching my moms car with roses when my mom had first met him and said they couldn't date because she was still loyal to my step. After his move in, it got worse. The first time I knew we were in for a ride was last year, when my mom and him fought on trash day and he had ran over the trash cans and I had to go outside and clean it up while he was still on our block, driving obnoxiously. It only escalated once my mom said she was pregnant, because at the time, my mom was having hesitations with him but knew that this baby sealed him with us. She cried no tears of joy that day, she didn't believe in abortion when my stepdad said he was willing to take her back until she said she was pregnant. He ruined my sisters birthday last year, July to be exact, when they hae fought, he was kicked out, and he tried breaking in through my moms windows while my baby bro has been asleep in the same room. That was the first time cops were called, and they did nothing. All the times weve called the cops, they threaten they'll take us and my siblings away, so my mom, being the fantastic person she is, lies to them everytime and says everything's fine. We are trapped and Im not even done. The time he rang our doorbell when he was kicked out in the middle of the night, my then pregnant mom answered only to be pulled outside and sat on by him. Or one time they went to go get food, my mom came home crying, because he had tried to push her out. He was even mad the day he had his first daughter, and now threatens to take her everytime they argue. But there's one fight I must share:\n\nIt was after March because my sister was born by then, and he had came home drunk, and my mom finally fed up with how disgusted she is, how's he a liar, doesn't pay bills (we had went to a hotel when he didn't pay electricity), is just so many more reasons. I have so much stories guys, but my thoughts are scrambled as of now. So she had gone to the room and just began ratting on him and going off. When my sister had walked in the room to see what was going on, he was grabbing my mom by the hair and throwing her into the mirror. When I had walked in, I saw my sister being choked. I wasn't born a fighter but I hit him, punched him, bit him, and he threw me over my mom. I got back and hit him but he then ran to my sisters crib and tried running with her. When basically covered each door way while he ran aimlessly, trying to get out while my older sister had called the cops. And you know what the cops did once they got there? They threatened they'll take us from my mom. My mom lied and said we were fine, just he had came home angry and he only left for one night and was there once I came home from school tomorrow. Two months later, my mom told my family, and my family offered help, but my mom refused, because I don't know why. \n\nMy mom and him have fought with knives, bit each other fingers till they break, but I don't want to leave, because I'm trapped and I'm loyal to my mom. Today my mom was sick and had went to my grandmas while he was at work and once he found out, he threatened to bang down the walls and hurt my dog. \n\nReddit, idk what to do anymore. I don't want to leave my mom,and I will fight for her because we are truly trapped. My mom is nowhere crazy, and has cried so many times, Im not effected by it anymore. We dread the sound of his truck when he gets home. The police wont help, they won't arrest him or take him away because if we actually do tell them the truth, we will be taken away from my mom, and I wanna stay with my mom. I shouldve made a throwaway but idk, there's so many stories and I needed to get off the drastic stuff off my chest, but I have so much more.

recently I found a little gem of a Gif over on a Hypnosis subreddit and...well...it got the wheels in my mind turning and the ideas began to go spark. So much so that I felt like I needed to play this out with someone or someones. Yes, I'm looking for men too. Specifically, subby men who like to please or enjoy a fair bit of cuckolding and feminization.\n\nWhat I was thinking is that I play a dominant that the two of you come across online. You two are curious but willing to try anything at least once. So, I send you two a little video of what exactly I can do. Little do you know that this video is a training video to turn you into my cute little obedient slaves. And, once you've watched it, you have no other pleasure in the world than my voice. My touch. My control. \n\nI'm fine with other scenarios as well. Maybe you're siblings or related in some way? Maybe you're friends looking for some relaxation guide and stumble on me. Maybe the two of you know exactly what you're getting yourself into, finally taking the plunge and becomings someone's hypnotized sex toys. Or maybe we're just a bunch of gamers that never meet in person, and I send you two a video to turn you into my personal HealSluts. The possibilities are endless and open on this one. \n\nNote: You don't actually have to be a couple or be in a relationship to play this out. However, you do get bonus points if you are. You can also get points for playing a lesbian couple/sisters/two females in general, for being both taller than me (I'm 5'9\"), or being an interracial couple. I also have a few pictures from the artist I can show you for some other prompt ideas. \n\n-----------------------\n\n[Oh Hey! I have a Kinkslist now.

Now more than ever I feel like no one wants to listen, people only get ahold of me when they need something. So hear goes. I was dating this girl for just about 2 years. It started off a little rocky. But we made it thru, because every relationship has problems right? So I was in the Navy at the time, and I decided I was going to leave the navy to start a life with her. So I left the navy to be with her. Never have I ever given so much into something. So I come home and 3 days later were living together. She always told me how much she loved me and she was always talking about our future together. We were actively looking to buy a home as well. So I always did the little thing, I cooked, cleaned, did the dishes and the laundry. Andd I paid most of the bills. Mind you I work a full time job as well. Everyday when she would come home I'd have dinner made. I would do all the little things that she loved, like gently running my finger nails scratching her back or up and down her legs. We were so happy together. And I finally opened myself up about marriage, although she asked me every week to marry her. Lol. So about January she started hanging out with this girl she went to nursing school with. I instrantly had a bad feeling. Mind you. I'm 22 and my girlfriend was 21. We're old people at heart. Not much into partying. Well this girl she started hanging out with is 28. So this girl I've heardd about how shess a home wrecker and what not. That she just loves to destroy people's relationships. So once she starts coming around, my girl starts acting weird. Buying dresses and puitting on make up, mind you she's a blue jeans girl and she hardly ever wore makeup. So she starts changing. One night were at the bar and I'm the DD, her friend comes over to me and asks me to come dance with her, I said no. She replies with \"did you just tell me no?\" I said yes, she came in really close and said \"you wouldn't be saying no to me if youir girlfriend wasn't here.\" So I tell her my girl about it the next day, she becomes furious. But still continues to hang ouut with her. So they start staying out on the weekends until 4am. Coming home completely drunk and what not. So she ends up leaving me, saying how I made her miserable and what not. And her \"friend\" starts blaming me for her failing out of nursing school and that I treated her bad and what not. Mind you I literally did everything for her. So after she left me she kept saying about how much she loved me and she want ed to be with me and she still wanted to be friends. Well now she has me blocked on Facebook and what not. She blocked me again today because I liked one of her posts. Mind you she keeps me blocked for a few weeks then unblocks me. I guess my biggest fear is her trying to come back after everything she has put me thru. Am I wrong to feel that way? I tried talking to a new girl, but  I ran into her at the bar and she was being obnoxiously loud and I could hear her talking about me. I'm justy not sure whaty was said. Please any advice would be great! How do I start to move on knowing that the woman who I was suppose to marry, pushedd me away like I was nothing after her \"friend\" came into the picture ","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationshipproblems","subreddit_id":"t5_3913f","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I gave her everything and she left","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipproblems/comments/6kki0m/i_gave_her_everything_and_she_left/","view_count":null}

We cum out sparkling cum that matches the color of our cocks, and it weakens us. It takes 3 orgasms to defeat me. The third orgasm will make me cum and cum sizeable spurts as my cock shrinks bit by bit, until its 2 inches, shriveled dry - leaving me completely defeated.\n\nFor the quest, I was thinking it could be Escape Everlust Dungeon! I have a backstory in mind, but this can be altered for however you'd like to approach it!\n\nI would like orgasm scenes to be long, detailed and I'll match you're description! I was thinking we could also use dice, and there can be loot, gear, leveling up and skills!\n\nFor weapons, the great majority of them would be dil and vi (vibrator) replicas of what they're based on, dilsword, viaxe, vigreatsword, dilarrow, dildarts and for traps, dilspikes, hot jello cum etc. There can also be whips, cuffs, poisons that induce lust or cumming, strapon sheaths that inhibit orgasm and force them to build etc. We can talk about more too!\n\nClothes will serve as armor and there can be earrings, lipstick, makeup, hairdye, stockings, different lingerie, fingerless gloves etc.\n\nIf anyone's interested please message me!","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[22F4A] Escape Everlust Dungeon!

I'll keep it short and precise to get some comments.\n\nI've been developing a intense sense of anger and frustration within myself, and I feel like I'm becoming more aggressive. Somehow, this has lead to the increase and urge for masturbation for me, mainly because I don't have a room to sleep in my family's apartment, since we moved here in Early June when I went off to College for a few days after we had the yard sale at our old home and we sold the house. \n\nA few days ago, I made a thread in regards of apologizing to my parents or getting into an argument with them, but mainly the latter since I apologized to them afterwards. My parents and I, after the incident with my psychiatrist (of whom I could never forgive the three for for manipulating me), especially my Dad, has become more bitter with me mainly due to how he never expresses his feelings with me. He rarely says he loves me...ever. And this has lead to me to a mistrust of adults in general, despite the fact that I'm 19 with Asperger's/Autism, even though I feel like I failed myself by going to the wrong college and screwing up because of medications and commute problems. Now, I feel like I'll never make any friends.\n\nIn regards of masturbation, there has also been a problem with my sexuality and interaction towards others. Given, I tend to be masculine in an androgynous way in terms of personality and appearance (somewhat; I do shave and wax), but I could also be ambiguous in interaction with both genders. However, part of me feels that I shouldn't get too attached to people, or that I shouldn't get involved in a relationship, despite my need to make friends. I have fears of being considered perverse, but I also fear getting into a relationship with someone because people always say \"women are trouble\" and such (idk, I'm just talking nonsense now).\n\nStill, there's a part of me that desires sex, but I do not like the idea of controlling or protecting others in a way that would seem \"barbaric\", even if it is considered \"biological\" by nature. However, there's also a part of me that wants to be dominant. It's like on the outside I have this tough exterior that wants to be in control and eat spicy food and just be manly in general, mainly due to the heavy French influence my family has and how most of the men in my family are chefs or golf players, not mathematicians, computer programmers, or scientists; the latter 3 of which I am very, very interested in. Because of my family, I feel that men today have no backbone, but I also feel that I'm better than this and should focus more on being myself and just be a little more in tune with myself and be shy/sensitive and such and focus more on furthering evolution for the human race, rather than regress back to the Neanderthals, which explains the cold, soft interior. \n\nGiven, I'm not really the type to like sports or alcohol or smoking. A lot of my hobbies tend to consist of teabrewing, computer programming, model building, botany/plants, drawing, etc. even though I've only learned about these and not really good at them...\n\nHere's my other link that I mentioned for further details: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6j5wx7/parents_and_i_arguing/?st=j4ko2fqz&amp;sh=c2970e16\n\nI hope this wasn't too long.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"depression","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqqf","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I feel like no one loves me","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6kkizd/i_feel_like_no_one_loves_me/","view_count":null}

I'm 22 years old, soon to be 23, and my mom got pregnant with me when she was 15 by a guy who wasn't worth shit.  I grew up with my mom for a short amount of time, but since she was still in high school, she was still able to receive support from my grandparents until she was able to be on her own. She worked a few minimum wage jobs while in high school, graduated on open campus, and eventually landed herself a long term job, which she still works now.  Maybe around the age of 4 or 5, a decision was made for me to live with my grandparents due to the fact that my mom wasn't particularly the best person to be around when she was younger. Her attitude was awful (maybe bordering on a type of verbal abuse), the environments I had to be in weren't the best, and I just generally wasn't a happy child when I was around her cause I would never know what type of mood she would be in each day.  \n\nSo, I've lived with my grandparents pretty much all my life. And while I'm extremely grateful to have had their help and guidance with growing into who I am now, I can't help but look back on the deep rooted underlying issues that I have because I didn't have a traditional upbringing.  I didn't really grow up with my mom long enough to have a normal relationship with her (I talk to her maybe once a week at most), my dad subjected me to numerous letdowns (missed birthdays, unanswered phone calls, random popups only to disappear again), and I just feel like I missed something crucial that I needed growing up.\n\nPeople think that once you have a baby (especially as a teenager) that the worst is over. Okay, the baby is here, now let's try to regain some semblance of a stable life. But what they fail to realize, is that for situations like that, where both parents are far too young to really understand what it is that they've done, that you have to be very sensitive with how you raise that child. If you can't provide the necessary physical, mental, and emotional tools to ensure that your child grows up feeling whole and not hollow, then you shouldn't even put yourself in a situation that would allow you to produce a child. It's also why I'm so against teen pregnancies and unprotected sex, because I know what it feels like to suffer the ripples of careless mistake. Even though I'm an adult, I still feel the impacts of that stupid decision to this day.\n\nMy mom has said to me before in some phone calls, \"I know you resent me for what I did and I'm sorry.\" And I know this might be selfish of me, but I'm so past an apology at this point. The damage was done the second you decided to do what you did. Of course though, I never say this to my mom, simply because I'm one of those people who's bottled up their emotions so much that I'm actually scared of just letting them out.  When she says stuff like that, I just brush off her comment with a casual \"Ahh don't worry about it. I don't resent you.\" But in my mind it's just like \"I blame you! This is all your fault! Your idiotic choices are why I feel the way I do.\" I could never say that to her though, because even though I'm so angry about how I feel, I know that saying those things to her would destroy her, and it just goes against my character to do that people. \n\nI know there's probably gonna be someone who says something like \"You can't let that define your life forever.\" But not everyone has the means to just patch something like that up and move on. You can mask it, sure, but the internal damage that's been done over the course of years is always gonna define you to an extent.

When I was depressed and suicidal, I told her and she got me psych help. When I realised I was bisexual, I told her and she was super supportive. So generally she's very supportive.\n\nI've had at least 3-4 straight out conversations with her over the past few years regarding me being CF, and also refer to that decision in other conversations (eg \"I'll be able to travel a lot since I won't be having kids\").\n\nShe is an intelligent, wise and open minded person, and she makes it clear that she'll support my decision. She says the right things like \"well if you never have children you'll still live a meaningful and happy life\" and \"I'll support you no matter what\".\nHowever she also says things that make me feel totally dismissed, like a little child who is having a tantrum.\n\"You don't know that\" is the worst one. This then leads on to \"you don't what what will be in the future, you could change your mind. You could meet a partner (I'm single) who wants children and you decide you'd like to have one with him. You dislike other people's children but you would love your own. You might meet a partner who already has a child, and that child could brighten up your life in ways you never expected, they could be an unexpected blessing\".\nThis then leads to me stating how I go out of my way to look only for CF people to date and that I refuse to date people who want children or already have children.\nThen she says things like \"you need to be open minded and accepting rather than out so many DealBreakers in place. You could miss the perfect partner for you because you have too many dealbreakers.\"\n\nThis then leads to me protesting that I'd rather be single than deliberately go out with a person I know wants/ has kids when I am so so so sure it's not for me.\nAnd I really honestly mean that. While I'd certainly like a partner to travel the world with and have fun with, I am an introvert who is quite happy spending huge amounts of time alone. I have plenty of hobbies and interests I'm perfectly capable of doing myself, and am planning a solo trip overseas to live and work for many months. My life doesn't suffer because I'm single, I'm perfectly content. \nBut my life absolutely would suffer if I somehow ended up with a child in it.\n\nSo basically  I don't know what to say to her! Basically she's saying she'll respect my decision but that I shouldn't Mage it now but rather stay open minded.\n\nThe most annoying part is, I'm 30! I feel like I'm not considered old enough or wise enough to make decisions. I also feel like my younger siblings are allowed to buy family sized homes and family cars because they want children- and they're considered able to make that decision without anyone saying \"you might change your mind\" and yet I'm not considered able to make a decision to NOT want kids. It's a decision I'm SO sure about that I'm currently pursuing a bilateral salpingectomy and ablation so I'm sterile and free from any risk of accidental pregnancy and the stress of an abortion.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"childfree","subreddit_id":"t5_2qtwb","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[DISCUSSION] I feel completely unsupported by a woman I consider my mother, who still doesn't accept or support me being CF.

I got home from work today, looked at my crappy bachelor apartment and just thought...this is it. My Mom wanted to destroy me, she wanted me to have a terrible life and now I do.\n\nI have let go of a lot of things but it really irks me that she is sitting in a 3 bedroom house with central air tonight, and I am here scraping by. She relied on me to pay bills when I was a teen, with what was essentially all of my babysitting money. Like bills up to and including rent some months. She never even tried to pay me back. She visited once in college, offered to take me out to dinner, and then pulled the old \"Oh! I forgot my wallet!\" so I would have to pay for it. Like that's the kind of person she is, she does things like that every time I see her.\n\nWhether it's a family thing or a recession thing, I can never get any traction savings-wise. I'm not married, I don't own anything, my job pays a little under $16/hour. When my landlord cashes my rent check for July, I will be back to being overdrawn again. I can't do roommates because I don't pick up on red flags. I'll end up living with a coke addict, or someone who dates creepy guys who were just released from prison, or some other weird situation. They have all been weird, even the roomies I got paired with in college were nightmare addicts with creepy dealers delivering at 2 AM etc. \n\nI just feel like it was so foolish to think I was going to get out, to get away and be successful. I am a PTSD mess. No matter how much therapy, meditation, 12-step work I do, I am still kind of regarded as a freak. I have a hard time making friends, and I basically have no friends who function well. I just don't know what the point is. It's never, ever going to get any better. \n\nI know life isn't fair, but this level of loneliness, desolation, anger...it's really awful. It's just not right.
