We have unofficially been together since September 2011 and officially been together as of the start of this month.  Unofficially meaning at the time we didn't put a title on it as we were in a relationship but acted as if we were.\nWe got together around a month after she broke up with her ex.  When we started \"dating\" a few months in I asked her what we were actually doing and she said she wasn't ready for a relationship and just liked how things were going.  I was fine with that as it meant I wasn't really tied down either.\nSo this went on until the start of this month and she turned around and said to me she wanted to make things official as she has grown pretty fond of me and developed feelings for me.  We spoke about her ex sitatuation as he would sometimes just call her and give her grief on the phone.  She eventually stopped taking the calls and blocked him.  But she said she still loved him (they were only together for a year) but she really liked me and wanted to see where things go.\nCut to last night where she calls me pretty upset saying how she really wants to be with me but feels guilty that she still has these feelings for her ex and doesn't understand why I would want to be with her knowing it as well.  I pretty much told her (speaking from a previous 5 year relationship) that I'm not going to be mad at her for the way she feels as she doesn't really have control over them.  But if she genuinely wants to be with me, see how things go between us and usually with time she won't have her feelings for her ex.  She agreed and was pretty happy that I spoke to her about it and was generally being nice about it.\nSo this is where it leaves me, do I still continue trying to work at this relationship or do I just tell her that she should probably be on her own.  I like the girl a lot and I like the think the feeling is mutual from what she has said which is what makes me think maybe I should just wait it out.

When we started &amp;quot;dating&amp;quot; a few months in I asked her what we were actually doing and she said she wasn&amp;#39;t ready for a relationship and just liked how things were going.  I was fine with that as it meant I wasn&amp;#39;t really tied down either.\nSo this went on until the start of this month and she turned around and said to me she wanted to make things official as she has grown pretty fond of me and developed feelings for me.  We spoke about her ex sitatuation as he would sometimes just call her and give her grief on the phone.  She eventually stopped taking the calls and blocked him.  But she said she still loved him (they were only together for a year) but she really liked me and wanted to see where things go.\nCut to last night where she calls me pretty upset saying how she really wants to be with me but feels guilty that she still has these feelings for her ex and doesn&amp;#39;t understand why I would want to be with her knowing it as well.  I pretty much told her (speaking from a previous 5 year relationship) that I&amp;#39;m not going to be mad at her for the way she feels as she doesn&amp;#39;t really have control over them.  But if she genuinely wants to be with me, see how things go between us and usually with time she won&amp;#39;t have her feelings for her ex.  She agreed and was pretty happy that I spoke to her about it and was generally being nice about it.\nSo this is where it leaves me, do I still continue trying to work at this relationship or do I just tell her that she should probably be on her own.  I like the girl a lot and I like the think the feeling is mutual from what she has said which is what makes me think maybe I should just wait it out.  People of Reddit, what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Girlfriend loves ex, not sure if I should continue trying or not&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1328131003,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

Fortunately, the deep cysts on my face never left any severe scarring. I have a few minor tear type scars on my chin. Ironically, I actually like the look of them. I doubt most people notice, but they kinda look like the harrison ford scar so in a weird way i like it. Unfortunately, my back suffered enumerably and are not cool scars. \n\nI went on accutane and it helped a lot overall with my face and back, but it was too late as my back had just too many. Up to that point, it had been a few years since it started. I started to get acne around 17. Did not get on accutane until 4-5 months before my 20th birthday. The reason why it took to long to get on accutane was because my mom and new doctor (both female no offense) were relucant. ANd then my mom quit her job which had inusrance for like a year in between so I could not get treatment. OUt of pocket accutane is like 500 a month. The most frustrating part is that my original doctor recommended it, but my mom shot it down becuase she \"heard\" bad things. She works in a pharmacy and remembers the bad experiences. However, only a small percentage of people ever suffer the negative side affects. Neverthelss, I got extremely unlucky missing out the first time and then again with the new (female) doctor. Yes, I went to two doctors and missed out. After my mom shot down accutane the first time, I got useless antibiotics. Then, after switching doctors, the new doctors prescribed more useless antibiotics. And then again with not having insurance for awhile. Finally, got on it when my dad got a new job (insurance). Went and saw a new doctor (female, you see im not sexist) who instantly prescribed me accutane.\n\nHowever, like I was saying. The scars were left and they are bad. I have tried for the past 6 months to heal them using steroid injections at the derm. I have noticed a difference. They are less pink now and lowered, but still very much there. They look better to me, but the average person would think that I had got no treatment at all, if that gives you an idea.\n\nMy problem is this. I really feel like this is holding me back. I have given it a good shot to heal them best I can. The last option is some hideously expensive laser surgery which I doubt it will be able to fix what I have. For the most part, I have accepted my fate. I don't really go through life thinking about how bad it sucks to have these scars, but it does pop in my mind occasionally. However, it I believe it has kept me back because the fear of people seeing has kept from doing things that I had always done. I do not like swimming or anything where I have to take my shirt off. \n\nThey may fade with time, who knows. But i need to be comfortable in my own skin. I also feels this holds me back with the ladies as I am afraid what they would say. Otherwise, i think most people say that I am a fairly decent looking guy. I have a profile on a dating site.

If anyone is familiar with the area they know how bad public transportation is in Santa Clarita. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my question is how do I get out of this rut? Most of the jobs I look for on craigslist or other job sites I am not qualified for but I know with some studying I could do web development or other programming. I feel like I need to go back to school but I have no idea how to do that. What should I do to get my life going? I have about $20 to my name right now and fortunately I don&amp;#39;t have any expenses at the moment. But time is running out and I am about to wear out my welcome here. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1328125966,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

She is a special girl but has some emotional issues ,  as we all do to different degrees. She professed her love to me so beautifully over and over and we met several times . After she finally moved here, she began exhibiting unusual behavior resembling something like Bi -polar or worse , turning small disagreements into major breakups and problems. I examined myself throughout all this time thinking I could be responsible or contributed . I am not perfect but my analysis is she projected her feelings into ordinary interactions causing constant problems. She was/is either very hot towards me or very cold. After a month of being together , she broke up with me over dubious reasoning. She is very attractive and pursued and found another man and started another sexual love affair, albeit short-lived.

I am 54 years old and live in the northeast while she lived in the south. She lost custody of her girl in her divorce and moved to my town while I attempt to relocate out of my home on the market. She is a special girl but has some emotional issues ,  as we all do to different degrees. She professed her love to me so beautifully over and over and we met several times . After she finally moved here, she began exhibiting unusual behavior resembling something like Bi -polar or worse , turning small disagreements into major breakups and problems. I examined myself throughout all this time thinking I could be responsible or contributed . I am not perfect but my analysis is she projected her feelings into ordinary interactions causing constant problems. She was/is either very hot towards me or very cold. After a month of being together , she broke up with me over dubious reasoning. She is very attractive and pursued and found another man and started another sexual love affair, albeit short-lived.

Again, thank you!!**\n\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI figured I'd post some of my responses from below and from PM's, for a bit more info that may, or may not be helpful:\n\n* I can usually cover my bills, but this month I got hit with a bad case strep, and I have no insurance.

I was going out to eat more then I should and not putting any time aside to exercise. One day while looking through recent photos I realized how fat my face looked to me and also noticed a belly that I had never had before. It was then that I knew I had to get back into shape. \n\nI figured I would share my progress pics and what I have done to achieve this so that it might inspire somebody to shed that extra lazy weight that you might have been putting on lately. I initially weighed 210 when I started my weight loss journey and 2 weeks into it I had lost 8 lbs and couldn't see a difference so I realized that I wanted to start taking photos each week to monitor my progress (thus the first photo was at 202lbs instead of my initial 210). *note: please disregard the horrible tattoo I decided to get when I was 18, yes I know it is bad.\n\nFor exercise I jump on my elliptical for 30 minutes each morning right when I wake up. It is nice to get the cardio done and out of the way and it helps wake me up and get me warmed up in the morning. I found it easier to make myself do it due to not having the excuse of being too tired to do it when I got home from a long day at work. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I will also lift weights in the evening focusing on different muscle groups each day (chest/triceps one day, back/biceps another, etc). I only have dumbbells so I find myself trying to find new exercises to incorporate them.\n\nAs for my nutrition I have not been eating any fast food, but instead cooking my meals where I can monitor my caloric intake better and regulate unnecessary butter and fats I consume. I make a list each week of what I will be making for dinner each night so that I can buy everything I need and not deviate from my schedule. For breakfast each morning I eat a bowl of oatmeal, a hard-boiled egg, and a cup of coffee. Lunch each day consists of a either a turkey sandwich with onions, tomato, and mustard on whole wheat bread. I also have a small snack between breakfast/lunch and between lunch/dinner which is usually a rice cake or these dehydrated fruit packs that I found in Costco. Based on what I am having for dinner that night I might lay off the between meal snacks to save the calories. One night a week is date night in which my girlfriend and I will go out to a restaurant and eat. I make sure not to go overboard with what I order but I certainly am not ordering a side salad. I also have limited my drinking to one night a week (usually on date night). Aside from my \"date night\" I always tried to eat 500 calories less then my BMR per day which I was hoping would net me a 1 lb loss per week. I wanted to lose it slow and steady so that I wouldn't feel too hungry or lose motivation due to an overly strict menu. Due to the cardio I was doing each morning it ended up making me shed about 1.5-2 pounds each week.\n\nJust for reference I am 6' tall and in my early 30s. I started at 210 lbs and now weight 171 lbs. \n\nI am satisfied with my results and never found myself having trouble keeping to this routine nor starving and feeling malnourished. I think the best advice I heard was from my girlfriend who told me that it took a few years to put on the weight so don't expect it to go away overnight. Each week I watched the weight slowly come off and now, 17 weeks later, I am back to a healthy weight and super glad I decided to lose it. I feel healthier, more energetic, and plan on continuing my eating and exercise habits because of how good I have been feeling lately. If anybody has any questions feel free to ask. \n\nGood luck with all of you and your weight loss goals!\n\n[PROGRESS PICS](http://i.imgur.com/Y5gZh.jpg)","domain":"self.loseit","num_comments":62,"likes":null,"clicked":false,"thumbnail":"self","saved":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rz8w","ups":222,"approved_by":null,"score":175,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of my current long term relationship I slowly was letting myself go.

It was then that I knew I had to get back into shape. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I figured I would share my progress pics and what I have done to achieve this so that it might inspire somebody to shed that extra lazy weight that you might have been putting on lately. I initially weighed 210 when I started my weight loss journey and 2 weeks into it I had lost 8 lbs and couldn&amp;#39;t see a difference so I realized that I wanted to start taking photos each week to monitor my progress (thus the first photo was at 202lbs instead of my initial 210). *note: please disregard the horrible tattoo I decided to get when I was 18, yes I know it is bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For exercise I jump on my elliptical for 30 minutes each morning right when I wake up. It is nice to get the cardio done and out of the way and it helps wake me up and get me warmed up in the morning. I found it easier to make myself do it due to not having the excuse of being too tired to do it when I got home from a long day at work. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I will also lift weights in the evening focusing on different muscle groups each day (chest/triceps one day, back/biceps another, etc). I only have dumbbells so I find myself trying to find new exercises to incorporate them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for my nutrition I have not been eating any fast food, but instead cooking my meals where I can monitor my caloric intake better and regulate unnecessary butter and fats I consume. I make a list each week of what I will be making for dinner each night so that I can buy everything I need and not deviate from my schedule. For breakfast each morning I eat a bowl of oatmeal, a hard-boiled egg, and a cup of coffee. Lunch each day consists of a either a turkey sandwich with onions, tomato, and mustard on whole wheat bread. I also have a small snack between breakfast/lunch and between lunch/dinner which is usually a rice cake or these dehydrated fruit packs that I found in Costco. Based on what I am having for dinner that night I might lay off the between meal snacks to save the calories. One night a week is date night in which my girlfriend and I will go out to a restaurant and eat. I make sure not to go overboard with what I order but I certainly am not ordering a side salad. I also have limited my drinking to one night a week (usually on date night). Aside from my &amp;quot;date night&amp;quot; I always tried to eat 500 calories less then my BMR per day which I was hoping would net me a 1 lb loss per week. I wanted to lose it slow and steady so that I wouldn&amp;#39;t feel too hungry or lose motivation due to an overly strict menu. Due to the cardio I was doing each morning it ended up making me shed about 1.5-2 pounds each week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just for reference I am 6&amp;#39; tall and in my early 30s. I started at 210 lbs and now weight 171 lbs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am satisfied with my results and never found myself having trouble keeping to this routine nor starving and feeling malnourished. I think the best advice I heard was from my girlfriend who told me that it took a few years to put on the weight so don&amp;#39;t expect it to go away overnight. Each week I watched the weight slowly come off and now, 17 weeks later, I am back to a healthy weight and super glad I decided to lose it. I feel healthier, more energetic, and plan on continuing my eating and exercise habits because of how good I have been feeling lately. If anybody has any questions feel free to ask. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck with all of you and your weight loss goals!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Y5gZh.jpg\"&gt;PROGRESS PICS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1328116419,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

I again get an overwhelming fear as I look around I see no door ways but crawlspaces formed under debri ( in some sort of never ending series of broken buildings) I get the urge to crawl as fast as possible into the tight spaces for the next 10 minutes I'm crawling while crying my eyes out only wishing to find an exit.
