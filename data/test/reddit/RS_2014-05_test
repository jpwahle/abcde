I am a bicurious guy and I have had submissive fantasies for several years now (pretty much as long as I remember). I am 23. I have only been in vanilla relationships with girls and they were always enjoyable, although even in sex I enjoyed being with someone I cared about more than the act. I have 0 interest towards one night experiences with girls. My fantasies were always about being submissive, but I didn't really hate the vanilla sex either.\n\nI am successful in my professional life and, while not the manliest man in the world, I am not a quiet mouse either. So I often feel conflicted and ashamed about my fantasies afterwards. I feel like I would get made fun of and trampled over in the real world if anyone knew. The same goes for being bi. Its somehow fucked up that I get turned on by thinking about being degraded when I am perfectly happy and proud about myself outside the bedroom.\n\nI am currently not in a relationship and have been thinking I should finally just go for it and get a sexdate online with some guy, but I am afraid what if someone finds out. What if he takes hidden pictures of me and posts them online, fucking up my life. I don't know any gay people and in general I don't really want to come out before trying is it even something I actually enjoy, or do I like just the fantasy, so its also kinda impossible to try to ease myself into it with a guy that I really trust.\n\nIf someone asked me this, I would just say go for it and enjoy life. If I don't enjoy the experience or afterwards feel bad, it's just life and I can then move on. But that's not as easy to do yourself when you are often ashamed just thinking about it. I am a successful young man, why do I feel excited about being a submissive when I am nothing like that professionally ?

After about a week of cream and suppositories, it burst and there was no more pain, but it grew back like the next day (which I guess happens when something bursts). Since then I haven't had any pain, and it's not as noticeable when I feel down there. However it's been so long that I don't notice any more, but I'm pretty sure it is still very much there.\n\nI did use some cream every night to try and shrink it, but it seems to just keep coming back. Like, it would go down to a fairly unnoticeable size and then the next day I'd pass a stool and it would be back. I changed my diet to have more fibre and water as well.\n\nAnyway, to get to my point: this is really embarrassing to have at 17. The cream doesn't seem to be a very good solution so I am thinking of getting it surgically removed.\n\nBecause of the hemorrhoid, I haven't had sex in a few months and I'm scared of what a guy would think if I have it. If you're a top/vers, would it be off-putting to you? \n\nAlso, I'm wondering about what happens with treatment. The doctor said that the cream should reduce it to a minimal size but there will still be a bit of extra skin there. I don't like the idea of that; if a guy is fucking me I think my butt wouldn't be good with that.\nI've also been told that having surgery would leave a small scar. This sounds a lot better, but I've done a bit of reading and apparently there is a risk of the anus being damaged after the surgery.\n\nBasically, I don't know what to do. Is a hemorrhoid an issue? The idea of it being there in sex freaks me out, and I don't want to have sex until it's gone. It's also really embarrassing to have when I'm only 17.\n\nWhat should I do about it? I really don't know. I understand that once you have them, you pretty much are going to have them forever in some way or another, which is just depressing. Maybe I've got this whole thing wrong; I don't know.\n\nSorry for the ramble, this post was really poorly written. Any advice about either sex with hemorrhoids or hemorrhoids themself would be really appreciated! &lt;3\n\nOh and a final thing: since having this problem, I am needing to do a number 2 much more often. It used to be once every day or two; now it is 2-3 times a day. I don't know what this is due to but it seems unlikely to be a coincidence. It makes me think that I'm not getting everything out each time I go to the loo, if you will - which also has me worried: if there's a load of poo being stored up there, is that going to be a problem when having sex?","media":null}

Bipolar II here! So I've been feeling pretty useless in life lately, even when I'm not depressed. I feel like my meds are working fine (not sad or anything) but that I myself have a fundamental issue with being a functional member of society. I think it's because of this weird procrastination issue I have and I was wondering if this affects anyone else, if it's a bipolar thing, and how I can try fixing it. I'll explain it more because I don't think 'procrastination' totally covers it.\n\nIt's kind of like whenever I need to do something (work, clean up, shower, brush my teeth, take meds) or even when I kind of want to do something that might be enjoyable (write or bake or even eat) I get this weird mental block. It's almost as if my entire mind and body reject that idea. I'll put it off for ever, and might not even do it in the end. It doesn't feel like procrastinating; it feels like staring at a giant wall. I don't feel like a bad person but I feel like functioning in these ways and moving forward in life is like flying like a bird... just not possible. \n\nThis 'fact' of not being able to do things makes me feel so stuck and frozen in a world that's constantly moving forward. I'm 19 and at a point that I actually need to take steps forward in life. This 'procrastination' makes me feel so shitty about myself and really hopeless about life that I've OD'd a couple times - even when I wasn't sad. I just felt like that was the only choice.\n\nI just had to take a year and a half off of college because of not doing work and I haven't made much progress to go back. I guess I'm really just scared about my future or lack thereof. Right now, I'm literally doing nothing with my life, just sitting at home and learning to drive. Not even depressed (except sometimes situationally due to being away from friends and at home)\n\nDoes anyone else have this same feeling and problem and can give advice of any kind? Really, anything would be great to hear. Even personal experiences. That would be super validating.\n\nOh and fyi, I'm on lithium, lamictal, and a low dose of strattera.\n\nThanks!","media":null,"ups":8,"retrieved_on":1441556679,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/BipolarReddit/comments/24ezd4/feeling_like_im_literally_unable_to_do_anything/","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Feeling like I'm literally unable to do anything (mind block)","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1398904536","subreddit":"BipolarReddit","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.BipolarReddit"}

I am 19 and in a monogamous LTR. I was mostly interested in Nexplanon, but they don't insert those at my university clinic. I had my annual gynecological exam today and mentioned that I was interested in learning more about IUDs. My provider was happy to give me the literature for Paraguard, Mirena, and Nexplanon. I've seen a lot of testimonials from the ladies here on Reddit as well.\n\nSince I expressed interest in it, my provider went ahead and completed an STI test for me, since it is required for IUD placement. As I was checking out, though, the secretary asked if I wanted to go ahead and get my pre-IUD consultation out of the way. I had time, so why not?\n\nI talked with another nurse about exactly what the procedure involves and what to expect. She told me about when to come in, what kind of drugs to take, all that jazz. Honestly, this worried me more than comforted me. My clinic will not prescribe Cytotec (the cervix softening drug). They will also not prescribe any kind of pain medication. I am the BIGGEST WEENIE. I get extreme motion sickness and I can't even have blood drawn without feeling dizzy and clammy. Might I mention that they want to do this next Tuesday, right before finals?\n\nOverall, I'm just feeling very nervous about the whole thing. Just thinking about the procedure makes me want to vomit and cry. My friend (also 19) had Mirena placed as well, and not one week later, had it expel itself. Is there any kind of advice you ladies could offer? How was your IUD experience?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your experiences and responses. I have decided against the procedure, at least for the time being. I am not prepared to do this, especially right before finals.

I'll start off with a little background. I'm 6'1'', 225lbs, 30-years-old. I've been an athlete since childhood and weight lifter since high school.\n\nAbout 3 years ago I was doing p90x and was in the best shape of my life at a ripped and strong 180. \n\nWith depression, laziness and drinking I got all the way up to 237. Now my current 225 is about 6 months of 2-4 day a week weight lifting sessions and cardio. I've put back on most of the muscle if not more than I had 6 months ago at 237 so I assume I've lost more than 12 pounds of fat.\n\nMy good weeks are an \"Arnold\"/My Lifting buddy style workout that has worked a lot for me. Monday: Chest/abs Tuesday: Back/lower back. Wednesday: Legs/Shoulders/abs. Thursday: Chest/Back (light). Friday: Bis/tris. Saturday: Legs/shoulders. Sunday: Not shit.\n\nThis is a perfect week, and very rare. My weeks are mostly - Monday:  Hungover from the weekend. Tuesday: Chest/Back. Wednesday: Legs. Thursday: Shoulders. Friday: Try to get to the gym before work for arms, but doubtful and no way in hell I'm going after work on a Friday. Saturday: Band practice or BWW/Sporting event all including drinking and video games. Sunday: Same (and just a bender during football season). Repeat.\n\nFirst off I know I'm robbing myself blind of gains by drinking and not fully committing but I have lost a bunch of weight and gained a bunch of muscle. Other than this my nutrition is still pretty good.\n\nAnyway. I can not bench.\n\nI had a ripped and strong chest back in the day but that's gone now. Although my legs, arms, and shoulders are almost back to good; my chest is not great. I have borderline moobs.\n\nMy benching has ALWAYS been awful. I can workout every thing else amazingly without issue. I've worked for years on form, different angles, weights. More weight - less reps. Less weight - high reps. nothing works except for gains from stupid shit like smith pressing, and wide press machines. As well as, standard push-ups (p90x).\n\nI'm strong. I can bench a lot of \"weight\" but I feel it's all shoulders, lats, and tris. The WORST thing is that when my form feels good, I get a good pump, have a decent workout I notice next to NO soreness the next days(s). As well as, no gains. I'm doing something wrong and I need advice.\n\n**TL;DR** - I've sucked at bench for years. The only thing that has worked is push-ups (p90x), smith pressing, and wide press machines.

I never did figure out how to post photos. \n\nI'm cautiously optimistic at this point. I feel like I have a long way to go before I'll feel safe believing I'm really going to have a baby in January.

This one will be due January 9th so maybe we'll just have one crazy birthday week in our family. \n\nI wanted to thank everyone here for being a huge support over the past few months.

I suppose I should also mention that I'm 16, live in the red-neck part of Florida, and am still financially dependent on my parents.  \n***\nSo about two weeks ago I came out of the closet to my parents. It wasn't something I had wanted to do (my plan was to wait until I had gotten far, far way from them and then spill the beans) but the way things went I didn't have a choice.   \nSo my parents are watching the news, and some story about teen pregnancies comes on. My parents are shocked by this, and that night at dinner they bring up the news story. Basically, they asked if I was having sex with the girlfriend they thought I had. (I have never mentioned having a girlfriend, they kind of assumed.)  \nSo a little red light goes off in my head, and I rapidly try to kill this part of the conversation. \"Oh, you don't have to worry about that,\" I said, and chuckled weakly. \"I wouldn't ... I'm not going to be getting anyone pregnant anytime soon.\"  \nAs soon as I said this I realized that they would latch on to something like that. They did. Immediately they question me on what I mean by that ( I tried to pass it off as \"Uhh...I'm ugly?\" but they didn't fall for it) and I realize that I am approaching the Danger Zone. So now I try backpedaling furiously and try to escape the conversation: I don't want to talk right now, I'm suddenly not feeling well, can we do this some other time, etc etc. But all that does is make it more obvious that I'm hiding something.  \nAnd so now I realize that sooner or later, I'm going to have to tell them. So I figure, why not now?  \nSo I told them everything. How I was gay, how I had been for a while, how I had zero interest in girls, how I wasn't really sure what to believe in anymore. And I expected them to react negatively, but I didn't really expect them to react how they did.  \nThey flat-out denied that it was possible for me to be gay. They said I was \"confused\" and that I only thought I was gay because I had never had a girlfriend. The next day they went about their normal business. Didn't even mention it, and they still haven't.    \n  \n\n**TL;DR** Came out to my parents. They didn't believe me. Am essentially still in the closet. \n  \nSo now I have literally no idea what to do. Do I act like nothing happened? Do I affirm to them that I am actually gay? I'm totally stumped here.\n","retrieved_on":1441556646,"ups":28,"subreddit":"LGBTeens","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":"Fabulous in Florida","created_utc":"1398906301","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.LGBTeens","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Came out to my parents, parents essentially re-closeted me.

Last time I posted I got a ton of upvotes and lots of comments and discussion (thanks everyone!)  I also got a couple of responses that will hopefully pan out in the future but they're in a holding pattern for right now.  I'd really like to cut some hair so give my post a read, hopefully give it an upvote, and if you're interested then shoot me a message.  Feel free to also comment or message if you just have any questions. Thanks!  \n\nI have a fetish for women's hair. This includes styling, brushing, washing, curling, playing with, and most of all cutting. \n\nIt's been quite some time since I've been fortunate enough to cut some hair as the last time was about 4 months ago when a fwb asked me to do her hair and she got a short pixie with the side of her head buzzed.  She loved it and keeps it cut that way to this day. \n\nOther than the fetish, I'm 5'9\",  in good shape and work out on a regular basis,  a gentleman at my core but definitely capable of  a dominant role (and quite good at it)  if the situation calls for it.  I have an amazing ginger beard if you're into that sort of thing and my skills in bed are quite fantastic(or so I'm told) \n\nWhat I'd like from you is a willingness to have your hair cut; whether it's just a trim, a long to short (my favorite), or even a full head shave.  Ideally you'd be down for things to get sexual afterwards as cutting hair really turns me on.  If you're not interested in the sex, then that's more than ok, I can still do your hair for you.\n\nYou'll get a complete makeover, additional cleanup and services at a salon (provided by me)  if you're looking for something a bit outside of my abilities,  new clothes to fit the cut if necessary,  and the possibility of attending events (premieres, screenings, etc)  with me so I can show you off.  \n\nIf you're interested then message me with a picture and a little bit about yourself.   I can  then send you photos of past cuts I've done if you would like. We'll chat for a bit and meet up somewhere for coffee before hand, that way you're comfortable and know that this is all above board.  \n\nTldr;I want to cut your hair, Make you look like a million bucks, then hopefully have a little fun.\n\n","retrieved_on":1441556646,"ups":0,"permalink":"/r/r4r/comments/24f238/25_m4f_los_angeles_i_want_to_cut_your_hair/","link_flair_text":"M4F"}

We usually see each other during lunch when we bring food and eat together. The co-worker I had the fight with, lets call him \"D\" is 23 and the other friend is \"K\" 29. I am 33.\n\nIt all started on Monday. I had arranged to get lunch with other co-workers that day and since \"D\" didn't ask me if I brought lunch, I messaged him saying, \"i'm going out to lunch with a co-worker\" and left for lunch. Upon returning, I see that \"D\" messaged me back and he wrote,   \n\n\"oh\ni didn't bring lunch  \nwhere r u guys going?  \nwho's ur coworker?  \n?........  \njust ditch me like this..  \nf u\"\n\nReading this, I was obviously stunned and offended that he would say something like this to a good friend of his. But since he has a history of being ultra sensitive at people ignoring him or putting him down for his age, I didn't respond to him thinking that he'll cool down by tomorrow so I can talk to him about it.\n\nSo, yesterday when we met up for lunch, I began asking him why he was so mad at me and that his message to me was very inappropriate and offensive. To my surprise, he was still angry at me and because he was getting too heated, we took it outside. \nOnce outside, he explained to me that he felt that I ignored his message and that he felt unjust that I left him to eat lunch alone when we always ate together. I tried explaining him that I didn't see his messages till I got back and that he shouldn't expect me to eat lunch with him everyday but he was not listening to me at all.\n\nI tried apologizing and asked him if we can have closure but he wasn't having it. He then went on for minutes lecturing me on how selfish I am by listing all the grudges he's had against me. As you can tell, all of what he said was self-centered to him and ridiculous. One of them being that calling him to ask to be picked up from the airport was selfish of me.\n\nAfter what it seemed like hours of him lecturing at me, I blew up accidentally. Then I calmed down and once he was done insulting me, he had cooled down. Since I work with this guy, I initiated a hug off and we ended at that.\n\nTo recap, he never apologized for his attitude and now is messaging and talking to me like nothing happened.\n\nNow, I really want to keep my distance from an immature and volatile person like him, but knowing that how I could help with God, it's hard to cut him out of my life. I also have to watch out for my sake because I don't want to have any enemies. I know that if I keep a distance, he'll continue contorting our story to his advantage to other people around him.\n\nSo, how do you guys think I should deal with this? If anyone can relate to how he's feeling, your comments would be great to hear.\n\nThanks!\n\nTL:DR Co-worker 10 years younger than me was hurt that I left him to have lunch with another co-worker and messaged me \"f u\" and never apologized and admitted his fault.\n\n","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/Christianity/comments/24f3ik/had_a_huge_fight_with_an_immature_coworker/","is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"[deleted]","name":"t3_24f3ik","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"archived":true,"id":"24f3ik","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":5,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"edited":1398922289,"score":1,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/24f3ik/had_a_huge_fight_with_an_immature_coworker/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh6c","created":1398910876}

Not faking it, but not actually ill either, just subject to some sort of free-floating placebo effect? I don't understand why he thought that, or how he even got that idea. I've tried asking him about it but he doesn't remember ever using that word. He remembers very few things about my childhood, actually, but that's another story. \n\nHas this happened to anyone else? I'm not sure if I'd call my Dad an enabler or not; but he's certainly the biggest pushover you've ever met. \"Keep your head down\" is his motto. He's literally never stood up for anyone, ever. Could him never believing I was sick have something to do with that?\n\nWhen Mom got pulled over by a traffic cop once for not wearing her seatbelt and Dad was in the passenger seat, the cop didn't even get the chance to say, \"License and registration, please\" before Dad started apologizing profusely to the cop and saying, \"I told her to wear her seatbelt! I told her not to speed!\"\n\nSome drunk guy was harassing Mom at a party years ago, and she was walking away from him and towards Dad. The drunk guy followed her, and then got angry and grabbed ahold of her. Dad's reaction? He literally ran from the room. \n\nWhen I was in 7th grade I had a math teacher who barely spoke English and was just always angry at everyone. In the middle of class someone threw a wad of paper at my head, and I turned around and said, \"Who threw that?\" And the teacher got mad at ME, because she thought I had called everyone in the class names or something...and Dad believed her, rather than me. I could give a hundred more examples, but you get the idea.\n\nHe always took the side of whoever was in a position of authority, being a pushover and all. But that doesn't really explain why he never believed I was sick...is that an enabler thing or what? Sorry for the long post, but I haven't thought about any of this in a while and I'm just trying to understand it.

I start with 20 pound free weight, and do 15 reps of those twice. (not the best with workout 'vocab' like reps and sets and all different types of work outs.) I then get the bar, with usually 60 pounds on it and curl it 10-12 times.. I then do 10 chin ups. I sometimes do this whole routine twice, and I know this isn't getting me any where. \n\nI have a little bit of anxiety about going to the gym for the first time. I'm not the biggest guy and I know it, I guess I just don't want everyone else to?

Although I don't live with him and never have (drug problems in the past), I still see him once or twice a year.  The thing is, these visits are usually occupied by his ramblings about the Illuminati, the NWO, chemtrails, the poison in modern food etc etc.  He's also convinced he's allergic to any form of microwave or radio signal, and will often try to explain how his 'inner chakra' is distorted by modern technologies such as Wifi, telecommunications or tv-signals.  \n\nIt got ridiculous when I told him that I had decided to study politics at university in the fall, as he basically saw that as the \"Establishment having gotten to his son\".  He got quite angry and upset, and made me \"promise\" not to accept the \"chip\" that they install in every politician/civil servant in every Western government (cause you know, they're all mind-controlled by alien reptiles apparently...).  It basically sucked any joy of telling him what I wanted to study out of it.  \n\nHe's had drug problems in the past, essentially being excluded from his family because of it (Which impacted me, I never met my father's side of the family until I was around 5).  My aunt, the head of a local hospital and writer for a Norwegian medical paper, claims that it's a case of him having had a severe drug-induced psychosis which has made his lose touch with any sense of conventional reality.\n\nAlthough it might seem like the best thing to do would be to just cut him off and cease all communications with him (I'm 21 now), I still feel bad for the guy.  I'm his only child and he's never been in a stable relationship since my mother (they broke up when I was born), as well as the fact that his relationship with his family isn't that great.  I wish there was a way for him to move on from all this conspiratard bullshit that keeps his mind preoccupied all the time, but thus far any criticism I have shown has been met with anger and the worst look I've ever gotten.  \n\nIs there any hope for my poor old man?

I know this topic gets posted often, because I've been keeping an eye on it, so feel free to roll your eyes at my boring repetitive technical question. \n\n\n\n\n","retrieved_on":1441556540,"ups":5,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"editors","created_utc":"1398911641","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.editors","hide_score":false,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","title":"That question everybody hates/loves: picking a pre-built workstation vs. building one.","secure_media_embed":{}}

I'm sorry if this is not the correct sub.\n\nI was diagnosed with PCOS about 6 or 7 years ago (I am 22 now, if that is relevant). Since diagnosis, I have been taking Metformin, Spironolactone, and a birth control pill (currently Yasmin). I have always dealt with somewhat severe mood swings. Recently I have had a lot of stress in my life and my mood swings got so bad that I decided to see a counselor at my university for fear that I may have a mental health issue. After meeting with the counselor, major mental health problems (bi-polar, mania, even depression) have been pretty much ruled out (yay!). However, when I told her what medications I am taking she said she thinks it may all be related to a hormone problem caused by one of my meds. I had all but forgotten, but when I was about 16 my endocrinologist put me on some birth control (I don't remember the name anymore) that made me extremely irritable and we changed it because of that. Long story short, I am just curious if anyone on here has had similar issues or know a better medication combination I should talk to my doctor about? It is going to be awhile before I can get an appointment with him, so I was hoping to have some options to bring to him at that time.\n\nTL;DR: Looking for suggestions or help with my severe mood swings while on Metformin, Spironolactone, and Yasmin.\n\nThank you all!","permalink":"/r/PCOS/comments/24fabs/mood_swings/","link_flair_text":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Mood swings...","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"default","downs":0,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.PCOS","subreddit":"PCOS","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1398911776"}

Last time I posted I got a ton of upvotes and lots of comments and discussion (thanks everyone!)  I also got a couple of responses that will hopefully pan out in the future but they're in a holding pattern for right now.  I'd really like to cut some hair so give my post a read, hopefully give it an upvote, and if you're interested then shoot me a message.  Feel free to also comment or message if you just have any questions. Thanks!  \n\nI have a fetish for women's hair. This includes styling, brushing, washing, curling, playing with, and most of all cutting. \n\nIt's been quite some time since I've been fortunate enough to cut some hair as the last time was about 4 months ago when a fwb asked me to do her hair and she got a short pixie with the side of her head buzzed.  She loved it and keeps it cut that way to this day. \n\nOther than the fetish, I'm 5'9\",  in good shape and work out on a regular basis,  a gentleman at my core but definitely capable of  a dominant role (and quite good at it)  if the situation calls for it.  I have an amazing ginger beard if you're into that sort of thing and my skills in bed are quite fantastic(or so I'm told) \n\nWhat I'd like from you is a willingness to have your hair cut; whether it's just a trim, a long to short (my favorite), or even a full head shave.  Ideally you'd be down for things to get sexual afterwards as cutting hair really turns me on.  If you're not interested in the sex, then that's more than ok, I can still do your hair for you.\n\nYou'll get a complete makeover, additional cleanup and services at a salon (provided by me)  if you're looking for something a bit outside of my abilities,  new clothes to fit the cut if necessary,  and the possibility of attending events (premieres, screenings, etc)  with me so I can show you off.  \n\nIf you're interested then message me with a picture and a little bit about yourself.   I can  then send you photos of past cuts I've done if you would like. We'll chat for a bit and meet up somewhere for coffee before hand, that way you're comfortable and know that this is all above board.  \n\nTldr;I want to cut your hair, Make you look like a million bucks, then hopefully have a little fun."}

I'm 22 weeks and recently I found a pink stretch mark on my hip/side (I have tons from puberty and this new one decided to start off from an old one). \n\nI've always hated the stretch marks on my breasts, the size of my areolas.  The shape of my hips, the little pouch of fat at the bottom of my abdomen. My weight has fluctuated in my 20's, much to my horror, after having a slim and fit figure as a teen and during my early 20's.\n\nBut now, I love my bump. Knowing my child is growing inside it, I can accept it. My breasts? I can't even look at them. They're getting so heavy, their shape is changing, my areolas are gigantic compared to what I'm used to seeing. I feel so **wide** and massive, so hefty and awkward. I bump into things. My thighs rub together when I walk and I feel like all my nightmares about my body image have been coming true more quickly than I can take it. \n\nHow do you come to terms with this body, now changed by a totally normal and natural process? It doesn't feel like my body. It's so hard to feel pretty. What does it take to come to terms with it?\n\nWhen I see other pregnant bodies, I marvel at their curvature.

I have never had sex but I had several K-closes. Some HB6 had even insane crushes on me. Almost every single girl, that didn't want to proceed further into the relationship (so uhm ... friendzone?), told me she wants to keep me in her life. Maybe it's cause I'm quite talkative, also friendly and I can easy relate with most of the girls - basically  people - I meet. So talking isn't really the problem here, sometimes I talk about the craziest shit with them. The problem might only be in presentation - the tone, assertivness, sometimes even flirting. But at times I am socially awkward, like \"hate the world and not interested in anyone at all\" attitude.   \n\n\n*But the fuckin' question of the day is* ... why am I not excited in meeting new women and trying to get laid or something. Most of the times I just wanna do, you know, my own thing and I basically don't give a shit what other people think of me.

I have over 1000 hours, I practice at least two hours a day, but I can't seem to get better. I study games, demos, pratice recoil control, onetaps, spraying, bot dm, real dm, aim maps, training_aim_csgo, nothing seems to work. My aim is still awful. It's great against non-shooting bots, and it makes me feel like a pro, but when I go against players in DM or games, I can't shoot for shit. And it's not them beating me, its me beating myself. My sense feels different, I lose my precision, I have no confidence, and I miss. Badly. And I know I can do better.\n\nAnd I have no confidence. Weeks of dieing, missing easy kills and getting yelled at by teammates has basically removed any confidence or eagerness to get frags, and I am actually kind of scared of dueling in games now, because I know I am going to lose 75% of the time. On the training_aim_map, the one Friberg did a video on, my average score is 55/100 (Friberg's average was around 85/100). I can't flick shots, and I flub up the ones I take slowly. (400dpi, 6/11, 3.0 maccel off)\n\nI get so frustrated playing scrims and games, every night I go to bed angry and frustrated at my performance. The only thing keeping me playing is my will to succeed, and to not be beat by this game. \n\nThis is not meant to be a plea for sympathy, or anything like that. I just want some cold hard answers from some experienced players. I am so frustrated right now, and I need something to focus on. Because whatever I am doing right now is not working:\n\nDo you feel like your sense is off sometimes? I switched to my current sense about 2 weeks ago, and just yesterday it felt slow and foreign, and today it felt really fast. Is this something that happens to you?\n\nHow do you calm down in a game and take careful, planned shots? Sometimes I just panic and tap wildly, or spray wildly, but that never really works.\n\nI aim with my wrist mostly, while moving my forearm around as well. Is this ok, or should I keep my wrist planted?\n\nI seem to overshoot my shots more then anything. If I am 10 degrees from a player, I flick 15, then back 5 to get on target. Don't tell me to lower my sense, because I do the same thing with lower senses. What is causing this? This is why I do 55/100 on training_aim_csgo.\n\n I have good crosshair placement, but usually if a player walks into my crosshair, instead of clicking, I flick my crosshair a bit, and miss. How can I fix this?\n\nI always seem to fail at close range. My crosshair is on the guy, but it's like he moves between shots and I have to lead him a bit? Is this true?\n\nI am a really good awper, always have been, so my poor performance is really confusing to me.\n\nThanks for any help you can give me guys.

He's a musician. Has his own punk rock band and he's very involved with the punk rock scene. He's nice at times, critical at others. He has his perks and he has his downfalls. I'm not perfect either, but as time has progressed, I've found the relationship more stressful than anything else.\n\nHe doesn't treat me the same anymore. In the first 10 months of our relationship, he was so nice and thoughtful. He was very verbal affirmative and always really took part in listening and active conversations. He went out his way to text/call or ask how I was doing. His band became really popular at the ten month mark, too. So either the honeymoon period wore off or his music blinded his vision of our relationship completely.\n\nNow, he treats me with little respect. He's always grouchy or bitching about something. A normal day is filled with little comments like, \"I can't beat this level in a video game!\" \"Oh get over yourself!\" \"My iPad is dying because I've been using Garage Band all day!\" \"My band mates and I have conflicting schedules.\" \"You don't understand these bands enough to wear the shirt.\" \"No, that's not what the lyrics mean.\" \"Don't act like a drama queen.\" \"Stop complaining.\" \"Oh, you poor thing, the sole of your shoe ripped. Please, I have shoes in worse condition than that.\" \"Oh please.\" \"Oh please.\" \"Oh please.\"\n\nThat's his comment to basically everything now. \"OH PLEASE.\" It's getting tiring of hearing. I will say one little thing about my perspective on things or something about myself and he will mock me and pretend like I am going to crumble on the inside from this \"heart wrenching\" problem. Even if it's me just saying, \"My backpack is unusually heavy today.\" \n\nI am not a punk rocker. I am 5 foot even and 110 pounds. I have no desire to jump into a mosh pit with men who tower over me and are a million weight classes above me. I usually stand off to the side and just watch the band. Peter jumps into the mosh pit and he has a lot of fun, but he's 5'10 and close to 190 pounds, so he has it under control. He often puts me down over it and tells me I'm \"a pussy\" or a \"spoilsport\" because I won't get into a mosh pit. (And I have gotten into a mosh pit with him. And it was extreme. The first mosh pit I was ever was in was a mosh pit at a Bad Religion concert with men well in their 30's and 40's. I got punched in the face, never again, thanks.) I try to explain my reasoning to him but he says, \"You're just not a punk.\" But I agree to that. I enjoy punk music. I love Bad Religion, Bad Brains, Sex Pistols, The Clash, Crass, Dead Kennedy's, The Ramones, and pre-American Idiot Green Day. I just don't want to live the life style, which he always holds to me.\n\nAlso, I am not great friends with too many people in the punk scene. I am only friends with Peter's band mates. All the other people won't stick around long for a conversation with me and Peter *always* leaves me to stand by myself. I will jump into groups but they all migrate away from me. A lot of these people in the scene are high school drop outs with funky colored hair, ratty vests, stud belts, and tattoos covering their bodies. I just have a normal hair color with a simple part and I just wear band shirts and jeans. So when Peter runs off without me, I'll follow him, but get ignored while he talks to somebody else. He won't even give me room to get into the conversation. It's like he purposely blocks me out. It was past my curfew and I had to drive him home still and he made me wait 55 minutes after my curfew to go home because he was talking to everybody. I sat out in my car for fucking 55 minutes. I almost left him, but when he came, he bitched at me for being anti social.\n\nHe hates everything I do, it feels like. He thinks it's dumb that I read and write fanatically, he thinks it's stupid I play the Sims, he hates the Final Fantasy series, he hates Halo 3, my favorite Halo, but likes the rest, he hates the Fable series, and he thinks I'm stereotypical because I bought a Vera Bradley backpack for myself to easily transport my laptop places. I just feel like I cannot win!\n\nHe calls me a spoiled brat all the time. Yes, I'm spoiled. A brat? I don't think so. I don't feel comfortable describing my parents financial standing with anybody because it's nobodies business what my parents make, nor do I brag about all the cool things I have. And I know I have a lot of cool things. Peter however goes around claiming how poor his family is even though they own three acoustic guitars, he has a Les Paul Junior guitar, and a Strata-caster, a bigger TV than what I have in my room, a nice Toshiba laptop, a Samsung smartphone, and his parents also gave him a car (that he has to tune up a bit.) And he calls me a spoiled brat because my dad used my free upgrade to buy me the new Samsung Galaxy S5, I have an Alienware laptop, my parents gave me a 2001 Honda Civic that didn't need fixing up, and I'm always ordering new books for myself.\n\nHe is *NEVER* in the mood to talk with me. Out of school, he will talk a bit more than in school. In school, he walks around like he has been imprisoned in Auschwitz. He is constantly heaving heavy sighs, won't reply to me, and when he does reply to me he is bitching me out or putting me down, or he just goes silent the whole day with his music in and the world out. It's tiring. And then he gets pissed when I walk ahead of him because most of the time, he's just slugging behind, and I feel bad when I cause a traffic jam in the hallway. I think it's pointless that he wants to yell at me for walking ahead when he won't engage in conversation or hold my hand if I'm walking beside him.\n\nNow, I KNOW this relationship is borderline toxic. It clouds my mind a lot and I find myself a lot more angry and sad than usual. I have never broken up with somebody and want to do it as gracefully and as tactfully as possible. I want to do it in person, but as for what to say, I am at a loss. I don't want to blame it all on him, but I want to avoid cliches like \"It's not you, it's me.\" I want to be sure to be clear about why this is happening and that it's really over.

After working with my psychiatrist and therapist, turns out that I've been experiencing this since very early childhood. I am also unfortunate enough to experience psychosis at both ends of the spectrum, not just mania. And I've experienced it many, many, many times.\n\nCurrently, I'm on 450 mg of Trileptal and 100 mg of Lamictal, 0.25 of Xanax, and 40 mg of Adderall. While this has been working well for the past several months, there are some things that still happen and probably shouldn't. I still experience some psychotic features, namely persecutory delusions that interfere with my ability to function. I'm still very much limited to my house. I don't like going out in public for long periods of time and I can't be alone. I have to have someone with me to feel safe.\n\nI also experience mild hallucinations, mostly auditory. Oftentimes it's an external ringing or buzzing sound. Sometimes they get more complex and sound like someone is watching TV in the other room (when nobody is, of course). I sometimes see visual hallucinations, bright orbs of light that appear out of nowhere and disappear just as quickly or moving shadows.\n\nHave any of you guys experienced something like this?

I'll list a little bit about myself and what I'm looking for and hopefully by the end of my spiel I will have convinced the right person to message me.\n\nAbout me.  I am a well travelled and intelligent man who is currently living in Alberta, Canada.  I have been to 16 countries and have plans to travel to more.  I graduated a few years ago with a major in history and a minor in philosophy, so a lot of my education was inspired by travelling and now my education returns the favour.  Currently I'm self employed as an artist and photographer.  I also am heavily interested in music as I sing and play guitar, piano, bass, violin, and a few others a little less proficiently.  I listen to a lot of music as well, mainly indie rock to folk, Frightened Rabbit, Manchester Orchestra, Silversun Pickups, Incubus, Greg Laswell.  But I listen to a lot of other stuff and play a wide variety as well.  I enjoy art and culture, cooking, and the outdoors.  I'm very handy and have a heavy industrial background so I'm kind of a jack of all trades.  One thing I am not is material.  I really believe this life is about the stories you make and the experiences, not the things you own.  Not to say I don't like being comfortable, but I would rather be happy and make 25k a year than miserable at 150k.  [This](http://i.imgur.com/8FEDREa.jpg) is me in the redwoods a couple weeks ago on a 6000km road trip I took :).  I am 5'10\", bearded, short hair, honest, versatile, and am looking for the following:\n\nI'm looking for somebody who is open and interesting.  Intelligence is a huge thing for me, as well as maturity.  If you can go to an art gallery, hit up a pub, and grab some fresh ingredients to make dinner and collapse on the couch, we might just hit it off.  I can act like a complete idiot as well so if you have a great sense of humour that's a plus.  I like hiking and camping so you should probably be comfortable with that, as well as travelling.  Location isn't a huge issue but you should looking to meet at some point.  Somebody who isn't about drama, or keeping up with the Jones' and is more about finding a partner to bring the best out in each other.  So if that's you, then I hope you message me.

{"ups":51,"retrieved_on":1441556472,"selftext":"I think it's important to retool the word failure to success.  All the cries you hear after the viewings of the documentary are whimsical clamorings that I would argue to be sourced from the mindset of consumerism.  In other words, people just want to see badass shit and be onto the next badass spectacle.  This post will contain spoilers throughout.  That was your warning.\n\nSpoilers for those that haven't seen the film.  I recommend you see it, and I insist you see it in order to participate in this discussion.  Jodorowsky changed the ending of the picture.  Jodorowsky has an incredible imagination and belief in his projects that inspires others to his cause.  His earlier films are understood to be very unique.  I think that by using Dune as a tool to stay focused and not tangent into the wide expanse of the human psyche, any moments when he does stray from the source structure, he is forced to return.  This is true throughout his many changes until the culminating ending that can change without the intent to continue the story.  In fact, the change is so significant, there could be no continuation into book two.  The protagonist is killed.  Paul, the messiah in the story, dies, but his consciousness is woken up in all the other characters in the story universe.  The planet even develops a consciousness and begins traveling the Universe, or something to that effect.  I see a man, Jodorowsky, relatively unbound and exploring the messiah complex.  \n\nHe doesn't have the normal constraints of the studios to fit a story into a particular formula that is shown to be replete amongst the multitude of hero/savior/Jesus figure archetype films that features a return or a rebirth of a fallen, lost, missing, or literally dead character.  For Jodorowsky, the aspect of his psyche relating to a messiah dies.  His film dies.  Although it's beautifully detailed for the production companies, they don't trust him to manage the money, so it dies.  The film dies.  The asteroid analogy is beautiful because it articulates how so much growth in the film industry came after Jodorowsky's attempt.  It arguably influenced and literally aided in the growth of artists involved to allow them to step up to more completable projects that had their own profound influences on film making and the society that downloaded the films.  In a sense, the storyboard was what the film makers needed to move the engine of social awareness forward when Dune may have just been the equivalent to Jodorowsky's midnight cults, those of us that didn't need to sleep in order to process the next day functionally.  If the world wasn't ready for Jodorowsky's revelation, an evolution of the concept of the messiah, as so many cultures are still firmly rooted in a fabricated external and ethereal presupposition, then the pieces of the asteroid were necessary components for destroying and rebuilding aspects of the psyche to get us to that point, a point in time when something like Jodorowsky's thematic climax and revelation might be a more poignant and digestible concept for potential viewers.  This concept, however, was digestible and relevant to the film makers, those guiding the forces of psychological growth for consumers while simultaneously courting them for their cash.  They learned how their movies spread their own psyche into the thought structures of their viewers.  \n\nThe golden gem of this piece is Jodorowsky's comment about searching for a spiritual aspect within Dune.  I immediately thought, 'there is none.'  I'm 3/4ths through the 4th book, and I haven't found one.  Mentions of religion are that of their construction and fabrication on the part of controlling factions.  How they are used as tools to forge society how they see fit, they being, at a point in the story, the Bene Gesserit, and later, another character that I won't spoil for those that have likely not read the books.  To me, I see the novels, so far, to serve as a platform for an intellectual discourse about the things that are commonly abused in our current society as supplemental to a spiritual life.  I'm assuming Frank Herbert goes somewhere with at least a tacit facilitation of a spiritual development beyond his mental (albeit beautiful and grand) masturbation, but for Jodorowsky searching book one, he doesn't find it, and like a spiritual warrior, puts it in the film where he believes to be the perfect point which is STILL too soon for our visual culture.  For Frank, it was an exercise.  The messiah is obviously a construct that he uses as a device or that his characters use as a device in the story for the good of mankind.  The good of mankind, in Jodorowsky's view, was to evolve the messiah complex to include each individual on Earth to begin to understand their collective consciousness.  Frank instead delves into the individual having access to the collective consciousness.  I'm assuming that this develops into the later books, a manner of describing a cultural concept of spirituality that exists beyond tools of social coercion.\n\n[Book 4] I'm assuming the worm develops some sense of spirit in the zen life of swimming through sand, farting spice.  And perhaps, looking ahead to the later books, rather than being a mere progression of the various factions as they attempt to catch up to the total understanding owned by Leto, perhaps there is a development of spirituality in the books as those factions learn from the entity that became God-esque.  Frank being the origin and thinker for that character, himself being the explorer through writing, delivers to us the growth necessary for transcending all social constructs rather than simply the messiah complex which is deflated by its mere use as a tool by the appropriate characters.\n\nIf you guys that did plow through and read have a better idea as to where I can post this for more constructive feedback/discussion, I'd appreciate the advice.  Thanks.\n\nEdit:  The spoiler code didn't work, so i deleted it.  Paragraph(ing) was to include it in a spoiler cover, but oh well.\n","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/TrueFilm/comments/24ffd8/jodorowskys_dune_messiah_archetype_analysis_as/","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Jodorowsky's Dune: Messiah archetype analysis as well as the impact of his failed project.

I'll be writing some of these posts on behalf of my fianc\u00e9e, who encouraged me to post this story to Reddit. So here we go. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I were curled up on the couch at her dad's house next to each other, her feet wedged underneath my legs to keep them warm, her hands wedged in-between her thighs, while I had my right arm around her. We were talking to her dad about theology (I'm a seminary student), and just as he started to go on a tangent about a podcast he listened to the week before, his wife walked in. Now his wife, who is around 5'3\" and is upwards of 300lbs, is incredibly narcissistic, incredibly emotional, and all too quick to berate my fianc\u00e9e over every little thing. The only thing she cares about is complaining how dirty her house is, even though she is the one who hordes and makes it dirty. She treats her husband like crap and takes him for granted so much, but he refuses to divorce her because he didn't want any of his kids growing up in a divorced home; honestly, he's one of the kindest, most humble men I've ever met in my life. She treats my fianc\u00e9e terribly and constantly bashes her for wanting to get married so young (I'm 25, fianc\u00e9e is 23).  \n\nAnyway, she walks past the living room where we're all seated, takes one look at her husband, one look at us, and immediately begins to screech about how disrespectful we're being. We look at her, unsure of exactly what to say, before my fianc\u00e9e says, \"Look, we're not doing anything wrong. What are you talking about?\" She looks at us and says \"You're not a married couple! When I was your age I would have never been allowed to do that out of respect for my dad, and you shouldn't get to do it either!\" Her husband stands up and yells \"I am right here. I don't care if they're sitting next to each other. It's what normal couples do\" Amazingly, without blinking, she looks right at her husband, shakes her head and says \"Not you, asshole. I'm talking about my dad!\" \n\nNow the thing is, her dad has been dead for about twelve years. So the gist of what she was trying to say is that we were being disrespectful to a man who has been dead for over a decade; obviously it was just because she was jealous of my fianc\u00e9e over forty year old anger over not being able to live like a normal human being in her house. \n\nMeh. I can't believe I'm marrying into this insanity, but at least her dad, and her siblings, are completely decent folks- it's just the mom is absolutely nuts. \n\nMore to come.

When they tell you to walk, *walk.* it really, truly does make you feel better.\n\n2. Wear your stomach binder. It made me feel almost human, and allowed me to sleep on my sides. \n\n3. Seriously, take your meds. You can't be there for baby if you are in that much pain.\n\n4. This may seem odd, and may have been due to an exhausting discharge experience, but stay in the hospital the full 4 days. \n\n5. Have extra help arranged at home. My Mum came to stay, and I honestly do not know what I would have done without her. \n\nSo here I am 1 week after my perfect natural birth did a complete 180 on me and I ended up with a c section and LO in the NICU for three days. You really can do everything possible, all your research, and still end up where I did. In the end, there was nothing that could have been done to prevent this on the day, and very little that could have prevented it prior. Sometimes we all have to just roll with it.
