She had not seen him in weeks, and finally he had returned, the mages guild has always been strict in their training regime, he had joined to her dismay a year ago and had been away at some distant library learning the arts of magicka. She had missed him more than she thought was possible. He would have just had his 25th birthday and she could not wait to show him her affection. She came to a stop outside the mages guild, men and woman of many races exited and entered its silver trimmed doors. She waited impatiently bouncing up and down in excitement, a large grin plastered on her face. She was a stunning girl only just turned 19 years old, she had soft gray blue skin, silver white hair, and almost glowing red eyes. Her face was soft and attractive, her slender body was still blessed with curves and well endowed.\nWhen she saw his face her eyes widened and almost seemed to glow red with joy, \u201cTevyn!\u201d She ran to him jumping onto him she threw her arms around his neck and kissed him simultaneously. He wrapped his arms around her and held her returning her kiss. After what seemed like an eternity his gripped lightened and let her down to the ground, she looked up at him a big smile on her face giggling at him. He looked down at her smiling \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again Shelivah\u201d \u201cShelivah? That's all I get?\u201d She pretended to pout attempting to hide her smile. \u201cMy love...\u201d He chuckled \u201cIs that better?\u201d \u201cMuch\u201d she beamed up at him standing on her toes she kissed him again \u201cCome on, I made you dinner!\u201d He chuckled \u201cGreat... I hope someone taught you how to cook\u201d she giggled and pushed him lightly on the arm.\nThat night they spent without sleep, writhing in each others company. Early the next morning they lay on Tevyn's bed, their bodies entwined \u201cDo you still love me?\u201d He looked at her confused \u201chave I not proved that tonight?\u201d She giggled \u201cOf course but I just want to hear you say it.\u201d \u201cOf course I love you Shelivah... for now and always.\u201d she giggled again, nuzzling up against the dark blue skin of his chest she fell asleep a smile on her face.\nLight filtered through the window beating down on Shelivah's face, slowly she opened her eyes and looked around, she lay naked in Tevyn's bed alone in his small one room apartment. She stood still smiling and stretched in the light remembering the excitement they had shared the night before. Dressing in her lightweight cotton shirt and pants from the day before she stepped outside into the late morning sun. She had slept later than she had hoped but if she hurried she could get home, change, and still make it to drill that afternoon. Memories of the night before made her smile as she rushed back to her parents small house on the outskirts of town.\nShe had been training to become an Ordinator for five years now, she had always aspired to follow in her father\u2019s footsteps, to be a temple Ordinator in the service of the great house Indoril serving the temple and the living Goddess Almalexia. It had been hard and tiring work but she had excelled in almost every task she had been given, at the beginning of the year she had applied to join the Ordinator inquisitors and had been accepted to her own amazement, the most exclusive and powerful group within the Ordinators the Inquisitors were feared by everyone in morrowind. She smiled as she thought of her long future with the temple.\nPulling on her last glove she looked at her self in the shimmering pool of magica that purposed as her mirror. Her silver hair pulled back tight behind her head, her dark skin clean and smooth, golden leather armor accented in tan and blue was clean and crisp, everything in its place. Her sword snugly fastened to her belt, shield on her back held in place with a strap across her chest resting between her breasts. She smiled, she felt powerful when she saw herself in uniform, and it always helped that Mer would scramble to get out of her way when she walked through town. Her gold leather helm trimmed with gold sat on the table next to her, its tall frill down the middle stood tall and in perfect shape waxed and glistening. \u201cYou really do look stunning\u201d She grinned, her mother was quite serious and when she told Shlivah she was stunning she meant it. Her mother stood in the doorway, her own silver hair hanging down to her collarbones she wore a long blue lightweight dress that dropped almost to the floor. She was sixty years old and still had the appearance of a thirty year old mer. Shelivah had always thought she was beautiful and hoped she would one day come close to looking as beautiful as her mother. \u201cI try\u201d She turned to face her and while trying to hide her smile and keep her composure it was obvious she had failed \u201cYour blushing.\u201d Her mother said with a slight smile in her voice. Shelivah giggled \u201cI must be on my way, don't want to keep the temple waiting\u201d Her mother nodded \u201cIndeed... but I must ask where were you last night?\u201d Shelivah sighed \u201cMother I am 19 years old I can make my own decisions and life.\u201d Her mother nodded \u201cIndeed you may but until you marry or become a sworn member of the Ordinators you are still under the protection of your father and I... and as you were not here I must assume you spent the night with Tevyn.\u201d Shelivah nodded \u201cYes mother I did...\u201d she grinned again as she thought about the night before \u201cI welcomed him home properly\u201d Her mother just shook her head \u201cI was the same way when I was your age... but remember it cannot last, your father expects you to marry soon\u201d Shelivah nodded \u201cI will, as soon as Tevyn finishes his research project for the guild we are going to get married!\u201d Her mother sighed, a pained look in her eyes but said nothing, turning slowly she walked away.\nShelivah had been confused by her mother's actions, but carried on with her day. Her mother was a powerful healing mage who had worked with the temple for decades, she had taught Shelivah many things about healing. These skills had made her invaluable during an \u201cinvestigation\u201d, being the best healer on her unit had given her special permissions and responsibilities. But it had also made her a superb torturer. While she was perfectly able to use traditional healing spells, soothing and restorative she had taught herself to make her healing spells painful, excruciatingly painful.\nHer day was uneventful, it disappointed her slightly, no heretics, no ashlander attacks, nothing of interest, just walking around Mournhold watching people scurry out of the way of the Ordinators. She sighed as she trudged home, she loved her position, it had been the only thing she had ever wanted, but she wanted to see action! She remembered her father always had stories to tell when she was young, but she had yet to experience any herself, she had tortured a few heretics, executed some daedra worshipers but these all seemed mundane to her. Thoughts plagued her mind the whole walk home, thoughts of Tevyn, his position in the mages guild, her position as an Ordinator, her future, their future... The walk home seemed to go by in a haze, she did not even notice the same people she normally found time to talk to or visit with on the way home.\nShe pushed open the door to her parents small house, her mind still preoccupied, enough she did not notice the older Mer sitting in a chair by her father, they stopped conversing and watched as she entered. Absently she walked past them towards the back of the house where a stairway led up to a loft where her room was. \u201cShelivah..\u201d Her father called to her just as she started climbing the stairs, she turned turned around looking tired, noticing the older dunmer she stood up straighter slightly to look more official in her golden Ordinator uniform. \u201cCome have a seat we need to talk..\u201d motioned at a chair near them. Shelivah's frowned slightly but consented and walked over to the pair, her mother stood motionless near them and her face showed discouragement causing Shelivah to worry slightly. Sitting in the chair her father had motioned too she looked at them waiting for one to start explaining what had happened. \u201cThis is Bralis Redoran... he is a high standing member in house Redoran and is highly engaged in politics.\u201d Shelivah noded \u201cA pleasure Muthsera.\u201d Her voice was level, almost cold. \u201cHe forced a smile and nodded to her \u201cThe pleasure is mine.\u201d \u201cBralis has made quite the proposition... for your hand in marriage our family will be given a notable place within house Redoran, we will be given a large plot of land south of the ashlands, and will be compensated with considerable amount of gold.\u201d Her fathers voice was soft at first but became more confident as he continued. Shelivah's eyes opened wider and her mouth opened slowly, she was speechless, she had heard many female mer did have arranged marriages but thought her parents were different. Her brother picked his own bride, why should she be forced to marry? \u201cI know it\u2019s not what you thought you wanted, but it would bring significant honor and prosperity to our house.\u201d Her father continued after seeing her obvious shock. After what seemed like a long silence Bralis spoke up; \u201cI vow to be a honorable husband, and make your life as happy as possible.\u201d Shelivah shook her head slowly at first and then more sharper \u201cNo... I am going to marry Tevyn... we have already made plans!\u201d Bralis looked at her father raising an eyebrow \u201cTevyn?\u201d Her father shook his head \u201cPeasant boy with dreams of being a mage\u201d Bralis nodded in understanding. \u201cShelivah... I don't think you understand, the agreement has already been made, you are going to marry Bralis.\u201d Tears began welling up in her eyes and she looked angry, furious rather. She opened her mouth to talk but nothing came out. She stood, but felt weak in the knees, she stumbled over to the stairs \u201cShelivah! It will be better for your future and your children!\u201d Her mother hushed her father running after her \u201cShel please... listen to your father, it will be okay in the end.\u201d Shaking her mother off she stumbled up the stairs, collapsing face first in her bed she let out her emotions, burying her face in her pillow she sobbed.\n \nThe next few months felt dreary, she continued her duties as an Ordinator but was always depressed. She was forbidden by her parents to see Tevyn, however they still found times to see each other a few times a week. The would meet in the stables, or at Tevyn's house late at night, their rendezvous were quiet and short, they avoided physical contact during the day but still found each other making eye contact and passing notes. While they thought their relationship was secret it was far from so. Her father and Bralis had set the date of the wedding to be one year from the betrothal, enough time for them both to get their affairs in order. Bralis did not talk to Shelivah much during that time, the few times they had met it was short and awkward, rather quiet. Shelivah was obviously angry but would not betray herself by allowing those feelings to be seen. Shelivah had immersed herself even more into her duties, pulling extra shifts, putting herself on investigations she would not normally have. She found her only enjoyment in life when she was wearing her gold and blue uniform, her face hidden from scrutiny behind the cold mask.\nA month before the wedding Bralis had asked to meet with her over afternoon meal. She consented but was not excited to say the least. \u201cI have been talking to your father and he says you are spending most of your time at the temple, pulling extra duties as an Ordinator and pushing for advancement within the organization\u201d She nodded but said nothing. He sighed softly, \u201cI just wanted to make sure you knew that after the wedding you are going to have to resign from your duties, I cannot have my wife as part of the temple Ordinators. Your duties will change to support me during political matters and aid any guests that we may have, as we will have many of great importance.\u201d Her face turned cold and her eyes burned with anger \u201cA housewife?! Abandon my duties as an Ordinator!? Why?\u201d Bralis closed his eyes and sighed, he was an older Mer, about fifty years of age, his distinguished face was outlined by a close cut and well trimmed beard, his long dark hair pulled back in a braid with two smaller tails one over each temple hung down to the length of his chin. \u201cI thought I explained it, I don't to make you miserable but I wanted you to know. We will be moving to blacklight after the wedding.\u201d Her eyes burned, getting up from the table without saying a word she stormed off in furious anger.\n\u201cTevyn! Tevyn!!\u201d She hissed outside his window, it was dark outside, not quite midnight, the streets were empty from what she could tell, only a few peasant vagabonds and an Ordinator patrol were to be seen. She heard footsteps coming from within and the door creaked open causing some of the homeless to look their way. Quickly she slipped inside, wrapping her arms around him she kissed him tears in her eyes \u201cI don't want to marry him! I don't!\u201d she began crying tears running down her face. He held her, \u201cI know my dear... but it is your duty\u201d She shook her head strongly \u201cNo! No it is not!..\u201d she paused, stopping her crying she looked up at him. \u201cLets run away! The two of us! Let's get away from here, just forget our lives and move on! We can go to skyrim, or Cyrodiil and nobody will ever find us!\u201d He thought for a long moment. \u201cAs a mage I can make it anywhere...\u201d he looked down at her \u201cLet's... lets run away\u201d Her face turned from sadness to pure joy tears of happiness in her eyes now \u201cI love you! We will leave tomorrow night! Pack today and I will come here tomorrow after dark, we will slip out together!\u201d He nodded a smile creeping across his face. That night they made love like never before.\nEarly the next morning before the sun was up Shelivah left his house and rushed home, sneaking inside she packed a few things in a bag and donning her Ordinators uniform left the house. She had not seen her father sitting in the shadows when she arrived home, or when she left. His face emotionless. The day seemed to fly by, this was the happiest she had been in the last eleven months, she had just turned twenty and was of age to bear children. The wedding was set to be in a few weeks but it would not matter as she would not longer be around for it to happen. She hid her bag in some bushes on her way home, she ate dinner with the her family that night, and while it was not known to them she knew it was her last meal with them, she tried hard to hide her smile but found it extremely difficult. She went to bed early that night excusing herself and telling them she had to be up early for her duties. They said nothing.\n \nShe tried to sleep but it would not come, the excitement of the coming day made it difficult for her to function. Finally she fell asleep, sleeping for just a few hours. At the first hour of the day she awoke, washing her face she donned her Ordinator inquisitor uniform, an all black version of her normal gold uniform. She snuck out of the house without making a noise and made her way to the bush where she had stashed her pack. Retrieving it she made her way quickly to Tevyn's house, along the way running into an Ordinator patrol, she stood tall and in her black uniform showed the air of great importance, both Ordinators bowed their heads and in unison acknowledged her \u201cMa'am\u201d She smirked while she would never do that work again she would be with the Mer she loved. Maybe she could be a Mercenary, or an assassin. Her eyes lit up at the prospect. Tevyn's house was not far and when she arrived she knocked on the window three times in intermittent knocks. She heard the door click and creak open, swiftly she moved inside, \u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d she hissed at him in a hushed tone. \u201calmost, just need to grab one more thing.\u201d He had a few bags packed on the bed, she tried to lift one and it was quite heavy. \u201cWhat do you have in these? Books?\u201d He smirked \u201cyes I need all my material, it would be a waste if...\u201d \u201cNo we need to travel light!\u201d she hissed back, Tevyn sighed and nodded \u201cVery well let me bring a few of them at least.\u201d she sighed deeply \u201cFine, take what you can bring in one bag, one for you back one to carry.\u201d He grinned and started sorting through the books again. She looked out on of his stained windows impatiently, the early summer sun started filtering through the windows casting playful light on the floor. \u201cWe need to go Tevyn\u201d she hissed at him, but he did not respond. Turning she saw him; a look of horror on his face, holding a blade to his throat was a Mer dressed in all black, a mask pulled up over his face and a hood, only his yellow eyes were visible. Shelivah gasped and pulled at the dagger tied to the small of her back, at the exact same moment the assassin pulled the blade across Tevyn's neck, a red line appeared as Tevyn gasped, blood flowed quickly out of his throat and ran down his chest soaking his robes, he gasped for air but his vented windpipe made a wheezing honk, and then gurgling as he began drowning in his own blood. The assassin let go he fell to the floor blood spraying from the arteries in his neck. \u201cNo!!\u201d the scream came before she could stop it, she threw the dagger at the assassin but he was gone out the same window he had come in before she could move. Rushing to his side she started trying to apply healing magic but the wound was too severe. \u201cDon't die! Please don't die!\u201d she cried as she tried in vain to heal his neck. Her emotions made it hard to control her magica. He looked up at her, fear in his eyes, his mouth curled into words, \u201cI love you\u201d his lips had moved but no noise came out, and then the blood stopped, the air stopped, and he went limp in her arms. \u201cNO!\u201d She screamed at the top of her lungs \u201cDon't! I need you! Come back to me!\u201d She held him sobbing for what seemed like hours. She kept yelling at him over and over but he would not listen, was he really dead? Why couldn't she save him? Her noise had wakened people from the surrounding houses, one of the neighbors came in and seeing the pool of blood and seeing her sobbing holding her dead lover ran to her parents house. By this time half of Mournhold had heard what had happened, some of the citizens tried to pull her away from the corpse but she pushed them off and just kept sobbing kissing him and trying to pour healing magic on him. \u201cCome back to me!\u201d she screamed over and over but he would not listen. Her older brother had heard and came running, her father had someone alert Bralis who also came. Her brother walked, softly placing his hand on her shoulder \u201cHes gone Shel, come, lets go home.\u201d She shook her head holding him tighter \u201cShel please... let them take the body so he can be sent off with dignity.\u201d Finally after what seemed like an eternity she let go, her own black leather armor covered with blood. She had cried more then she thought she could, and had cried until she had no more tears to cry. She walked out to the crowd, the early morning sun shown down making the blood on her leather armor glisten, her eyes were blank and her face cold. Seeing her father and Bralis her breathing increased and her eyes burned up with a fury no one there had ever seen the like before. \u201cYou did this!\u201d she screamed pointing at her father \u201cIts your fault he is dead!\u201d He shook his head \u201cCalm down Shel, its over, I am sorry for your loss, but he would not want you like this\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d She screamed \u201cYou and You did this!\u201d she pointed at her father and Bralis. They looked at each other and then back at her, \u201cIts better this way my dear, you have no more strings here, you can move on to the glorious future that awaits you\u201d Bralis seemed genuinely happy, but hid his smile well. Shelivah's eyes burned with an unnatural glow \u201cNo...No.. I will live a future I want... and I will send you to Oblivion!!\u201d Her voice started as a whisper and grew to a scream. Pulling out a second dagger strapped to her thigh she leaped forward and in one motion pushed it through Bralis' neck, severing his windpipe, artery, and spinal cord in one motion. Bralis' eyes turned vacant and as she pulled out the dagger he collapsed to the ground dead. \u201cWhat have you done?!\u201d her father rushed at her but she spun and in that single motion slit his throat, blood sprayed across the crowd, grabbing at his throat he collapsed to the ground. \u201cWhat have I done? What have I done?!\u201d she screamed at him as he bled out choking on his own blood. \u201cNO!\u201d screamed her brother and ran at her. She ducked under his arms as he grabbed at her getting behind him she wrapped her arms around his head and in one strong motion spun his head 180 degrees with his body. The cracking sound of his vertebra popping could be heard throughout the square. Letting his body drop to the floor she looked around at the crowd standing in shock. She started controlling her self, looking down she realized that she stood over the corpses of her brother, father, and betrothed. Fear took control of her. She heard the guards running toward her, she had to escape she had to get away. But Tevyn! She looked back in the house and saw his lifeless face staring back at her.

{"title":"First LSD Trip Saved My Life","name":"t3_43lwxc","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"media_embed":{},"selftext":"Hey everyone,\n\nLittle background knowledge about myself, I'm 17 years old, I've done shrooms 5 times, and I smoke weed regularly.\n\nFirst off, my parents are very against weed, and do not know about my use of psychedelics. I was getting in trouble constantly for smoking weed, and getting drug tested all the time.\n\nThe story starts on a Friday night at my friends house, we're going to a party together. I was buying acid the next day to have my first trip with my friend. So I was really excited for this weekend. I should have known something was wrong the second I walked into this sketchy house in a bad neighborhood at 12am. The first thing I see when I walk into the party is someone putting a gat in away in the waist of their pants. Immediatly, I see my ex girlfriend with her boyfriend, and she's all over me, drunk as fuck. So she tells me to sip her drink and i just start chugging it. I have a lot more to drink that night, I don't think I've ever been this drunk. So as the parties dying, we all decide to go another party, and my friend says he's gonna take an uber to the party. (Now this is where I made my biggest mistake by not going in the uber with him). So I say \"Nah, someone already offered me a ride\" and he just says ok and we go our seperate ways. As I'm exiting the house with my ride and his friends he says he parked the car down the block so we have to walk to it. This is the last thing I remember until I'm on the street with a sore face, black eye, busted cheek, no phone, no wallet, and I lost my chain. I am so drunk at this point and I am completely delirious at this point. So I see a police car and just tell them I need help. So they bring me to the hospital, my dad shows up, heartbroken. I come home to my mom crying, drinking, complete emotional mess. I was with this girl at the time who no longer wanted to talk to me. Most of my close friends I used to have never wanted to hang out with me at this point in my life. I was just completely alone, my parents couldn't even look at me. My parents were also on the verge of a divorce because of all the trouble I had been getting myself into lately. So my dealer hits me up and wants to do the lsd deal. I just really didn't care anymore so I tell him to put the 2 tabs in my mailbox and I'll put the money in the mailbox. I don't know how we pulled the deal off with my parents in the house. But we did, and I planned on taking them that night, but fell asleep at 10pm on accident. But I woke up at 3am, this is a monday morning, and I'm not going into school today. I drop the 2 tabs, I'm peaking within an hour, having a great time just hanging out listening to mac miller on my laptop. But then its 6am, the time my dad wakes up, he walks in, hugs me and says bye and i say bye. After this, my trip turns sour. I'm getting this horrible vibes about my life and my parents. It's like 8am now and I go downstairs to see my mom still crying. THIS killed me. My first trip on 2 tabs of double dosed lsd (400ug) and I'm seeing my mom cry because of me. As I come down, I tell myself I need to get my life together. I make a resolution to exercise everyday and study everyday. And stop smoking weed for a while until things get better. Everyday since then, I've been dieting, exercising, and studying. 1 1/2 months later, I'm here. Never been so confident in my life, my friends and I have reunited, my parents and I are on the best terms we've ever been on. Right now I'm going through the highest point in my life, and just a month ago I was at the lowest point in my life.\n\nI'm entirely grateful, and if you've read this far thank you and hope you enjoyed","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh7l","locked":false,"link_flair_text":null,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"media":null,"from_kind":null,"retrieved_on":1459148253,"thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"from_id":null,"permalink":"/r/Drugs/comments/43lwxc/first_lsd_trip_saved_my_life/","num_comments":16,"saved":false,"from":null,"created_utc":1454287487,"score":39,"secure_media":null,"ups":39,"subreddit":"Drugs","secure_media_embed":{},"author":"Connorcpc","archived":false,"quarantine":false,"author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"stickied":false,"over_18":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/43lwxc/first_lsd_trip_saved_my_life/","domain":"self.Drugs","id":"43lwxc"}

I wouldn't know, the last time I visited a doctor was 8 years ago, when I had my heart broken so bad I literally begged my mom to take me to a doctor.\n\nDoc put me on meds. Mainly Klonopin and some antidepressants I can't remember. For about one year I would come back to him regularly and he would adjust my meds. We switched antidepressants two or three times due to side effects. The I just stop visiting him.\n\nIt wasn't long before I stopped with the antidepressants. I felt better. I couldn't stop taking Klonopin, though. And I can't stop, to this day. For years I've been auto-medicating trying to fight something that I can only describe as Anxiety.\n\nIt's been getting worse year after year. I was always *nerdy* and introspect, but I aways managed to have a good social life. I used to enjoy parties. I used to enjoy girls. Hitting on girls. Having sex with them. Now the simply thought of it give me the chills. I still like girls. I don't like parties anymore.\n\nI say to myself it's because I'm older now. It was a phase and it's now behind me. I'm 28, btw. The truth is going to parties will get my hopes very, very high. I *must* have fun. I *must* hit on some girls. And I'm put to disappointment, rejection. I can't handle it.\n\nI don't know if \"afraid\" is the right word, but I'll use it anyway. I'm afraid of being with a new girl. What if I can't keep up with her shit? What if I can't satisfy her in bed? What if I cum too soon? What if I can't even put it up? What if she tells everyone? It's just too much to handle. I try to try. I message a bunch of girls on Tinder and Happn. When it's time to keep the conversation going, I just stop messaging them one by one. I say to myself it's because I don't have the time. But I know I'm just a self-lying bitch. I spend most of my workdays pretending I'm working and most of my weekends lying on my couch doing literally nothing. I get anxious just by hearing my phone buzz.\n\nI can't get my life straight. I can't seem to be motivated by *anything anymore*. How can I bring a girl into this mess? How can someone enjoy being with me when I can't even manage to live my own life? Better not even try.\n\nMy life is empty. Meaningless. \"Oh man, stop being such a pussy, you have *everything* I always wanted! You have a good job where you make a good amount of money, enough to pay for your nice apartment in one of the most hyped up neighborhoods in the city, where you live alone! Oh the amount of pussy I would get! Oh, you also have a car, girls must get all wet when you pick them up/drop them off. Seriously, why are you complaining again?\"\n\nThat's what I hear from all my friends. All the time. And I don't blame them. Why am I complaining?\n\nI don't fucking know. But I do know that I reached a point where I literally spent the whole weekend lying on my couch clicking on dank memes on Reddit. It was a sunny, beautiful day in Rio and I live literally across the beach. And I didn't leave my apartment. I avoided all possible social encounters. \n\nI don't know what to do. I mean, I know. I should probably go see a doctor. But I don't even know where to start. Where do I find a good doctor? When I was young my mom would take me. Ever since I became an adult and started living by myself I just hope I don't get sick. But with my Anxiety there's no way anymore. I need a doctor. At least I think.\n\nI wrote it all down at once without going back so maybe there are parts that don't make sense. Also, as implied by where I live, English is not my first language, so sorry about that.\n\n(TL;DR: Anxiety getting worse year after year.

I'm no longer as overweight as I once was, when I was 230lbs, however, I'm still not at the point where I'd like to be.

I've recently relocated to Adelaide from the UK, and as such I don't have that many friends over here yet. The ones I do have aren't really keen on this kind of thing unfortunately.\n\nI was wondering if there were any like minded, newbie/beginner level aspiring gamers who might like to make a few new friends and meet up once a week for a couple of beers and try our hand at a campaign? Perhaps with some board, card or video game play here and there to break it up a bit? \n\nMy only experience of RPGs is from watching a handful of series' on Youtube and playing a couple of sessions as a kid, so I'd like to meet people who are also relatively new to it all, but have maybe been put off joining a group due to fears they weren't experienced enough. I figure if we're all as clueless as each other, it'll be more fun trying to work out just what the fuck we're actually doing.\n\nA little about me: I'm Mark, I'm 26, I'm English and I like movies, gaming, soccer, breakfast foods, coffee, craft beer and listening to/playing music.\n\nI don't have the ability to host myself, but there's a good chance I could have access to a nice sized room at work, which would in theory be available most days/times and also benefits from a well stocked bar. It's a 3 minute walk away from Victoria Square tram stop which would hopefully make it accessible for many, but I'd be more than open to suggestions for other locations if any interested parties ended up being outside of the city.\n\nI also don't currently own any rulebooks or dice or board games, as everything I once had is back in the UK, but if there's solid enough interest for this to happen I will happily pick some up once we've agreed upon a system to play. I'd perhaps like to stay away from DnD and maybe try something like a western, space or apocalyptic campaign, any ideas or suggestions would be very much welcomed.\n\nIf this is something you'd be interested in, leave a reply or drop me a message and if there's enough potential we'll try and sort something out soon, maybe starting with a small gathering at the Hungry Hippo Cafe just to get everyone acquainted and try and organise what the hell we're going to do/play.\n\n\n**TL;DR: I would like to play some games and I wonder if you would too?**","downs":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_43m6ar","title":"Would anyone like to play some tabletop RPG/board games with me once a week?","author_flair_css_class":"is","is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","from_kind":null,"retrieved_on":1459148375,"link_flair_text":null,"media":null,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1454291100,"from":null,"permalink":"/r/Adelaide/comments/43m6ar/would_anyone_like_to_play_some_tabletop_rpgboard/","num_comments":45,"saved":false,"from_id":null,"domain":"self.Adelaide","id":"43m6ar","author_flair_text":"Inner South","edited":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Adelaide/comments/43m6ar/would_anyone_like_to_play_some_tabletop_rpgboard/","stickied":false,"over_18":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Adelaide","archived":false,"author":"markt09","quarantine":false,"score":24,"ups":24,"secure_media":null}

{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjdm","selftext":"Hopefully this all makes sense, but I just have to get this all out.\n\n\nI'm 24 years old and live in NY. I got my undergrad while living at home with my family, this has always been a huge regret of mine, but it's in the past so whatever. I am currently working towards becoming a physical therapist, in order to become a PT it is necessary that I get my clinical doctorate. This will take 3 years and I can expect to start with a salary around 65-88k depending on which setting I decide to work in. I will be starting the graduate program in september and i will be dorming at a college in the midwest. I've worked really hard to be accepted into graduate school and it was supposed to be a dream come true. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat being said, I'm 24 years old and a lot of my friends are in great careers and making a lot of money right now. I hate the fact that I have 3 years until I finally start making a decent amount of money. I worked my ass off to get into graduate school and now that I'm in all I can think about is how I won't be working until I'm 27. I'm 24 I want to be out working in the world. Graduate school now represents a loss in my mind, because i can't stop focusing on the 3 years it will take before I have a degree. That being said I don't have many other options besides going to graduate school. I have a bachelors degree in biology, without graduate school I won't be able to make that much money. I am very fortunate and don't have any debt, nor due i have to worry about paying for graduate school. \n\nSome people think I'm crazy for not being excited about being able to dorm for 3 years, saying that work sucks. But I cant help but feel jealous that my friends are spending all this cash, getting all this respect over their new amazing careers while i'll be in school for years longer. I'm also torn between what I should be doing until school starts in september. Should I desperately trying to find a job I love, or should I be preparing to be the best PT student I could possibly be.","locked":false,"name":"t3_43majx","hide_score":false,"title":"(24/M)Need a dose of reality and some perspective.

{"downs":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"media_embed":{},"title":"A story of depression: stay strong for others","name":"t3_43mcd0","hide_score":false,"locked":false,"selftext":"I was around eight when it all began. I found myself growing more anxious as the beginning if fourth grade approached. A new school out in the country was where I would be going, with all the kid of my age to join me. That was about two hundred, pretty big to the comparable 20 student classes of early elementary. School was all I really had. I was smart, I was we'll liked by my teachers and peers (despite being a bully thanks to my family being a dick to me) but that all changed. My mother told me that I was just nervous for the beginning of the year, she told me that make teachers were usually nicer than females, and I had a male teacher. He was nice, but he was just filling in for my real teacher while she was on pregnancy leave.\n\nAnyway, I had only a few familiar faces in my class. I quickly made friends with a couple people at my desk, but they wouldn't last longer than that year. \n\nPeople made fun of the clothes I wore. Handmedowns from my brother and sister- baggy basketball shorts, \"brand name\" Shirts from where my sister shopped, and whatever second hand clothes my mom could find. It didn't help that I was the shortest in my class.\n\nThat year, I got very sick. It was just before spring break. I spent a week in the hospital, another week off from school, and ten days for spring break. While in the hospital, my teacher had my class make cards to send to me. It was very nice except that many of them apologized for being mean to me and making fun of me. \n\nI returned to school following break, anxious as ever, but most people welcomed me back. My friends did that is. Others asked me what was wrong, others poked fun, and others simply ignored me. I was so very nervous though.\n\nThat same spring, I had my very first panic attack. It was at recess. A kid was making fun of my glasses while we waited to go inside, and I started hyperventilating. I felt like I might have thrown up or died of heart attack. I told my teacher, she asked me very kindly if something happened at recess and I denied it. She sent me to the offic and I sat there for about half an hour before being sent to class. The kid who made fun of me was making crybaby faces at me because yes, I did in fact cry.\n\nI began cutting my self around that spring. It hurt in an oddly satisfying way. My whole arms were covered in these scratches, not even enough to be considered a cut. I let them heel and did it again.\n\nPeople saw them but they were too young, as was I, to full comprehend what I was doing. They just called it wired, told their friends, but it failed to approve the gossip level of gossip.\n\nAs I said, school was all I had. In fourth grade, all my old friends went away and most of my new ones did as well too. My grade was (in part to the almost month i missed) lower than I was used to but still passing. My father, who barely recognized I existed despite being home nearly 24/7 simply said he was disappointed. My mom said I did very good but I knew I didn't. My brother called me stupid and my sister said she hated me.\n\nFifth grade. I got back one friend who I knew in 1st through third. She happened to be my best friend but we just fell out in fourth. We began hanging out and we shared with each other out hatred of our families (even though I realize now that I would be lost without my mom). I would go to her house and hear her parents say good night, love you, and see you tomorrow. My parents never said that to me, but they did my brother. I guess it was this reason that I felt unloved by them. It wAsnt until I witnessed her have talks with her parents about her crushes and everything else that I realized my family was not at all normal.\n\nSixth grade. I was down to this last friend who I could trust, but even though she frequently told her friends my secrets, I had no one else to turn to. \n\nSeventh grade was rough. I was getting tired of my friend, if you could call her that. I couldn't trust her well, and she felt like just another extension of my family that did nothing positive for me.\n\nI began hanging out with this girl who lived with her grandma. Her mother was an addict an in jail, and she had no problem sharing this with everyone she came across. She smoked cigerrettes and thought drugs were cool and soon I did too. Though I never touched a drug, everyone in school seemed to think I had. Not only that, but everything I told her, she told every one else. My self harming behavior? Absolutely? My virginity? She set me up with a guy in the eighth grade. Even though I was only twelve at the time, (he- thirteen or fourteen) he had no problem feeling my up, fingering me, sucking my tits, and making out with me for hours until the sun began to rise cueing him to sneak out of my place. He told everyone about that.\n\nI was now a druggie, a cutter freak, a smoker, and a whore. In my English class, I say next to two guys who were friends. They would often mock me and ask me to see my scars, ask if I cut my legs as well, or if I would have sex with them. They caused me great anxiety, and it didn't help that they told everyone else how I would turn bright red or look like I would burst in tears or whatever else.\n\nHalfway through the school year, my mom suggested I homeschool. I jumped all over the idea and I used the excuse that I was nearly failing. They still had no clue of my problems.\n\nI began homeschooling online and quit talking to most of the people from school, except the girl I was friends with since elementary. \n\nThat same summer, I went to her home for a whole weekend while my parents were out of town. I brought a bottle of wine my neighbor made (which was potent, might I add) and I drank 3/4 of the bottle in just a short amount of time. I was puking everywhere and her family members were taking care of me as if I were actually related to them. I got the sense that, just by the way they asked how I was and took time to get to know me, that they actually cared about me.\n\nIn eight grade, my mother lost her job. I began cutting worse than ever and on my leg so they wouldn't be visible in summer. I was running out of excuses for long sleeves. My father didn't work either. He was a stay at home dad due to an injury at work, and though you would think that made us close, it only seemed to make him dislike me more in my eyes. He never wanted to do anything fun, it was always about chores and what he wanted to do (work on a car, rebuild part of the house, whatever). \n\nOur financial situation was declining even more. What little money my mom did make was now gone. Though my parents fought often, it seemed to increase now. I always had the sense they were together only because they had kids and for no reason else. They didn't seem to think they by staying together, constantly forcing their kids to listen to them fight, could possibly be worse than having them switch between homes. \n\nAnyway, my mental state began to decrease even further. I didn't see things getting better. I didn't have hope at all. Before, I was cutting only as needed, maybe a week here, a week there in the next month, and maybe not for three more months. But now, it was every god damn day and I began to fear for my life. I was disgusted. Who could want a girl with such dispicible scars? Who will want someone as ugly as my old classmates claimed me to be? Who would want.... Me?\n\nI had become a complete recluse. My low self esteem kept me inside, scared that I would run into someone I knew who would strike up conversation like we were BFFs, terrified it might be someone who had picked on me before.\n\nThis went on until after ninth grade. My mom had gotten a job making a little more money than her welfare checks. After my freshman year, which was spent with my nose shoved in thousand oage novels, I just didn't feel anything any more.\n\nThe cutting had become so bad that both thighs now had fresh and old scars and cuts. I couldn't see any of these \"butt-loving\" guys ever wanting me, with these hideous things. I was so insecure. \n\nI turned to god as my last hope and like when I decided to become a vegetarian, my parents were not okay with. When I pierced my ears and asked for other piercings, god was always the first person to be brought up as he was the one who didn't make body parts for that reason. \n\nI was in Walmart and I bought a bible. My mom asked what I got, I told her with an annoyed sigh, and she completely flipped. I still don't understand why, but I was left feeling more alone than ever. I was denied a god even. \n\nI decided that that was it. I have no one by my side. I have my self thirty days ad marked it in my calander.\n\nIt wAsnt thirty days, but the day before Father's Day I knew was the day. As a sign to show my fathe he did a terrible job as one (basically, I wanted to ruin the holiday, tell him that he doesn't deserve to celebrate it). I kissed my dog goodbye, held him, prayed for a sign of an sorts, played fetch with my dog, prayed again and received nothing. Just shortly after noon, I took we'll over forty thousand milligrams of Ibuproferon, handfuls at a time.\n\nI figured of 600 mg is enough to cause me stomach pains, would would it do with a but more? I fell asleep watching what was probably Lost on Netflix, alone in my room, and woke up hours later. I was delirious with pain. I tried screaming my mom. Whether it came out or not, I have no clue. It felt like my throat was on fire or burning from the acid that my stomach was pushing up. I fell on my knees, puking my guts out. \n\nThis isn't supposed to happen, I cried to myself. It was supposed to be painless. I was suppose to be dead. It was dark out.\n\nI tried standing, but I fell. I tried crawling, but I couldn't find the door. I fell back asleep but I don't know for how long for. I remember crawling down the hallway and I lay on the floor for some time, trying to yell, but I couldn't. It was too cold from the air so I returned to my room where it was very warm. I lay back down on my bed.\n\nI must've been loud because my dad eventually came in my room, saying my name. By this time, I was again on my knees, puking on my carpet. My stomac was killing me, literally I knew.\n\n\"Take me to the hospital,\" they told me I mumbled. \"I need doctor.\"\n\nI don't remember much else besides being in the cold on the way to the car, and eventually waking in the hospital, peeling and barfing everywhere. I fainted on the way in and I was greatful they were able to attend to me right away.\n\nI woke up again and they said I needed an IV. I looked at my mom, asking where we were. Hospital. I was sick. No I was fine. You were throwing up, no, keep that under your tongue, it's medicine.\n\nI wanted to tell her, but I couldn't face her when I did. Hey mom, I tried killing mysed last night. The doctors brushed it off as the stomach flu.\n\nEven that, I couldn't succeed at and I felt like more if a failure. i went home just hours later and lay asleep on the couch, my head slowly feeling better, though I continued to puke until mid afternoon. My dog lay by my side the whole time, comforting me in my time of need. I felt good as new physically by this time, and I began scrubbing my carpet what my mother didn't finish, and I put my blankets in the wash.\n\nI told my dad happy Father's Day and apologized for not getting him anything. \n\nThe next day, I took about twenty pills more and tried hard to die this time. I spent the next couple days in agony and eventually returned to the hospital where I was given fluids and more medicines. Oh, and I had a UTI. \n\nI gave up on the double suicide attempt. That weekend, we went to the lake to celebrate Father's Day.  I was still weak but the site of the sun setting behind the evergreens was the exact sign I needed, just a few days late. I told myself alright, things are going up from her. That was my rock bottom, I thought.\n\nNo longer did I cut myself. Well... No.\n\nMy father called me lazy for sitting on the chair, reading all the time. He said I was a recluse and that I couldn't even go to the store if it was life or death. I couldn't even speak to family to tell them what wa going on with me, he said, and he was right. It wAsnt as if he were begging me in a sincere tone, but instead standing several feet above my seated self, saying in a voice that was disgrace, pity, accusing, and disappointment all in one. Maybe a little anger. \n\nAs if I chose to be as painfully shy as I was. As if his criticism all my life didn't help. As if.\n\nI was beginning my sophomore year at school, and in October I began getting anxiety again for the upcoming holidays. I would have to visit grandparents and they would ask the dreaded questions.\n\nHow are you- as if they actually cared.\nWhy are you in school- as if I'm getting a lesser education\nYou aren't on drugs are you- as if I'd tell them.\n\nI once again started cutting and though I thought it was rock bottom moths earlier, I seemed to be diving even lower.\n\nI had no friends, my own family can't substitute as friends, I can't even go I the store if it were life or death... Why am I here?\n\nI didn't want to ruin the holidays for everyone, so I said I would wait until January before I make any rational moves.\n\nThat would be this January. I'm currently a sophomore. I'm 15, homeschooled, alone, and terrified of myself. Just before typing this all up, I had finished a sobbing attack, crying for hours, begging someone to save me. No one ever does. Who is there even to save me? \n\nI keep telling myself it will get better, but how do I know that? It's just an excuse until next week, next moth, next year. It's just something we all say, waiting for our hero to swoop in.\n\nMy suicide attempt was not a try at death, but a cry for help. A plead, even. I want to live, but how can I? Nothing has changed.\n\nI don't know what in writing about anymore, this is so long. Sorry about that, and thanks for those who read. Please, share your story. Tell us how you're pulling through.","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqqf","distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","author_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1459148454,"from_kind":null,"saved":false,"num_comments":2,"permalink":"/r/depression/comments/43mcd0/a_story_of_depression_stay_strong_for_others/","from_id":null,"from":null,"created_utc":1454293560,"quarantine":false,"archived":false,"author":"JessieJackie17","secure_media_embed":{},"subreddit":"depression","secure_media":null,"ups":1,"score":1,"domain":"self.depression","id":"43mcd0","stickied":false,"over_18":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/43mcd0/a_story_of_depression_stay_strong_for_others/","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null}

I'm an Idaho resident and single parent of 1 child (who is covered by CHIP) and I pessimistically procrastinated until the last day just to see how the plans compared to last year. I didn't enroll last year or the year before because it made no sense to me, barring an accident, surgery or sudden bad health diagnosis, to pay over $200 a month plus a 4k deductible when I only visit the doc once a year for a preventative screening. Does this ring true for anyone else, or is it just me?? It still doesn't make sense this year and I'd rather not add the premium to my monthly bills if I don't have to. I took the penalty before and I'm begrudgingly willing to take it one more time out of my refund next year. I'm 39 and healthy so it's a risk I'm willing to take one more time.\n\nThat said, here's the cheapest (cheap premium is what I want) Bronze plan for me after a $39 credit on our state exchange. What do you guys think: $185.43/month, Combined Medical and Drug Deductible (Individual): $4200 (In Network). Everything is either $40 copay /after/ deductible or 50% coinsurance after deductible, except preventative care which is at no charge of course. There is just no way I'd ever reach half that deductible, so buying insurance just seems pointless and a huge waste of money. (Again, barring unforseen problems, in which case I admit it would be beneficial, but the chances are slim as yet. I don't do any risky physical activities (just yoga and light hiking) and rarely drive anywhere except around my small town.) Most of the plans look this way. Am I crazy to not take it? Tough love ok but in a nice way plz...\n\nAlso, will my daughter's CHIP stop if I don't re-apply? Was I supposed to re-apply to keep her on CHIP? (I submitted my state's exchange application last year, which got her on CHIP but I did not purchase a plan for myself.)","locked":false,"name":"t3_43mcea","hide_score":false,"title":"ACA still doesn't make sense for me.

I stopped drinking at 23 I'm 30 now. Over the years after eliminating one thing after the next in an attempt to improve myself I'm now at a point where I don't eat gluten( digestive problems), no processed sugar (not crazy strict, I'll have ketchup on a burger or something), no pornography, no hooking up using craigslist or hookup sites, and lately I'm working on adding limited casual Internet use...only as a tool when I need and and limited to like 2 hrs a week for entertainment purposes. The reason I have been eliminating these things is that I assumed they were addictive, now I'm realizing which as an ex AA man I should've thought from the gate is that's it's not those things as much as it is me and my brain. Basically if I have those in my life I let them take over and just over eat or cruise the Internet for hookups all days ....hours until I'm a zombie.\n\nAs I type this I'm feeling nuttier and nuttier, this is crazy man stuff right . I dunno....I feel good when I maintain that lifestyle, and can get on it for months at a time, probably 6 months straight of this kind of lifestyle has been my record over the years....at some point when I'm doing better and feeling better and the memories of depression are a distant almost zero memory, and I'm feeling like a splurge I'll go for it. And sometimes it's just a week and I'm back ...but lately I've been just back and fourth for months and my depression has gotten bigger and bigger. And I guess I've been sort of numb to it but recently I've gotten back on my clean lifestyle and I'm feeling depression so hard...and yeah that makes total sense.....all the dopamine things are now stripped away and I've got to feel all of it.

I'm not trying to wine I'm just saying art as a job might not be for me.

Once school started, I started eating 1500 calories a day, and still lost weight, stopping at 135. Football season ended, and I started doing wrestling in November. Given that wrestling practice is extremely exhausting and I was burning more calories than ever, I figured I could eat 2200 calories. Why 2200?

Now, he himself is Caucasian, but his father moved him and his 2 siblings to Mexico when they were rather young (I believe my Dad was 5) and married a native who he was still wed to when he passed 2 years ago. So, about 1/3 of that side is Mexican and at least half speak Spanish. \n\nBecause of this I am very eager to learn, especially because of my Grandmother. Grandpa was kinda the translator for us when we were together as she doesn't speak much English so our communications are limited. As previously stated, he passed and I'd like to get closer to my Grandma before she follows. She is a very sweet woman. I also admit, I'd like some recipes as well....she's an amazing cook lol. \n\nSo, I am a huge Duolingo user and it's done more for me than any previous attempts at learning another language. I also have the first season of Rebelde and I try to watch some daily. I understand about 10-20% of it right now and can catch the basis of most conversations, but it has no Spanish subtitle options so following along is hard! I could read better than listen but I guess this will force that.\n\nI mainly just wanted to say Hi, but I'll ask, are there any shows or books you recommend? I just saved the music suggestion post but if anyone knows of any Mexican metal bands I would appreciate a suggestion lol and I love the idea of trying kids books, but I'll take any really!\n\nNice to be here :)","locked":false}

I've read books on it, tried all the tricks I could find, and nothing ever really helps.  So I'm not looking for ways to \"cure\" myself, I've more or less given up on that.  I'm 30 and I've been this way as long as I can remember.  I've even been to a urologist and didn't get far with it.\n\nI have an 8+ hour road trip coming up with some friends that I'm really anxious about.  I know, for that 8 hours, there's a 95% chance I won't be able to use a restroom.  It won't be until we've settled into our destination that I'll be able to go.  This happens all the time, I have to stress and prepare over public events because I know if I drink too much water and have to pee, the rest of my day is ruined until I can get home.  There was one time I came really close to passing out due to not drinking enough water.  So instead of just neglecting myself water, I'm trying to balance on the line where I can drink enough to hydrate myself, but not need to pee super bad.\n\nSo I'm wondering if there is a rule of thumb for if I'm going to be in a car for let's say 9 hours, what is the bare minimum amount of water I can drink to stay relatively hydrated but not have to pee?  I know it isn't ideal, but I would much prefer being a bit dehydrated than the agony of having to pee for hours.\n\nAnd the real kicker is I'm going snowboarding for a couple days during this trip.  So I know hydration is REAL important for preventing elevation sickness.  So I'll drink more water on this day, but in the past staying active (snowboarding) tends to make it so I don't need to pee as much (sweat?).\n\nThanks for any information.  This problem stresses me out to no end, but I have to deal with it.  Anything to set my mind at ease would be great.\n\n\n","locked":false,"link_flair_text":null,"media":null,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1459148528,"from_kind":null,"author_flair_css_class":"default","is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self"}

My stools were diarrhea for a few months, but have since turned to normal, but I do still get a lingering bloated feeling after some meals. \n\nLong version :\n\nAbout June of last year I had a single episode where I had intense diarrhea and a good amount of bright red blood in in a 24 hour period. I got it checked out. I've had numerous stool samples tested for occult blood, all tested negative. (last one was probably 5-7 months after initial incident). I had a small bowel done with a barium swallow, came back fine. I've had lots of blood tested for numerous things, and everything was fine besides 1 marker for chrons and 1 genetic marker for celiac. I had an upper abdominal ultrasound done, everything was clear save some gallbladder sludge. I check my wieght numerous times a weak, and I've stayed constantly within a 10 pound range. I've visually checked stools and the most I've seen was dark brown, and I haven't had blood (I did see a little after the barium swallow, but it could have just been irritated hemorrhoids.) \n\nI've tried going gluten free, and it had no significant impact on my symptoms, but I did notice if I take a multivitamin the symptoms seem to stay away. I'm 22, with no family history of colon cancer but I'm still worried, and I haven't confessed this in person, but almost everyday I loom over my demise. The next steps are either a colonoscopy or a CT scan, but I don't want to take the risk of unnecessary radiation exposure. I know this isn't a sub for colon cancer, but it sheds some light on my concerns, and I'm not sure if my current symptoms are common for ibs. I've been to two gastroenterologists and they don't seem concerned, and statistically, I shouldn't be either, but that doesn't really help.
