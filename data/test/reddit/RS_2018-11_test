The picture tones it down bit, but you get the general idea.\n\nBackstory: I'm 24 and just got diagnosed with PCOS. I was on birth control for 8 years and my skin was great, went off of it last year to try to get pregnant, and my skin has been crappy ever since. I'm still trying to get pregnant, so there's a lot of things I can't use. I went to a dermatologist and they gave me doxycycline and 5% benzoyl peroxide face wash (neither of which help) and retin-a (which I can't use since I'm trying to get pregnant). Also can't use spironolactone since Im trying to get pregnant.\n\nMy skin issues: Really dry skin, hormonal acne on my jawline and cheeks, tiny bumps everywhere except my forehead.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nAM:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wash - benzoyl peroxide wash with warm water and wash cloth\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moisturize - Murad Essential-C daytime moisturizer with 30SPF\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Primer - Bare minerals combo control\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Foundation - Bare minerals bare pro foundation\n\nPM - \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remover- Garnier micellar water and cotton pads\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wash - benzoyl peroxide wash with warm water and wash cloth\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moisturize - Murad Essential-C night time moisturizer\n\nProducts I've tried recently: Drunk elephant protini moisturizer, drunk elephant glycol acid serum, retin-a, murad essential-c toner\n\nMy skin has a direct affect on my self-esteem and my depression. I no longer can leave my house without foundation, even when we go camping I make sure to put on foundation before leaving the tent. (When Im at home I'll go makeup less to give my skin break). Even when I don't have big red bumps my whole face except y forehead is covered in tiny bumps that make my makeup go on unevenly and look bad. You can sort of see the bumps in the second picture where I circled them.\n\nPlease help! I just want smooth skin\n\nEdit: I\u2019m new here and tried to follow all the rules, please let me know if I messed up!!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SkincareAddiction","subreddit_id":"t5_2tbbg","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/SkincareAddiction","subreddit_subscribers":857250,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"PCOS [acne]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SkincareAddiction\/comments\/9t4fau\/pcos_acne\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

But I need to get this unpopular opinion\/rant off my chest. SO FUCKING MANY girls my age or younger have just had babies \/ are pregnant. (I'm 24 btw) And that's obviously fine - you do you. But it feels as if these very, very young girls have adopted the image of being a mother. They need to PROVE to you that they're a mother. Shoving picture after fucking picture, \"LOOK AT MY BABY GIRL SO SWEET\"  \n\n\n\"BABY'S FIRST MEETING WITH GRANDMA\"  \n\n\n\"BABY'S FIRST TOOTH\"  \n\n\n\"BABY'S FIRST HUGE SHIT\"  \n\n\nI don't know. I know our generation is growing alongside social media. But fuck me, put the fucking camera down for a moment. Stop using your child as an accessory or as 'proof' of how in love and devoted you are. And on that note, does anyone else feel a little wrong at the idea of sticking thousands of pictures of your baby up for the world to see, without them knowing?   \n\n\nMotherhood seems so...invasive these days. I get putting up a nice picture occasionally of a really special day out or something. But it now feels like mothers are showboating their kids. Oh, on that note - parents who post pictures on christmas eve of how many presents they've bought their kids, all wrapped up. I HATE that. It is so smug. It's, \"Look how much of a good parent I am!\"   \n\n\nAs you can likely tell by now, I'm not a parent, so maybe my views are biased because of that. But I'd imagine from another parent's perspective, who perhaps can't afford many gifts, they must feel so inadequate. Idk.   \n\n\nAnyway, point stands. So many women\/girls use their baby as a social media trophy. It's bizarre, invasive and not needed. Spend those precious moments and keep them to yourself, it's more intimate that way.

I had a decent amount of money saved up before I moved here, so I figured I would be fine, but I had to pay for a few different car repairs totaling around $3000 on my drive up here, and that left me with practically nothing. I'm currently only making about $700 a month, and my student loan (around $1100) instantly went to paying rent, and paying off loans. I don't know what i'm going to do, I can't afford the things i'm going to need for the winter. I've been applying for another job, but a lot of the places are either looking for full-time employees or their part time conflicts with school. Also I feel that if I overload myself with too much work, I'll end up getting extremely depressed and self-destructive again. But if I don't, I might end up homeless, I have no where else to go. I'm really doing everything I can think of, but I feel like i'm running out of time.\n\nAny advice or help would be appreciated, i'm lost and stressed beyond comprehension.

I'm 19, a college sophomore, always been introvert\/quiet guy in general, I have a few friends but dont really have a \"friend circle\"(people to always hang out with I guess) and never had a girlfriend, so outside of class I'm usually alone. Before I wouldn't really mind being alone and just do things myself (play games, watch netflix,etc) but lately I've been wanting a little more outta my college experience. Going to parties occasionally(or go enough times to see if I enjoy the environment or not), building relationships with people, getting experience with girls (I have none at the moment)\n\n  \nAnd I have no clue (to an extent) on how to fix this. I know I have to push myself out of my comfort zone but that's easier said then done. For example there's a girl in one of my classes who I find cute and would like to get to know but the thought of approaching her after class seems impossible for me(I overthink a lot of thinks) so I've never done and probably wont (there's only about a month and a half left in the semester)\n\n  \nAnd when I hang out with the few friends I do have I hear stories of their weekends with their friend groups, but I would never ask to if I could tag along cause in my mind it would be weird to hang out with their friends who I don't really know.  \nPlus if I ever find myself in a group setting, I would usually just sit there on my phone not really adding to the convo(sometimes I actually have nothing to say however).   \nAlso alot of people smoke\/drink and I do neither (im not opposed to it per say, but I dont really have people I trust to do it with i guess)\n\n  \nIt just gets frustrating sometimes thinking about it. It would be cool to hang out with a group of friends here or there. Chill with a girl. Possibly meet new people. It just feels like I'm missing out....I know I'm missing out but I'm not trying to overhaul my personality to be something I'm not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TooAfraidToAsk","subreddit_id":"t5_2ssp7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TooAfraidToAsk","subreddit_subscribers":434190,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I think I need help\/advice on how to be better socially?

On one hand, I feel like I've got years of fitness. I've been running on and off for quite a few years and have a 5+ year cycling background. This past 12 months has seen my first half marathon last thanksgiving (1:55), the Blue Ridge Marathon (~3000ft of gain, cool weather, 4:55), Ironman Chattanooga (12:17 no swim), another local easy half (1:58 with ~1200 gain) and the Marine Corps Marathon [pushing a wheelchair athlete](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=87HHUebGtks) (4:51.)

I'm capable of googling for training plans and such, but I'm just curious to hear thoughts and a reality check. What should I know going from road running to trail ultras?

It was a collection of computer games actually, placed on one or two discs. I don't remember how many games it was in total. It could have been \"101 Computer Games!\" or it might have even been 501, or 1001. I don't remember. I think it really was 1001. But it was a lot for the price at the time.\n\nSome of the games were \"well-known\" like one caveman game from the 80's. or 90's I believe. Where you'd do flintknapping and hunt deer. I can't remember the name, but I know for certain it's an actual game with a Wikipedia page. I just looked now, it's called \"Sapiens\" for the Atari.\n\nSome of the games were weirdly sexual. Like, I don't know how they got past whoever was supposed to make sure they were acceptable for a dollar store game disc. One was just \"The Penis Game\" and it was like a slot machine where you tried to make a dick or something. Another one was called \"Meat Market\" or something similar. Or maybe the name was more gruesome. It was some kind of gritty RPG though (that either didn't work or was too complicated for me) and actually wasn't sexual in nature. Though I clicked that one to play it because I thought it was.\n\nAnother game was marshmallow robots, or something. You'd get to choose their stats (totally arbitrarily) and these little robots would try to push each other off the fighting platform. You could make them each super strong, super fast, give them super accuracy, or you could make them both very weak, or make the fight lopsided. \n\nLots of these games didn't even seem to work. And if I recall right, you could only go back to the selection menu by closing the whole program and going again. I must have spent hours and hours and hours playing these games.

I went to college for about 6 years and never graduated due to being aimless and not seeing any use of a Psychology degree. Depression and financial pressures ( I lived off student loans due to bad advice given to me by a parent) caused me to suffer mentally and I couldn't continue in school a few years ago due to being kicked out for academic probation, twice. Have suffered depression since about 17 honestly. I live in Canada, but didn't grow up here and it seems like everyone I meet is getting help from family for bills\/housing (not an option for me), or just living off of connections from people they know getting them good jobs. I've worked in different positions but mostly short term and without direction. I am now in this awful loop where I need money to live, but none of my work experience\/skills are valued by employers. (Photography, typing fast, and interest in film etc.)\n\nI have family in the US that I can go live with but not for more than 6 months. Of course, I can go down there and just stay (illegally) but what kind of life is that? No real jobs would hire me and it's just so precarious taking that route. \n\nMy overall feeling is that if I don't find a connection or someone does a favor for me in terms of helping me get a good job etc, I will be sucked down into awful jobs working with shitty ppl for shitty wages. Not where I thought I'd be a year before turning 30 back when I was 18 starting school. My distrust and disgust for other people is at an all time high, I really prefer to be on my own to read interesting things and discover myself. Getting outside helps, but I always get irked when I see other people enjoying the beautiful outdoors we have in Canada and disturbing my peace. Sometimes, I feel happiness but it's always fleeting and never lasts. People have treated me poorly in my life and I don't know if it's due to apathy or what, but when I stand up for myself I lose my temper extremely quickly. Road rage, etc.\n\nThis is a great community and I'm really just looking to hear from other people in similar boats or going through similar struggles in their past or current lives.

I went in for a wellness checkup 2 weeks ago, and asked the doc to do a tick panel. He said \"Why on Earth would I test you for that? Insurance doesn't pay for patient requests.\" I explained that all my other tests were negative, and I'd pay for it, because I've been sick my whole adult life and I'm tired of it. He begrudgingly agreed to do it, after handing me contact information for local psychiatrists. Well lo and behold the test was positive for lyme. I started a 21-day round of doxy, 200 mg twice a day. I'm on day 7. I know that supposedly antibiotics work very well on lyme, but I'm worried because I've had it for so long (I haven't had a tick bite that I'm aware of in over ten years).

Did a bit of the driving school, but shortly went ahead and just bought the cars I wanted. I got the developer mode bug in January, giving me every car in every color, max credits and mileage points as well. Back in August, I loaded the game up on my other PS4, and it had no progress on it. Once I got back on my main PS4, I had lost everything on that one as well. \n\nSince then, pretty much every week, I end up deleting my saves and restarting. I just don't know how I want to play the game. I go one way and then the next week I don't feel like it and restart. I also feel like I care way too much about my stats, even though nobody looks at them. I'll be enjoying the game for the week, but then I suddenly get the feeling like \"Maybe I should do this,\" \"maybe that would be a better way...\" and I  end up restarting and thinking to myself \"what the hell are you doing.\" Just got out of that episode a few hours ago. I feel like I need reassurance in how I play. \n\nThe real issue for me is deciding on what cars to use, gift or bought or both. I initially used gift cars only after beating all of the campaign a second time, because I had 2 cars I knew I'd use a lot. Then I realized how dumb that was, perpetually limiting myself to using those 2 cars and 217 Suzuki Swifts. \n\nThen I thought maybe going through GT league and buying the cars as I go. I'm really just looking for a way to feel like I'm making progress, or at least working for my cars, kinda like the old games. The fact I have the deluxe edition (with no way to remove the bonuses) doesn't help. To me, getting lucky on a daily and getting a Cobra feels cheaty. How did I get it? Just got extremely lucky. No work put into it. My logic was to go through GT league and buy as I go, to give that sense of progression. I got impatient really quick. So I restarted. No real need for it, just did. \n\nThe last method is to NEVER use the gift cars. Buy a few cars with my starting money, then go ahead and use those. When I get a gift car, no matter what it is, 20 million credit Jag or not, I would sell it. Feels cheaty. You usually get the poor mans cars anyway (ie, the 217 Suzuki Swifts). \n\nI just can't make up my mind and I know it's so stupid and dumb. I'm 17 if that helps any. \n\nAny thoughts on this ridiculous post?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"granturismo","subreddit_id":"t5_2s4f7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/granturismo","subreddit_subscribers":23692,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I can't decide on how I want to play and it's making me crazy.

(I'm going to a doctors appointment for hormonal birth control this Monday; don't worry) Ive heard that sometimes pregnant women might still bleed, but lighter than usual and that terrifies me. Like im menstruating right now; but it feels so weird since it's without the terrible pain that I've been used to most my life. Is this normal? Like should I be buying a pregnancy test or going to the gyno?  I don't think stress is causing this either, I've been stressed much more than I am right now and still followed by terrible periods. I've also joined my college's martial arts club, but I'm not sure if this change in physical activity is the culprit since I used to play both tennis and ultimate frisbee and still feel fucking terrible. I'm also still pretty chubby, its not like I have the body of an athlete from a month of beginner jiujitsu lessons.

I have what I feel to be valid reasons to be depressed, and I don't know how to move forward. \n\nMy main issues are: No real support group, no job experience, no income.\n\nHere's my backstory (warning: kinda long)\n\nWhen I was 11 years old I started having chronic fatigue, I could no longer go to school, do swim team, hang out with friends, or even read. I tried going to various doctors and not one could figure out what was \"wrong\" with me.\n\nI eventually started doing better enough that I was able to go back to school for highschool. Things were seeming better, I made friends, I was getting good grades and I was hopeful. About halfway through the year I started doing worse, I started not being able to make it every day to school, I ended up barely making it through my freshman year. I didn't however make it through my sophomore year, as it turns out I missed too many days and was expelled. I fell deeper into depression after that. For the next few years I was again incapable of doing anything.\n\nIn what would be my senior year, I was doing better again and decided I would try to graduate. I spent a couple months learning what I needed to do to pass a high school equivalency exam. I technically \"graduated\" early so that was nice I guess. After that I decided I should try to go to college, so I enrolled at a local community college. I was doing allright at my classes but I wasn't making any friends. After 2 semesters I once again succumbed to depression and loneliness and no longer had the fortitude to keep up with classes.\n\nAfter awhile I started volunteering with a local theatre company, which was fun but they have since closed down. I did make a couple friends there but they are always busy\/moved towns. Around the same time I also finally got my drivers license. (woo) \n\nSo now here I am with essentially no friends, no job experience, no income. I am still living with my parents who are great and all but have no way of helping me with anything.\n\nI have been putting out job applications, to grocery stores mainly, but it seems like no one wants to hire someone with my credentials (ie: none) An issue I have been having with that is it keeps fueling my depression, I just end up feeling more and more worthless when I send out applications and hear no response, or if I do hear a response and get an interview I don't hear back from them even though it seems like the interview went well.\n\nLooking around at other people, it seems like for first jobs they either get a job because they know someone who can get them a job, or they get a \"shitty\" job. My issue with that is that I don't know anyone who can help me get a job, and that I have to be careful with my mental health so I can't take a shitty job that will make me feel even worse.\n\nSomething that makes all this almost worse is that all throughout my life everyone who has talked to me has always told me how intelligent I am, how nice and kind I am, and how I'm going to do great things. But if those things that essentially everyone says about me are true than why am I having such a difficult time just living?\n\nSometimes my complaints kinda feel self-defeating, but other times I really can't see what else I can be doing.\n\nTL;DR : I've had a shitty life, wasn't able to make friends or get a job, and don't have any resources to help me.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions, and also if anyone has any advice that would be greatly appreciated.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"depression","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqqf","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/depression","subreddit_subscribers":433643,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Looking for some advice","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/depression\/comments\/9t57y3\/looking_for_some_advice\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

My husband and I have been together for five years. We were married a year ago, I was a woman. Two months after we married I came out as a gay trans man. He wasn't surprised considering my disdain for femininity and my hatred for my body's function of being a literal incubator. I'd made small remarks my entire life about how men's fashion is better, how I wish I was born a man, and how I wanted to know what it's like to be a man. But I never directly hated my gender as a woman, just the gender roles that were forced on me as a woman. I did reject femininity in all its forms, and even hated it in the female friends I had. I've always preferred to hang out with the guys but was never treated as one of them. I felt like there wasn't much to bond over with women because I wasn't interested in anything they were into. I never felt like I was born in the wrong body like the common trans narrative says (though that's a valid narrative). I just hated being a woman, hated everything about womanhood, and looked at the male experience with envy.\n\nNow I've transitioned in every way possible without hormones or surgery. My husband has taken it all in stride and though my short hair takes him some getting used to and he has trouble touching me on the days I look superrr masculine, he's been nothing but supportive allowing me to figure things out for myself. It's been tough talking with him about things because he recognizes he has a personal stake in our marriage and feels biased when I ask him if something looks too masculine on me. I know that sounds wrong. It was wrong of me to approach this with the mindset of \"I'll only take this as far as he's comfortable with because he's important to me.\" But at the time I really didn't want hormones or surgery so I felt it was a compromise.\n\nThis entire process feels like it's been a push\/pull. When I cut off my long hair that had always been my pride and joy, it was emotionally taxing but I felt like I had to do it. I love the way short hair brings out the angles in my face. I miss the flowy lines of skirts and dresses, but I feel more powerful in men's clothing. Moreover, I miss the way my husband would smirk about \"easy access\" when I'd wear skirts\/dresses. But I also hate the concept that he liked me in them because it meant he could sexually touch me easier (if I wanted him to, consent has never been an issue). Like even in a healthy relationship, I was still meat to be consumed if I only said yes.\n\nI feel like there's a lot of internalized misogyny directing my transition. Like femininity is a hallmark of weakness. Skirts allow easy access for groping. Femininity means getting catcalled when I walk my dog. Femininity means I could be raped just walking to my car after work. Femininity is nail polish, makeup, glitter, pink, and lace...ew. Am I just transitioning because for all the advocating I do for women's rights, I hate womanhood? Is that a dishonest reason to transition? Am I being selfish? Should I seek help? I feel like I need help. I'm an emotional wreck and I feel like I'm going insane.\n\nI cried to my husband today. He is the most important person in my entire life. He is my other half. My partner in life. He says he recognizes that his role as my husband is to support me and insists he will never try to hold me back from something that makes me happy, but he also doesn't want to lose me and he's scared because he's not attracted to masculinity. We're both scared.\n\nWe just returned from a trip to see some beloved friends who moved out of state. While there I was gendered correctly the entire time and it felt so gratifying. I also had a moment of weakness at a Halloween party talking with a friend about all the things I dislike about my body. I want a leaner body, a more pronounced jaw and adam's apple, wider shoulders, deeper voice...all the things that would pull me further from my husband. But if I took hormones, I would encounter things I wouldn't want, like bottom growth and facial hair. Despite how mostly-happy the changes would make me, all these things would also make me and my husband vulnerable to discrimination and harassment. But there's no going back if I take hormones or have surgery. Even if I stop T, I see trans men who detransitioned still looking like men. Would I still look like a man even if I start taking T when I'm 30 and then stop? Is hormones something I even want now?\n\nI know no one here can answer all the tough questions for me. There's no manual on how to transition correctly. There's no magic words that will convince my husband to stick it out while the woman he loves turns into a man he cannot be happy with romantically. I don't know what I want, but I feel like a fraud, selfish, confused, and lonely. I feel scared that if I don't take the extra step to hormones that I'll just be unhappy with myself forever. I feel scared that if I do take hormones, I'm going to lose my husband and our entire future together will be just a dashed hope. We just got a dog together and have been making plans for a big move to a new city. I would be crushed if, a year from now, he's not by my side. If you're read this far, thanks.

Im a student full time so no job to take me away from training a devoted slave, and spending as much time talking to you as i can \ud83d\ude01 I have also finished university for the summer so I'm all yours. Also somewhat of a night owl so timezone differences are not an issue to me.\n\nSo my kinks are as follows:\n\n- Humilation\n\n- Degredation\n\n- Pain (causing)\n\n- Body writing\n\n- Control (i.e. full power exchange being the end goal). \n\nThese are just my main ones and not an extensive list. If you don't see one you enjoy please tell me, as chances are im into it.\n\nI don't have any dislikes so what ever yours are I'd say are mine. I'm very respectful in this manner. I also like to work on a dislikes, soft limits, hard limits scales. This meaning, I'll never make you do hard limits, soft limits things you will do but that require a little more caution when doing, these are things your rather scared of but will try if the conditions are correct. Hard limits are things you'll never do under any circumstances. And dislikes are things you'll do but actively dislike or don't enjoy, these things are usually used for punishments.\n\nSo as for what my should ideally. No younger than 18 obviously. No older than 30 (I'm open to older but it doesn't usually work, but hey we don't know until we try). Ideally someone my age but not a deal breaker. All body types welcome. All countries are welcome as well as timezones. However special consideration may be made to slaves from the UK.\n\nThe type of slave im actively seeking should be dedicated to me and her training. She should be comfortable in the sending of pictures and videos, as im a very visual person. She should also he comfortable perfoming via Skype, and talking on the phone. The last two are end goals and not something I'd expect immediately. Also not a deal breaker but my dream slave would be comfortable sending and showing face pics. In short my dream slave is a type of exhibitionist (if this isn't you, don't feel like you can't contact me).\n\nI ask that all perspective slaves have, at the bare minimum, a kik account. If you do have one awesome, read on for the next steps. If you don't, please make one its not hard and won't take long. I also enjoy using whatsapp and am more than willing to use it but please use kik to initially contact me.\n\nSo if you've read all this and are liking what you've read then please either pm with the following:\n\n- Name\n\n- Age\n\n- Experiance (if any, none is fine as i love training new slaves)\n\n- Toys (if any)\n\n- Favorite movie (so i know you've read the whole ad.)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BDSMpersonals","subreddit_id":"t5_2smyd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BDSMpersonals","subreddit_subscribers":52490,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"21 (M4f) UK Based Male Master Seeking Female Slave in anyplace (online with the potential to become more)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BDSMpersonals\/comments\/9t5e6g\/21_m4f_uk_based_male_master_seeking_female_slave\/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}

He was getting very distant, flaky, and passive aggressive again and I knew he was about to discard me so I beat him to the punch, basically.  I blocked him via text and Whatsapp without an explanation - no need for one, as he knew exactly what he was doing and I wasn't going to stick around for another round of his shit.\n\nThis morning I got a text from a +44 phone number which is a UK phone. I live in the US and have a US phone number.  The text read:\n\n*\"I'm in the unit are u able to see me or shall i carry on to stanley pk\"*\n\nI replied an hr later: *Who is this?*\n\nThey replied back 6 min later: *Sorry ignore my message*\n\nAt first glance, I figured this was just a misfired text from a stranger.  Then I started thinking how odd it would be to accidentally text someone in the US when you're in the UK.  How you'd have to dial the country code in order for it to work.  Like, who just accidentally texts an international number? I know it happens but I rarely get accidental texts and never ever from a foreign number.\n\n**Then, I remembered the ONLY time a +44 UK number has EVER texted me was the first time I blocked the Narc, a year ago after the first discard**.  At that point I didn't know he had a 2nd phone but he had reached out from a +44 number to ask why our breakup had to be \"so final\".  I didn't save that number, so no way to know if it's the same one.  But it really got me thinking.  What are the odds?  I'm starting to feel a little paranoid.\n\nOn the other hand, it could truly be an accidental text. I looked up Stanley Park and there is one in the UK. And if it was him, it would mean he had put some thought into hiding his identity and was only texting me to get a response without giving himself away.  My last text to him was while I was away, alone on travel in a dodgy city and he was always the type to worry (maybe fake worry) about my whereabouts and if I was home safe, etc.  I dont know.\n\nAnyway, just in case, I sent back just now:  *\"I know it's you (Narc name).  Goodbye.\"*\n\nDidn't hear anything back.  But feeling freaked out and maybe like I'm going a little crazy.  I don't want to start seeing everything as a sign I'm being stalked but I also don't know if this is a reasonable concern here.

I found this sub a couple weeks ago and I've been lurking ever since. In that time, I've read quite a few  posts and I just want to say that I'm sorry a lot of you had to go through the things that you went through. Being here for a bit has really opened up my eyes to how cruel some people can be. To me, my situation feels selfish in comparison, but I feel like I've been suppressing it for years and it has not been great for my long term health. So today, I thought I'd vent for once.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave any of you watched the HBO Documentary State of Play: Trophy Kids? It's a documentary about overbearing sports parents and the potentially abusive relationships they have with their kids. If you're curious, here's a link to the whole thing on vimeo: [https:\/\/vimeo.com\/108600855](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/108600855)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I first watched it when I was 17 out of pure curiosity. Going through it, I was disgusted by the parents. They were clearly abusing their children mentally and all of them seemed bat-shit crazy. All of them... except for the Football dad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time, nothing about the football dad seemed out of the ordinary to me and he seemed so out of place with the rest of the parents. In fact, everything I was seeing was so eerily familiar. I recognized the early morning 1 on 1 talk-downs at practice, the car rides home about my failures and my dad's financial investment, the talks of me committing suicide if I were to quit, the fear of fucking up in practice because of my dad's (what I now see as) bullying. Everything about that situation was me down to a tee, except with baseball. One of two big differences was that my parents were still together. In the documentary, the kid (Justus) was living with his separated mother before he moved down to live with his dad at 14-15. For me, that relationship with my father goes back for as long as I can remember. The second big difference was that Justus quit football and moved back in with his mother the next year. I had no such option.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWatching it today, it still feels normal to me. But knowing what I know now, I can see that it was wrong. Everywhere I've seen this documentary posted, I see people calling out the football dad as one of the worst and it's such a jarring experience for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad always wanted me to be a major league baseball player. *Always*. In my baby album, he has it down as the thing he wishes for me the most when I grow up. Ever since I was a toddler, I've had a bat in my hand. I played one year of tee ball, then skipped the next two years because my dad was already pitching to me at the time in our own 1 on 1 practices, and he saw tee ball as a waste at that point. When I turned 9, things got a little more serious when I joined a rookie ball team. Outside of team practices, we would hit continuously and train at the track for 4-5 days a week during the summer. At this point, I remember my dad getting more and more pissed at me when ever I wouldn't preform, but not in a straight forward way. Like the football dad, he was never the type to yell at umpires or coaches. He would mumble under his breath as he watched (lots of which is caught on camera when he used to film my at bats to analyse my swing), and then later, have an hour discussion with me on the way home about how I fucked up, what I needed to work on, why I wasn't listening to him, etc. In 1 on 1 practices, he'd be more upfront. At first he never yelled at me, but after a while, he found loopholes to figure out a way to justify yelling at me without making it about my performance. If I didn't do well, he would blame it on video games. He would say that, instead of listening to him in practice, I was thinking about hanging out with my friends, and I was *choosing* not to focus. He eventually built up this delusion that video games were ruining my eyes, and even playing for an hour *days* before a game or practice would make me significantly worse. This was something I believed all the way up until I was 17.\n\nMy dad labelled me as a video game addict (even though I had great marks and played a lot less than my friends, or even my sister, ever did). Because of this, I began to get grounded for long periods of time. There were 2-4 month periods when he wouldn't allow me to go out with friends because he assumed I was going out just to play video games. Even whilst I was grounded, my dad would still blame my baseball failures on video games because I was \"thinking about my friends\".\n\nChristmas presents became all baseball training equipment. My dad showed no interest in anything else I was doing, or anything I was interested in. I would never go to practice for myself, and I would *never* watch baseball games on the TV, so my dad knew I hated it. But it didn't matter. My marks started dropping in high school after I joined a traveling team hours away and my academic blunders helped keep me grounded for even longer periods of time. Games were no longer an option in the house.\n\nMy biggest regret in life by far is not quitting baseball before the age of 16. Before that, I felt like my mom was just enabling my dad's actions. Even so, she didn't feel like any sort of threat, or feel like she was against me. Same thing with my older sister. The only one who 100% believed I could be a major league baseball player was my dad. That all changed when I went to my first MLB showcase that summer. A ton of scouts were interested in me. The reality of a signing bonus slipped into everyone's heads. All of a sudden I had agents representing me, I was on the projected draft list, and I was doing more training than ever. I tried to quit multiple times during this period, but my parents wouldn't let me. The financial prospect was too great and if I even brought it up, my dad would completely stop talking to me and perma-ground me from everything. But ignore the fact that my parents began pouring their savings into my ball like I was a glorified lotto ticket, it was all for \\*me\\* \/s.\n\nEverything was falling apart by the time of the draft. I had scouts, my parents and my agents relying on me to succeed, but nothing was working. My mental health was degrading, I was extremely suicidal at the time, my performance was faltering, and I was barely passing school. All of that contributed to me not getting drafted in 2014. Either way, I still had the opportunity to go down to a southern college on my parents money to try for the draft another year, but I had had enough. I knew that if I went down, I wouldn't go to the games without my dad's constant push, I'd be kicked out of school, and I'd be homeless. I had no job experience because my dad forbid me from having one so I could focus on ball. I asked to take a lap year of highschool to try for the draft the next year and my dad said no. So I finally quit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was kicked out multiple times after this, spent some nights on the street because my anxiety was too out of control to even ask a friend to sleep at their house, then came crawling back both times. My dad threatened to call the police on me, then began researching the laws behind evicting someone. Once he figured out that evicting someone according to law was more complicated than just booting them out, he backed down because he didn't want to communicate with others about our situation. Image was very important for him. During this time, my dad straight out stopped talking to me and my mom became the nastiest person I had ever met because I was still in the house without a job yet. She would throw fits on me daily and create excuses just to do so. I remember one day she came storming downstairs because her computer wasn't working and threatened to kill me because she thought my friends were hacking into the computer. Another time she walked into my room at 3am and just stood in the doorway for a half an hour before starting an argument. I was very paranoid about her for a while.\n\nFast forward and now I'm 22 and still in the house. I've had a couple jobs that I haven't been able to hold on to because of anxiety issues and panic attacks. I've been paying my rent, but my relationship with my parents has been terrible. Regardless, we have had a few talks and I began seeing a psychologist a few weeks ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, up until this point in my life, I feel like I've been suppressing my emotions about my past. I genuinely do mean it when I say I don't think my dad's a bad guy. He grew up in a lower class and his mom never supported him in his baseball, and he always thought he would have made it to the majors if she had. His ideal image of him being a father was doing the polar opposite. I don't think there was ever a time that I was truly angry at them, just angry at myself. but I wonder if that was even healthy for my development. Like I said, I've been dealing with anxiety issues that I don't understand at all. I never went to parties, I never snuck out. I never drank or did drugs. I'm 6'3, and I guess I'm decently attractive but I've never had it in me to engage in a relationship with anyone, let alone even a kiss. I'm constantly in panic mode over seemingly nothing, I struggle to find any sense of self, and I'm just sitting here, spinning my wheels and rotting away. Honestly, if it wasn't for the prospect of leaving the house and going to college on a full mature student loan (I qualify next year), I would have killed myself a while ago. But that's there, so I decided to do therapy.\n\nThis past week, my mood has been all over the place from going to my third therapy session. I've finally taken a closer look at the past and I think my dad exhibited a lot of narcissistic behavior (this is my own conclusion, not my therapists). Even though I still don't hate him at all, I'm now getting these things that feel like panic attacks, but just filled with anger that's not directed at anyone in particular, and a lot of tears. For five seconds, I'll feel like putting my fist through the dry wall, and then it'll completely go away. I've already punched my dresser a few times. I can drown out those thoughts with music and what not, but I feel like that's what I've been doing my whole life and I've done nothing but make my anxiety worse.\n\nSo yeah, that's what's going on with me. I wished to end that on a better not, but I don't really have much else to say. I really just wanted to vent about this stuff for once and try and consolidate my thoughts on paper.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_subscribers":357926,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I was raised to be a professional baseball player by my Ndad","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/9t5h7n\/i_was_raised_to_be_a_professional_baseball_player\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I dated my high school girlfriend for four years-- high school through most of college. A memory just resurfaced that's left me questioning my morality as a whole and the best steps for accountability. The assault didn't occur during the relationship, but rather prior to- at a party. I'm struggling to figure out next steps for taking accountability for what I did and hopefully best atone to my ex for my actions.\n\nFrom all of my memories the relationship as a whole was healthy, we lost our virginities together, sex was alway consensual, clear communication about feelings, and things ended on good terms. We've caught up over coffee several times since splitting nearly 4 years ago and text messages between the two of us always involve smiley faces. We've supported each others respective career successes\/accomplishments, etc. I only mention all of this because it plays into my uncertainly of how to and if it's best reach out to her and offer an apology.\n\nAt some point, I don't recall exactly when my guess is about 2 1\/2 years into the relationship while we were in college together she told me how at a party during high school a couple months before we started dating I had felt her up non consensually. We were both sleeping near each other as the night winded down and I moved one of my hands onto her waist line and and started to move down towards her groin before ultimately stopping. A memory I don't recall, but I'm SURE happened. It would have been the first time I was drinking heavily and it's the only time I've ever really been truly blackout drunk. WHICH IS NOT AN EXCUSE and by no means makes my actions less disgusting- its simply why I wouldn't remember the end of the night.\n\nAt the time of her telling me I remember apologizing. Her saying \"it's ok you were just being a boy.\" Saying \"I'm so sorry it's not ok that I did that.\" After the conversation it never came up again. I think I must have just pushed it into my subconscious to avoid facing what that really meant and hadn't thought of it once until this week. I only remembered since I'd reached out to catch up over the phone- which she had responded excitedly \"Yes it's been far too long!!\"\n\nLast night the memory of her telling me what I had done rushed back and I was hit with waves of guilt both for completely lacking the maturity in the moment to recognize how hard of a conversation that must have been to bring up, really taking accountability in the moment for how serious my actions were, and  asking if she was ok\/what I could do if anything. I'm afraid she only forgave me in the moment out of kindness and because we were still together. I'm now looking back at our entire relationship and it feels like it was all built upon a lie because of what I did to her. I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive myself for doing that to anyone let alone one of the only people in my life that has given me nothing but love and support. And if I'm hurting now I can only imagine the pain, fear, and trauma my actions caused her. More than anything I just want her to be happy and to know nothing was her fault.\n\nThe last year or so in particular I've been really working to educate myself about the #MeToo movement, read about the trauma assaults cause, and have had women I've dated share stories of their rape. I've seen first hand the damage it causes and I'm disgusted with how selfish and damaging my actions were. I don't how I suppressed this memory for so long.\n\nI would like to apologize to her again, but I don't want to retraumatize her- especially as she is at the tail of a very challenging academic pursuit and appears from the outside to be doing well and in a happy new realtionshipl. I don't want to anything I do to cause her further harm and derail her before she graduates. But I also know there is no \"good time\" to apologize for assaulting someone and am afraid I'm avoiding the apology not because it is the least harmful path but out of cowardice and for selfishly not wanting to bring to light the gravity of my actions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTDLR: I just realized I sexually assaulted my ex GF before we started a 4 year relationship that ended on good terms and I don't know the right steps toward seeking accountability.

I dated my high school girlfriend for four years-- high school through most of college. A memory just resurfaced that's left me questioning my morality as a whole and the best steps for accountability. The assault didn't occur during the relationship, but rather prior to- at a party. I'm struggling to figure out next steps for taking accountability for what I did and hopefully best atone to my ex for my actions.\n\nFrom all of my memories the relationship as a whole was healthy, we lost our virginities together, sex was alway consensual, clear communication about feelings, and things ended on good terms. We've caught up over coffee several times since splitting nearly 4 years ago and text messages between the two of us always involve smiley faces. We've supported each others respective career successes\/accomplishments, etc. I only mention all of this because it plays into my uncertainly of how to and if it's best reach out to her and offer an apology.\n\nAt some point, I don't recall exactly when my guess is about 2 1\/2 years into the relationship while we were in college together she told me how at a party during high school a couple months before we started dating I had felt her up non consensually. We were both sleeping near each other as the night winded down and I moved one of my hands onto her waist line and and started to move down towards her groin before ultimately stopping. A memory I don't recall, but I'm SURE happened. It would have been the first time I was drinking heavily and it's the only time I've ever really been truly blackout drunk. WHICH IS NOT AN EXCUSE and by no means makes my actions less disgusting- its simply why I wouldn't remember the end of the night.\n\nAt the time of her telling me I remember apologizing. Her saying \"it's ok you were just being a boy.\" Saying \"I'm so sorry it's not ok that I did that.\" After the conversation it never came up again. I think I must have just pushed it into my subconscious to avoid facing what that really meant and hadn't thought of it once until this week. I only remembered since I'd reached out to catch up over the phone- which she had responded excitedly \"Yes it's been far too long!!\"\n\nLast night the memory of her telling me what I had done rushed back and I was hit with waves of guilt both for completely lacking the maturity in the moment to recognize how hard of a conversation that must have been to bring up, really taking accountability in the moment for how serious my actions were, and asking if she was ok\/what I could do if anything. I'm afraid she only forgave me in the moment out of kindness and because we were still together. I'm now looking back at our entire relationship and it feels like it was all built upon a lie because of what I did to her. I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive myself for doing that to anyone let alone one of the only people in my life that has given me nothing but love and support. And if I'm hurting now I can only imagine the pain, fear, and trauma my actions caused her. More than anything I just want her to be happy and to know nothing was her fault.\n\nThe last year or so in particular I've been really working to educate myself about the #MeToo movement, read about the trauma assaults cause, and have had women I've dated share stories of their rape. I've seen first hand the damage it causes and I'm disgusted with how selfish and damaging my actions were. I don't how I suppressed this memory for so long.\n\nI would like to apologize to her again, but I don't want to retraumatize her- especially as she is at the tail of a very challenging academic pursuit and appears from the outside to be doing well and in a happy new realtionshipl. I don't want to anything I do to cause her further harm and derail her before she graduates. But I also know there is no \"good time\" to apologize for assaulting someone and am afraid I'm avoiding the apology not because it is the least harmful path but out of cowardice and for selfishly not wanting to bring to light the gravity of my actions.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"confessions","subreddit_id":"t5_2qq6g","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/confessions","subreddit_subscribers":367499,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Just realizing I sexually assaulted my high school girl friend.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/confessions\/comments\/9t5or4\/just_realizing_i_sexually_assaulted_my_high\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

I've attached my Kinklist at   the bottom here, so   feel free to take a look and see if anything   tickles your fancy.\n\n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/j5JD2Sn](https:\/\/imgur.com\/j5JD2Sn)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dirtypenpals","subreddit_subscribers":152775,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M4A] Lets Do Almost Anything and Talk About Nearly Everything!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtypenpals\/comments\/9t5oyn\/m4a_lets_do_almost_anything_and_talk_about_nearly\/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}

I didn't really think much of it until today when I accidentally dropped a ceramic bowl in the kitchen. I used it to cover a cup with instant noodles and hot water in it. I lifted the bowl to see if the noodles were ready to eat and I dropped it and it shattered on the floor.\n\nAbout a few weeks ago I pumped air into my bicycle tyres and I must have pumped in too much because the back tyres exploded maybe 10 minutes after I started riding the bike. I really wanted soymilk from the convenience store. I ended up walking my bike to the store to get soymilk and walk it back home.\n\nI was making food for my cat. I was roasting chicken in a countertop oven. It was raining and because I'm a dumbass I didn't care. I really needed food for my cat. I saw light flashing off in the oven then I noticed the chicken wasn't done even after a long time. My mom was nearby but she didn't see the flashing in the oven but she said there was lightning earlier and that must have been what broke the oven. I ended up cooking the chicken on stovetop. Cat was fed. All good. Oven still not working, though.\n\nAnother time I was doing the dishes (also in the kitchen, again) and after washing a wooden chopping board I always put it over stovetop on super low flame to kill bacteria. I did one side, flipped the board to do the other when I noticed my cat hadn't come inside the house and it was kinda late. So I went outside to look for her. I found her and brought her inside and went back to the kitchen. I saw the chopping block still on the stove with flame under it so I rushed to it and turn off the fire. One side of it is now blackened.\n\nTwo days ago I was boiling water over the stove in a small steel bowl with no heatproof handle. I remember wanting it to boil quickly so I turned the heat up to max. I usually use oven mitts to carry this bowl and never had a problem. When the water was boiled I could find only one mitt so I grabbed a rag nearby to substitute for the missing mitt to carry the bowl. The rag melted into the steel and my fingers were burned a little. I can't get the melted and now hardened rag out of the bowl.\n\nToday's bowl breakage is just the latest in the series of accidents that I have caused for the past few weeks. As I'm typing this post I realize all of them are food-related. I don't know why I've been so absent-minded lately. Only medication I'm on is Zoloft for my anxiety but I've been taking it for years without any problems. I'm 31 years old male and not unhealthy. I'm chubby but not overweight. I eat and sleep okay. No problems with insomnia for a long time now. I really didn't think much of it before but I'm starting to scare myself.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"NoStupidQuestions","subreddit_id":"t5_2w844","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/NoStupidQuestions","subreddit_subscribers":854279,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I've become accident-prone lately.

This day, I came to save someone\u2019s life is called the Good Samaritan. I learned that it was my ex who is trying to hurt himself while he\u2019s high on medicine. I was asleep at home at this time when he has texted me some messages says he was going to kill himself. I was woken up with crazy message texts that he\u2019s going to end his life. I had to get up and run to check on him. According I took behind the wheels to fetch his help not so far from where I lived. Even we broke up I thought him as a friend. When I drove to his house a studio small room where he stays downstairs I have tried to knock his windows a few time you can hear it. I waited for like ten minutes no responses. \nHe has admitted me that his mother is trying to set me up and wanted me to go to to jail in revenge. Because I did it to him while he was living with me in Hawaii. He has abused me with using the mirror and hit me in the face and he never asked if I was ok. I went to the hospital alone and had to report it to the police. It\u2019s when mother\u2019s revenge boiled. At this hour, when I was leaving from his studio. The police were sitting by the block the whole time and try to capture me. I left I a peace and drove away in a town area. I never hurt anyone or make scenes. I drove it away and the police were like 2 seconds after me after the stop sign.  They pulled me over and asked me a lot of question. Why I was speeding.  How can they be accurately know how I speed in such a short period of time? They asked me to do in a line walk I did it beautifully. They kept pushing me I told them I am trying to save a person life. They got really dirty with me and forced me to get into the police\u2019s car because I am deaf. Life is somewhat scary because I never experienced this before and sent me to jail because they say I was intoxicated. Which is not true. \n\nI have done my research and the police made me to take the breathalyzer four times. As I am aware that is not an actuate way to measure my blood alcohol, if I go to trail and there only evidence of my blood. If I comply with a breathalyzer at the scene and never got a blood test with a needle they can't prove I was drunk. When I get a license I signed to agree to get tested for alcohol at the scene if I declined they will take my license and waive my right to the trail.  So I needed your advice to help me to get my case.\nI feel helpless and help me go through this phrase. Please help me here thanks. It begins in Sacramento where I just moved there.

How did he *do this so well?*\n\nThings like earning TP from defending, but Kris doesn't use TP, but Ralsei doesn't act- so Kris will act in a way that lets you pacify an enemy, but Ralsei needs to defend to get TP to do that in the first place. Then you get attacked, and can earn extra TP by being dangerous with your moves. Then on the next turn, Kris defends to get more TP to get more money, and Ralsei uses TP to pacify!\n\nThen in another battle, if Kris has made an enemy spare-able, on the next turn, you can defend with Kris rather than spare, and use Ralsei to spare, thus getting you more TP and money than if you had told Kris to spare first. \n\nAnd the way a single enemy has multiple movesets, but two of the same enemy *uses both movesets at once*, and every single turn the enemies attack as a unit. Can you imagine the work that goes into making those sorts of attacks for an entire game worth of enemies?\n\nAnd this is just basic combat.

The title just contains some examples of what I'd be interested in. As it says I'd like you to pick your own poison, not just out of my kinks but everything that's not a limit for me (see the last lines) and let me know it so we can come up with an idea together.\n\nA few words about myself. I'm 22, from central Europe (I'm happy to write German as well) and I've got nearly 9 years of experience writing roleplays and obviously I started with non-sexual ones back then.\n\nWhat would I want to know from you? I'm glad you asked:\n\nRole Play perspective: 1st or 3rd person?\n\nPost length\/frequency: How long and often would like to write? I'm open for everything from at least a few sentences to multiple paragraphs, just don't expect me to write a thousand words per post ten times a day. I've still got things to do which aren't writing. If course it's not set in stone but very much flexible for changing situations. Just a rough outline.\n\nRP-lenght: As I said, I'm open for short term and (very) long term roleplays as well as everything in between.\n\nPreffered writing site: If you prefer something else then PM's to write just let me know. I'm open to everything from chats\/IM's to bulletboards. (Or whatever else you might prefer)\n\nPreferences regarding my, your or other characters: Looks, styles, psychological traits, race (be it raceplay or fanatasy-races), relations, jobs etc. Yes I'd be open to playing multiple characters as well.\n\nSetting: Would you like a real world setting or something more exotic? Something historic or futuristic? Just be aware, I'm European myself and even if I see myself as somewhat knowledgeable about other cultures as well I obviously have my limits. I'd still be happy to try something in e.g. ancient Asia or America in the 19th century but my lack of knowledge might lower the quality.\n\nKinks: Obviously the meat of the game for most people here, just let me know anything you might like to include. A few more of my own which weren't in the title would be sexy\/slutty clothing, toys, pleasure\/orgasm control, senseplay, foodplay, sloppy, and supernatural powers. Oh and I might be developing a thing for Asians, I blame anime for this as well as for my preference for long legs...\n\nLast but not least, Limits: Toiletplay and snuff are right out. Not interested. Blood, Gore, Torture and death are a limit only in a sexual way but can still be part of the roleplay if it fits our setting otherwise. Meaning, I won't play a member of the Spanish inquisition (bet you didn't expect this now.) torturing a character played by you before, after or while fucking her but we can write about the torture happening while the characters are both not tortured. Which reminds me, I'm also not really a fan of rape. Neither receiving nor executing.\n\nI hope to hear from you, grg.\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dirtypenpals","subreddit_subscribers":152776,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[Futa4F] Romance?
