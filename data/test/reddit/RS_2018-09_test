He sent me pictures of photocopies of the checks. The checks were still in his checkbook, I could see the crease and a portion of a check on the other side. No proof they were ever cashed.\n\nI researched the checks further and discovered they were written out to the current tenants of the property I was renting. I highly doubt he payed his current tenants to clean their own yard and house.\n\nI drove by the property 2 days after I recieved the pictures and discovered the lawn was totally overgrown, there is no way yard work was done on this property.\n\nOn day 53 I sent another letter asking for my deposit back. I also explained in the letter that he was 23 days passed the 30 day due date in which the deposit must be returned to the tenant, and because of that he is required to refund the full amount of the deposit.\n\nHe sent me a letter in reply saying that he \"refutes all claims made in the letter send on August 23rd.\" Along with a check for the $300 remaining in the deposit written out to 5 people, 1 of which did not even pay any of the original deposit, as he moved in when one of the original roomates moved out.\n\nI really want to take him to court. I'm 21 and have never been to court, but besides the fishy reciepts and checks, and proof that he did not complete yard work as he claims to have, Am I grounds to win and recieve the full amount of my deposit back based solely on the fact that he was 23 days late?\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"legaladvice","subreddit_id":"t5_2rawz","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/legaladvice","subreddit_subscribers":555881,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[US - NH] Landlord was 31 days passed the 30 day limit in which the security deposit is required to be returned to the tenant by.

So I had to repost this a few times because other subreddits kept taking it down and other subscribers to this sub told me to just post it here  so that's what I'm  doing now. Enjoy\n\n Had to repost this since &gt; tHe FoRmAtInG iS uNrEaDabLe&lt; or something. Anyways, here it is. \n\nThis is a personal expierence, or it could have been... maybe. As a warning ignore all my spelling, gramatical, and sentence construction mistakes. I failed English 3 times, it's not my fault I'm more of a math and science kind of guy. Also you'll probably see way to many commas. \n\nAnyways, for some context, have you ever recalled an old memory maybe from your early childhood that you could of sworn really happened but as you grew older, I'm 19 now I'm case youre wondering, you started convincing yourself that it had to be a dream. There was just no way that could of happened, or maybe you really hope that it didnt. Well this happened to me and I wanted to share it and see if anyone can shine some light on it or reassure me that it was a dream. \n\nSo when I was about 4ish my family and I used to live in a kind of big house in the suburbs near Chicago, near Chicago meaning over an hour drive maybe an hour if you're driving on weeknight at 1am and have luck on your side. \n\nI had a lot of good memories in that house but the more I think back the more unsettling it becomes, other members of my family have weird occurances that could possibly tie in with mine but maybe we'll save that for another time since I'm starting to ramble. \n\nSo getting back to the story, some important info is that back then i didnt have my own room, I slept in my parents room most nights. Also, me and my dad loved sleeping inn the cold we just can't stand the heat. So on hot nights we would sleep on the floor so it was colder while my mom slept on the bed since she's always hated the cold and prefers warm weather. \n\nSo for a while leading up to when this happened my mom had been complaining about her back hurting and waking up in pain in the morning, the words that stuck out to me were \" it felt like someone heavy had been sitting on me all night \" or something like that but I'm Spanish. \n\nSo getting to it now after going to bed with my dad on the floor, since it was a hot night, I had woken at some point in the night. And for some reason I thought that i would peek over the edge of the bed and look at my mom real quick just to check on her I guess. \n\nSo I got on my knees to look over the bed and I see this big human shaped shadow, and when I say big I mean big like it's head almost touched the ceiling, and it was just staring down at my mother in bed. I quickly ducked down behind the bed and covered my mouth. For some stupid reason I decided to steal another glace instead of waking up my dad, but when I looked I saw the shadow dead ass sitting on my mom staring blankly out the window and that's about when the memory ended. Its not that I can't remember I just never had any memory of what happened after that. \n\nI guessed I passed out because I ended up waking up at night time the next day like I had slept for almost a while day. I quickly ran downstairs to then kitchen ecstatic to tell my mom what i had seen and why her back hurt but my memory ends there for that time. All I remember is my family looking at me weirdly because I just ran in there screaming at my mother that I knew why her back hurt and then blank I have no more memory. \n\nI have stories of my mom being cursed by her old mother in law\/ my older half brother and sister's grandma who was supposedly a witch of you believe in that sorta stuff. Also supposedly my older sister's great aunt or something was trying to contact her even tho shes been long dead. \n\nAnyways if you have similar experiences or can help me with mine thatd be grate.

Ive known i was gay since i was 5. Although i grew up going to church, for a little while as a baptist christian, I've only known Jesus for 10 months or so. Another fact about my already oxymoronic (for lack of a better word) life is, I am 35 year old black male From Pennsylvania who recently moved to Georgia and am attracted to white males. In my younger days being gay, black, and attracted to white men was not to much of a burden, but once i added the christian aspect it seems like my social life disappeared. I have been going through spiritual warfare (awareness of it) for three years. So being christian and going through spiritual warfare has crippled me and i have no outlet or anyone i can talk to or confide in about my situation and experiences. I've tried going to different churches even gay ones but the things that are revealed to me makes me aware of false prophets or deceitful people with clarity. Because of the way i'm treated and the things i experience, it makes it hard to meet new people. My question is, does anyone know of any true gay-christian social groups, churches, and\/or meetings or counselors, life coaches, and\/or mentors where i can maybe connect or talk with someone for support? If you know anything about spiritual warfare and the isolation that comes with it, combined with a subculture that has its own personal war with christianity, besides Jesus, you can imagine how alone I am. I'm not being prideful when i say this but i would consider myself attractive. I am\/was a social butterfly before the warfare began. I had tons of friends and have experienced many things in my life. I was also in an 11 year relationship. I say all this to say, this new found isolation has nothing to do with my social skills or lack thereof, which makes this chapter in my life more painful. If there is anyone out there who can remotely relate or have any suggestions at all, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you and God Bless.\n\nPS. \u201cHate the sin and not the sinner.\u201d Now that I am a practicing Christian, I do not fornicate as that is one of GODs law, which means I am not sinning just because I identify as homosexual. So if you are able to help me regardless of my or your sexual orientation please reach out. I am against all New Age movement so not hear to deceive anyone into accepting my sexual orientation, just someone, anyone who loves GOD has compassion and want to talk about Jesus and his love and how we are no longer of the world, just in it.

My name is Tanner, but I am not actually that tan, unfortunately. I could just blame that on the often cloudy Oregon weather, but really it is just just genetics. I am 5'9, which I wish was a few inches taller... but I know people far shorter in my family, so I will just be thankful for what I got. I am also single, so if that's something that floats your boat, then maybe we can hit it off.\n\nMy interests are incredibly varied, and I am always learning to appreciate new things. Movies, television, music, podcasts, video games, and the occasional book, I enjoy them all! It doesn't matter what genre generally, as long as it is good. Hell, even some things that aren't considered \"good\" I have enjoyed before! \n\nI absolutely love talking to people and getting to know them, as well as letting them get to know me. In my opinion, I am a fantastic person to talk with! I am a very naturally curious person. I nearly never write short messages and will absolutely not write back with a single word. Honestly, if anything, I ramble a bit... but that's better than the inverse, right? I'm a goof, so I love to make make people laugh and brighten their day a bit. If you just need someone to listen while you vent, I can be that person as well. I've always been fairly intuitive and empathetic, which has helped me connect with others in the past. No matter what your interests are, I am curious to learn more about them. Even if it's not something it seems like I would be into, well, try me!\n\nTL;DR: I find myself to be a better than I average conversationalist, so if you would like to make a new friend, or more possibly, who can actually hold a conversation, then hit up my inbox! Or we can talk on any other messaging app you may prefer.\n\nIf you have a difficult time not knowing what to say at first, just simply tell me about something you have been enjoying watching, playing, listening to, or doing lately.

Let me give you a little more details into some of these aspects of me. First the crossdressing, I've always found wearing woman's clothes as a turn on, but it has evolved over the years. But have been curious to know what its like to be, feel and act feminine. I have always had an attraction to men, but the attraction is more in line with the dominance men can have. A fantasy of mine that I play out in my head a lot is when a man approaches me and tells me I should start dressing up as a woman and that he would like to assist me with it. I am tentative with it, but he smooth talks me into it. I let him strip me of any masculinity I have and transform me into a woman, but then he also forces me into sucking big cocks  He gives me positive reinforcement that I could pass and gradually I start act and feel like a woman. Now that's just a summary of it, but you get the idea. I read a lot of TG captions and like the ones where a male forces another male to be feminine. I know this probably a lot to read soz.

Whenever I spend time with family, I always get this awkward feeling that I'm wasting my time. They are getting old, but I'm afraid of having regrets when they are no longer alive. What I mean by wasting my time, is that my family judges me as a slightly homophobic father would to his gay son. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo give you an idea of my parents....\n\nMy parents are extremely devout Christians. They only associate with people of the same ethnicity (more on that later) and those who share a similar view on Christianity as them. They consider people who aren't of faith as \"something wrong,\" they have to attribute everything in life to God or some other made up entity. They also only associate with other christians and people of the same ethnicity (korean).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhenever I visit (including relatives), I feel as if I'm the awkward elephant in the room. I don't really enjoy their culture very much as I see it sort of toxic and as a result I question why I even spend time with these people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of the religious difference, my values are completely different than theirs. As hypocritical as this might sound, they blame their own shortcomings on things like the government, bad luck, white privilege, satan, anything EXCEPT for themselves. I hate being around people who express this kind of mentality. \n\nAs an example, when I was 18 I went on a road trip to California with my immediate family. I got pulled over for speeding, even though I was going the same speed as the cars way up ahead of me. I thought, oh well, I just happened to be the one to be caught by his radar. My dad on the other hand is in the passenger seat being extremely passive aggressive, saying things like we're being discriminated against, playing the victim card, saying that this ticket is bullshit, etc. I felt pretty embarrassed during the time, and I still facepalm every time my parents say some dumb thing today like when God will give them a new car and new house or that the system favors white people. Consequently, I have to turn down my beliefs and values to an absolute minimal of 0.5\/10 when I'm with them, which I hate doing around people whom I shouldn't have anything to hide from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnough of the gripe, am I an asshole for not spending much time with my parents, relatives, and especially my soon to be deceased grandpa? I know my parents cherish me, perhaps even more than my younger brothers. I seriously hope that I don't come off as conceited, but I'm not so good when it comes to maintaining relationships and thought maybe I could get some bro advice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskMen","subreddit_id":"t5_2s30g","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AskMen","subreddit_subscribers":749500,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Athiests of Askmen, how do you maintain relationships with your extremely religious (christian) family?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskMen\/comments\/9bz3h1\/athiests_of_askmen_how_do_you_maintain\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I have a busy life and I get that. Anybody that looked at my life from the outside in, would just say I need to cut back on some projects and count myself lucky. \n\nI am not OKAY. I'm just not.

And as hard as that is to admit, its even harder to find a solution because it feels like I am doing everything I should already be doing. I occassionally smoke week (very occasionally) typically to deal with my anxiety, late at night after everyone in my house is asleep and I cant stop thinking. It works.

It's always been just me and her, I'm an only child. Could never save money because more than half of every check would go straight to her, then I'd spend the rest on food, cigs, alcohol, trying to still enjoy myself a day or two a week of course.\n\nShe has gotten to the point where she blacks out and gets abusive, just like my Nfather used to. Not beat the shit out of me abusive, but abusive none the less whether it be emotionally or whatever.\n\nI'm not perfect either, but I admit my mistakes. I've always had anger issues myself and when furious I will say some really fucked up dark shit. I never get physical though. Ever. My mother does the same thing but then denies ever saying it afterwards. Now she even gets physical. Then saying I must have \"heard things\" or \"that never happened\".\n\nBut when my Ndad does the same thing and tells me my mother \"brainwashed\" me and \"abuse never happened\", she has told me how he's \"in denial\" of course. But then gets angry when I tell her she does the same thing.\n\nI know what I've seen and heard, and now I've realized both my parents are fucking nuts. It's now to the point where my Nmom just threatens to kick me out if I don't do anything her way. \n\nWhich she knows I have no place to stay, and a shitty broken down car I never would've bought in the first place if I hadn't been so pressed to help her with the bills all these years. She claims I could've fixed it if I didn't spend the little bit of money I have on dumb shit like \"going out\" (which I rarely go out, once or twice a month if that since uh, NO CAR and barely any money). \n\nI also point out to her that if shes so good with planning how to save money, why is it that her house is falling apart and she's several thousands of dollars in debt? Why is the washing machine broken and has been for 10ish years? Why can't she budget since she's the adult and it's her house so she claims? Why do I have to manage my money better than her to fix her house? I have no problem helping out. I love her to death. But this is insane.\n\nAdd to all that she's a hoarder and has way too many animals. But of course when I say anything about it she threatens to kick me out \"if I have such a problem with it\".\n\nI told her fine, I'll do everything her way but I want to see all the bills added up on paper (she never shows actual paperwork to me, just tells me how much the bills are, and I give her whatever she asks for.) I also find it unbelievable that she needs $1400 a month from me in the shitty house we live in with no new car payments or anything of the sort. Plus over the years she has slowly lost my trust by being a manipulative narcassict.\n\nShe told me no, and that if I need to see paperwork to give her $350 a week that I can just move out.\n\nNow I dunno about y'all but I don't know anyone who would agree to paying that kind of money blind (which will be half of what I make in a month IF I get all my hours, which lately I haven't been able to).\n\nI've asked her why it's okay for her to walk all over me and treat me like trash and she claims \"she doesn't, and everything has to be her way because she's the adult and it's her house\".\n\nFor fucks sake I'm 22, but clearly not an adult in her eyes.\n\nAt least she used to \"allow\" me to do what I wanted when I was paying much less. Now she wants me to pay more and abide by even more rules she's come up with.\n\nSo I guess my plan is to do the things I want behind her back until I can move out. Before anyone asks it's nothing bad, having a few drinks alone or at the bar, and smoking weed are the worst things I ever did. Both things my Nmom used to be okay with but no longer is.\n\nNever did hard drugs. Never wanted to.\n\n(TL;DR : Nmom crazy as hell, now demanding I give her $350 a week without question or proof of why she needs that much, and abide by her crazy rules or she'll kick me out.)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_subscribers":307016,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I never should've tried to help my mother.

I'd told her she should have taken him there when he got attacked hey an unidentified animal in the woods a day before I decided to pay her a visit. My dog's disposition had been improving over the week I spent with mom,  but he kept licking his wounds and the large saggy brown tissue on his back was starting to stink.  \n     Mom mentioned that I said we should go to the vet,  but she didn't give me credit that morning,  she said that my mentioning that my dog needed to get a cone for his wound was like prophetic of something that needed to be done hinted at by God,  my mom is REALLY religious.  The trip to the vets was fine.\n     When we got to the vet's he got his cone and was checked for rabies,  had necrotic skin cut off his back, received antibiotics.  Then we got the bill for $400. Then mom got really sour.  Once the vet left the room, mom gave me this really sarcastic remark about how she was paying $400 to take care of my dog,  and that I made her feel like a bad mother for asking to take him to the vet when all he needed was a $15 doggy cone. I said I'd pay for it (credit or no credit he needed to be checked), mom insisted I pay half instead, I offered to pay the whole thing another time but she was steadfast.  \n     She got in the car and then started ranting again,  about how she couldn't keep up with the dog anymore, about how he got put on facebook once because he got out and made her look bad.  She said she wanted to give him away because she has put up with him for too long. \n     About my dog,  he's 16, we've had him since 2004, if mom gave him up odds are he'd be euthanized for being old. But I get why she wouldn't be able to keep up with him,  I left for college,  she only has herself and this one guy she met at an evangelists' meeting who does yard work. I get that losing my beloved dog of 14 years is a part of growing up.  I can accept that. \n     But she wouldn't stop complaining,  even after I told her I wouldn't mind if she gave him up,  she just kept on about how uncontrollable the dog was,  like she was angry at the dog and wanted him to feel bad.\n     As these things tend to do,  they spiraled a bit into unrelated territory.  I recently registered to vote,  but I never received voter information in the mail,  perhaps it was naive of me to not notice but mom brought it up on the way home. \n     She opened the new branch of the conversation with I saw on some paper the town sent in you're registered as a democrat,  don't you know that no good Christian is a part of that party.  In between that and the next thing there was a no ground made argument about the biblical ethics regarding abortion and a small speech about how Hillary Clinton murdered Saddam Hussein for oil.  But I asked to get those papers back and she said she threw them out which means either \n1.) She's telling the truth, hence I'm not getting them back. \n2.) She's lying,  hence I'm not getting them back. \n     She only dropped it when she got the car back to the house and I could walk away. Thank God she eventually dropped the politics and moved back to the dog,  because she had a whole pity party about him bleeding on her blankets including her breaking down into tears. \n     This is no where near the worst thing mom has done,  it's just what pisses me off today. I'm 19 now,  and the 18 years I spent growing up with my mother were hell. While I admit I had more opportunities to escape from her than most people with manipulative parents,  it's always depressing seeing how consistently awful she is to everyone. For context,  my biological father,  (who has been supportive of me since birth (though mom didn't tell me until I was in high school)) had me over the course of an affair he had with my mom who was also married at the time. When I graduated high school mom made him sit in the back of the audience because she wanted to bring her father who, according to her with no evidence for support this,  hates Asian people.  \n     I only come back to see my mom because she signs the financial aid papers I need to get through college and I fear that if I take out loans I will be forced to spend even more time with her, and refusing to sign my papers out of spite is totally something I can see my mom doing. \n    I'm just so sick of her. Everyone tells me to just hold out and keep calm until I graduate college,  but that's exactly what they said when I graduated high school, and those same people who tell me this are family members from whom mom has taken money or has been slandered publicly by her. I begin to feel like the only time I'll get to really tell her off is after she does,  which feels petty and stupid.  I want to tell her that I'm an Atheist and that both the minister she married and my biological father,  a deacon, have both known for years and not cared.  I wanna tell her that Dungeons and Dragons is the best game in the goddamn universe, that the barber she feuded with has been cutting my hair for the last 4 years and that every time she's said my hair looks nice it's because that barber is fantastic.

I'm an extremely calm person, have never done anything physical unless it's playfully.There's a sophomore on my team I'll call Ling Ling. Ling Ling is most likely on the spectrum of autism and is 5'8 120 pounds while I am 6'3 185 pounds. This doesn't stop him from messing up my runs everyday. Everyday before practice, Ling Ling fivestars (basically a five star is where you slap someone and it leaves a five star or five fingers on them) me in the leg leaving a huge ass mark on my calf. I tell Ling Ling to stop everytime he does it, let him know I'm bothered by it, and tell him I'll have to get him back one day if he doesn't stop. A couple of times I've chased him around when the coaches aren't around to get him back, but I give up because it isn't worth it and decide a better day would be during a meet.\n\nOur first meet comes, and per-usual Ling Ling five stars me. This time I'm livid; He potentially messed up my race. He whacked my leg as hard as he normally does, so it leaves a really big five star mark. So, I make a plan to get him back. I wait five minutes for Ling Ling to look away, and I ask my friend if I should give a five star to him. My friend says ye because he knows Ling Ling has been doing it to me every single day and I can't fight back due to just looking like a bully if I do. I wind up from behind him and kinda run into the biggest, hardest five star I've ever given anyone in my life. My hand was blood red and actually hurt I hit him so hard. Ling Ling, on the other hand yells for a good 3 minutes saying how bad it hurts. His leg has the most defined red hand mark I've ever seen even though he's a little darker (making it harder to make out red marks). I felt the sting in my hand for a solid 5 minutes, and he had to run a race with a sting in his leg and an imprint of my hand. My hands returned to normal color like 30 minutes later, and his leg stayed red for the rest of the meet.\nEdit: explaining what a five star is","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"RegularRevenge","subreddit_id":"t5_3b6io","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/RegularRevenge","subreddit_subscribers":23609,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Keep giving me 5 stars every cross country practice?

I'm 26 and I started as a freelancer working in digital marketing about six years ago, namely content and copywriting (people would hire me to write everything from technical documents like manuals and form templates to investigative blog posts). A lot of the time I'd go from one client to another but since I started an LLC in May with the intention to scale, I've been entertaining multiple clients simultaneously with a variety of other things. Web design, SEO, project management -- really whatever the client needed help with from the digital side. However, three months in, I'm already feeling kinda burnt out. I realized that marketing isn't really what I'm passionate about and it was only a small part of what I really wanted to do: help people be successful.\n\n\u200b\n\nBeing gay and having grown up in a conservative family and town, I was consistently devalued as a person. I never really had many people rooting for my success, instead being told that I'll never amount to anything or worse... that it'd be preferred I'd just kill myself rather than live as a gay guy. Despite that, it's made me rather sensitive in wanting to help other people who clearly had potential but were either too scared or demoralized to go ahead with it, whether it was a confidence issue or skills gap. All I knew is that I wanted to help others be their best selves. Having once been homeless, having lost jobs after my bosses found out my orientation, having been in positions where I only have $30 to my name, no food but all these bills were coming due to where I am now (moved cross-country to Washington state and live in a house and can afford living, surrounded by supportive people), I want to prove to people that no matter what their situation, there's always a way to leverage what you have and fight for a better future. I was good at digital media related stuff so that's just been my go-to, but the actual work isn't as fulfilling as I thought it'd be because it wasn't really helping others, just doing the work for them in a system that was already broken\/not doing what it needed to do.\n\nThat said, I've had clients who've said how confident I've made them and how they're reinvigorated with their projects. Or, in instances where I've helped friends and clients with things like resumes or editing their LinkedIn profiles, I live for them smiling and feeling proud of their accomplishments since a lot of the times, we don't really know how to talk about ourselves, let alone in a positive light. And that's kind of the issue I wanted to poll the sub about.\n\nI've already updated my website to reflect my pivot away from just providing digital marketing services (i.e. doing the actual work for them) to consulting on how to find more effective systems for business and living. I'm a believer that work and life are intrinsically intertwined and that the same principles that help an entrepreneur be successful in their businesses can help a non-entrepreneur successful and enjoy life, no matter their work or career goals. That isn't to say I don't want to work with clients... I just want to provide products to people, whether it's my blog where I gamify entrepreneurial habits and success philosophy because I find a lot of millennials complain of boredom or listlessness in trying to be well-adjusted adults... or ecourses on start-up stuff (fundamentals of communication and team building, WA state small business starter kit, stuff like that). I'm an avid believer that with the right motivation and leverage, anyone can be successful despite their current station, though naturally, not everyone has the same journey. With that in mind, I'm already making a list of people I want to interview and talk with about their little creative projects or interesting ways they've built a following or business because like I said, I want to help people and show off how awesome they are. Problem is, I'm kinda struggling on how to show myself off or helping myself in this regard.\n\nI guess my questions though are as follows:\n\n* **As a writer, what's a way I can make money from my writing?** I'm a little hesitant in adding adverts to my posts because I don't want it to look cheap, but at the same time, I need to make revenue somehow. Ideally, I hope that the quality of my posts and my perspective has enough value where I can hopefully guest write or ghostwrite for clients since my biggest problem has been trying to find time to both generate new leads and do the work for my current ones. If my work could be the lead generator too, that'd get two birds stoned at once. I don't mind working with clients, but I just want to be positioned where things I create and produce are my main money maker and services I provide directly for others as secondary. Though I'd love to consult and help people come up with solutions and help them and their team do the work rather than doing the work for them -- if that makes sense.\n* **I know I want to write an ecourse but I have no idea about the logistics of it (what format, how to sell it online, etc.). Are there any resources anyone knows of or examples I can look at to get ideas?** Like I've said, I've written manuals and stuff before and I love teaching.. I just don't really know how to turn it into a product online yet.\n\nI apologize for my rambling but I just kinda needed to vent to others who hopefully understand and have decent insight. Like I said, at the end of the day, I want to help empower people and show them how to apply the creative nature of entrepreneurialism to life, whether it's pursuing building a business or just being successful as they define it. I can share my site too so you have a better understanding of my business and what it looks like now, as well as the content I produce... I just didn't want to seem like I'm spamming or self-promoting when the goal here is just to learn and get ideas.\n\nBut yeah. Hope you all are doing well in your ventures too! It's so awesome to see you all share your stories and thoughts and it's inspiring for me to keep going with mine, even if it's not exactly as I envisioned it. :)","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve posted here a few times; to cut down on the redundancy I&amp;#39;ll keep my background short.

Having once been homeless, having lost jobs after my bosses found out my orientation, having been in positions where I only have $30 to my name, no food but all these bills were coming due to where I am now (moved cross-country to Washington state and live in a house and can afford living, surrounded by supportive people), I want to prove to people that no matter what their situation, there&amp;#39;s always a way to leverage what you have and fight for a better future. I was good at digital media related stuff so that&amp;#39;s just been my go-to, but the actual work isn&amp;#39;t as fulfilling as I thought it&amp;#39;d be because it wasn&amp;#39;t really helping others, just doing the work for them in a system that was already broken\/not doing what it needed to do.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, I&amp;#39;ve had clients who&amp;#39;ve said how confident I&amp;#39;ve made them and how they&amp;#39;re reinvigorated with their projects. Or, in instances where I&amp;#39;ve helped friends and clients with things like resumes or editing their LinkedIn profiles, I live for them smiling and feeling proud of their accomplishments since a lot of the times, we don&amp;#39;t really know how to talk about ourselves, let alone in a positive light. And that&amp;#39;s kind of the issue I wanted to poll the sub about.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve already updated my website to reflect my pivot away from just providing digital marketing services (i.e. doing the actual work for them) to consulting on how to find more effective systems for business and living. I&amp;#39;m a believer that work and life are intrinsically intertwined and that the same principles that help an entrepreneur be successful in their businesses can help a non-entrepreneur successful and enjoy life, no matter their work or career goals. That isn&amp;#39;t to say I don&amp;#39;t want to work with clients... I just want to provide products to people, whether it&amp;#39;s my blog where I gamify entrepreneurial habits and success philosophy because I find a lot of millennials complain of boredom or listlessness in trying to be well-adjusted adults... or ecourses on start-up stuff (fundamentals of communication and team building, WA state small business starter kit, stuff like that). I&amp;#39;m an avid believer that with the right motivation and leverage, anyone can be successful despite their current station, though naturally, not everyone has the same journey. With that in mind, I&amp;#39;m already making a list of people I want to interview and talk with about their little creative projects or interesting ways they&amp;#39;ve built a following or business because like I said, I want to help people and show off how awesome they are. Problem is, I&amp;#39;m kinda struggling on how to show myself off or helping myself in this regard.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess my questions though are as follows:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a writer, what&amp;#39;s a way I can make money from my writing?&lt;\/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m a little hesitant in adding adverts to my posts because I don&amp;#39;t want it to look cheap, but at the same time, I need to make revenue somehow. Ideally, I hope that the quality of my posts and my perspective has enough value where I can hopefully guest write or ghostwrite for clients since my biggest problem has been trying to find time to both generate new leads and do the work for my current ones. If my work could be the lead generator too, that&amp;#39;d get two birds stoned at once. I don&amp;#39;t mind working with clients, but I just want to be positioned where things I create and produce are my main money maker and services I provide directly for others as secondary. Though I&amp;#39;d love to consult and help people come up with solutions and help them and their team do the work rather than doing the work for them -- if that makes sense.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know I want to write an ecourse but I have no idea about the logistics of it (what format, how to sell it online, etc.). Are there any resources anyone knows of or examples I can look at to get ideas?&lt;\/strong&gt; Like I&amp;#39;ve said, I&amp;#39;ve written manuals and stuff before and I love teaching.. I just don&amp;#39;t really know how to turn it into a product online yet.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I apologize for my rambling but I just kinda needed to vent to others who hopefully understand and have decent insight. Like I said, at the end of the day, I want to help empower people and show them how to apply the creative nature of entrepreneurialism to life, whether it&amp;#39;s pursuing building a business or just being successful as they define it. I can share my site too so you have a better understanding of my business and what it looks like now, as well as the content I produce... I just didn&amp;#39;t want to seem like I&amp;#39;m spamming or self-promoting when the goal here is just to learn and get ideas.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yeah. Hope you all are doing well in your ventures too! It&amp;#39;s so awesome to see you all share your stories and thoughts and it&amp;#39;s inspiring for me to keep going with mine, even if it&amp;#39;s not exactly as I envisioned it. :)&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Entrepreneur","subreddit_subscribers":460517,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Opinions on Pivoting My Start-up","ups":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/9bmwwj\/opinions_on_pivoting_my_startup\/","user_reports":[],"view_count":null,"visited":false,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}],"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Entrepreneur","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"hidden":false,"id":"9bziqe","is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":false,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":null,"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"no_follow":true,"num_comments":1,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/business\/comments\/9bziqe\/opinions_on_pivoting_my_startup\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1540057350,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"business","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/business","subreddit_subscribers":428951,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"default","thumbnail_height":140,"thumbnail_width":140,"title":"Opinions on Pivoting My Start-up","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/9bmwwj\/opinions_on_pivoting_my_startup\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I don't know what happened, but today I said \"Fuck it.\"\nNow I'm worried that when the 30 days is up, he won't budge. I am not backing down this time. \nI'm sorry for this long, strange rant, but thank you for reading. I guess I just needed to tell someone. \n\nEdit: I was asked to post some gory details, so I shall. I guess I should state a few things before we get into the shit show that is my life\/writing. This might be long as fuck, depending on how my brain decides to work today. I'm also typing in a phone, so forgive me. I'm not good at writing. I'm 27 and a lady. I have both bipolar disorder and OCD. (&amp; a few other things I won't bore you with.) I have a brother and sister. I'm the oldest. I rent a home with my fiance. My credit card numbers are (just kidding). Okay, is that what we call context? \n\nI should probably describe my dad. I'm not really sure how to. It's insane to me to think that there are other people that exist like him. I understand that he's this way for a reason, but I can't help but hate him. He was also abused, but why couldn't he be stronger? Or did something just break in him? So, he's kind of like this lingering, sick black cloud. Everything he says is completely negative. Nothing is his fault. He's easily one of the most racist human beings I have ever met. He's a huge hypocrite. He's been married three times, but that's not the best part. Every single one of his wives, including my mother, were also abusive narcissists. So, my siblings and I got to endure that. He just let that shit happen. I don't understand. Why have children? We are not little trophies or achievements. We are people. You don't get to have kids just to say you're a good parent. You're not a fucking parent if you don't PARENT. It's in the title, man. I don't mean to sound like I'm throwing myself a pity party, honestly. It's just sometimes I remember things he's done, and I get so angry all over again. Heads up, some of this stuff is pretty fucked, so if you don't want to read it or it may upset you, please don't read. I don't want to make anyone hurt or relive any of their own trauma. Things that I can remember easily are being locked in our rooms, having locks on all the kitchen cabinets, and being wrapped in a towel by my dad before being passed off to my psychotic 1st stepmother to hit me with a belt. The towel was so it wouldn't leave marks. I'm not sure if physical abuse counts here. If it doesn't, I apologize. I can recall another instance in which this same woman and her friends held my maybe 7 year old brother down. They forced barbed wire into his hands, and of course he panicked. He shredded his poor little hands, and they blamed him for not staying still so they could do whatever the fuck it was that they were doing that required forcing a child to squeeze barbed wire. Ndad denies this happened, though we all remember. He says this woman was just \"strict\", and I should look up to her. This is the same woman who cheated on him with a prison inmate, but hey. She's fucking perfect. He had the balls to bring her into my fucking home not two years ago. I was very young when I was abused by her. Elementary school age. I didn't forget, though. Why would anyone think that it's okay to just pretend it didn't happen and bring her into MY home. Not his. He has no home. Not after his third wife, who was a fucking trip in herself. As long as ol dad's gettin' laid, who cares what happens to his kids? I envy people with good parents. I almost resent them. My dad has damn near ruined me, but I'm doing my best. I can't even call him out on anything, because he either blows up like a huge man-baby and stirs what little family I do have into a witch hunt against me, or he does this creepy innocent act. This entails pretending he has no idea what I mean, all while \"apologizing\" by buying shit for me without my knowledge. Or just randomly trying to give me money. I've learned not to take it. It just turns into \"well, I gave you that money and you're ungrateful and blahblahblahisuckasahuman\". \nI often think I wish he'd die. Then I feel sick about it. Why won't my heart allow me that one last part that doesn't hate him yet? I want to completely hate him. I really do, but for some reason, I still am bothered by the thought of him dying. I could deal with never seeing him again, just not his death. Does that make sense? \nSo, there's all that mess. Fast forward to today, and he's living in one of our spare bedrooms. We never told him he could live here. We told him he could stay a few months until he got on his feet. Which, in my opinion, was too kind to begin with. \"Sure! Move in! Remember that one time you made me live with your crazy ex for a year, and I basically just spent it locked in my room eating hungry man dinners? Fuck yeah,you don't! Get your stuff, come on in!\" I don't recall that conversation. Since then, all he does is lie in that room, coughing and screaming the n word into his phone while talking to his other horrid friends. One of them who once told me that if he had the chance, he'd stand on my neck until I died, and he's surprised that my dad didn't. Oh, because I like boys and girls. Dad didn't stand on my neck until I died, but he did call me a \"lesbian cunt\" and cut me out for two years. I stupidly thought I needed his approval then, and eventually crawled back and apologized. For liking girls. Haha. Sorry. I feel like I just starting griping there. Anyway, he's constantly telling us what we should be doing, or insulting our home and the way we live. It's really exhausting, and I've tried every way I can think of to fix this, but it just can't be done. He doesn't believe in mental illness, but expects everyone to cater to him when he's \"anxious and depressed\". I was sent to the psych ward back in January because of a dad-induced breakdown I had, and his reaction when I told him where I'd been was minimal and uncaring. I don't think he's human. All I can do now that I've asked him to go is wait, I guess. Another bridge to cross when I get there. I'm just lucky to have such a supportive fiance. \nI don't know what else I can say, guys. I feel silly for sharing so much, but thanks for reading. I'm sorry it was so long.

When I was not more than 8-9 years my father used to beat me with his shoe and I could still feel the pain he gave to me. My mother never came for my defence as she her self was in a lot of pain than me. At that time I guess my sister's attitude was a bit nicer to me but as the time passed everything changed. My father sometimes abused me and till the age of 10-11 he never allowed me to go out in his presence and sometimes he even used to say that if i went out then he will never let me inside and used to emotionally hurt me a lot by making me read some stories that were about me. He used to compare me with a thief. I really never understood my mother because sometimes she was my best friend but on the other hand sometimes she hurt me like I was a street dog who came to her for coziness and then she kicked me off. I guess she was maintaining distance from all of us (me and my sisters). Today I'm 16 and my life feel like it is at the end of a cliff and there is no way back to move away from falling. My father has stopped paying the bills and he is not even giving his salary to mom but he pays for our education but I guess he will stop paying that too if everything went like that. My mother is fighting him too much nowadays. My father is a business man and he is very good at it. He has a lot of money but he spends it all outside the house for fun. So in order to verify that is his business falling or is he spending the money out, we hired a detective. That detective took $ 211 for 15 days so we got rid of him after paying him. He was quite costly for us. But we got to know from him that my real biological father was sleeping with prostitutes almost at every night and he was characterless and when he said he was going on a business trip he actually went to have fun with his girl gang who were all just prostitutes. You won't believe I've never gone to watch a movie in my whole life to a cinema nor gone somewhere out with my family. Yeah I remember I once went to a park near my house with my family. What a joke? \nTill my class VI when my mind didn't knew much about life I scored the top marks in my class but now I'm half the time sick and my ranks are no near top 20. I feel like I'm dying internally and will never cope up with that. All my ideas and all my aims for the future are just flushing out of me. I feel suicidal but I'm afraid to do that. I don't suicide because I know it will hurt everyone even if they were unfair with me my whole life. I've felt the feeling of when a person whom you had a little trust on suicides. Some years back my mom attempted suicide by eating a bunch of medicine at the same time but luckily we got to save her but the feeling of loosing is very hurting. But the thought of suicide and giving up just doesn't seem to get out off me. I just want to die somewhere peacefully.\n\n\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"offmychest","subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/offmychest","subreddit_subscribers":718038,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My life is stuck and I feel like I can't get out.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/offmychest\/comments\/9bzl8i\/my_life_is_stuck_and_i_feel_like_i_cant_get_out\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

Despite that, it's made me rather sensitive in wanting to help other people who clearly had potential but were either too scared or demoralized to go ahead with it, whether it was a confidence issue or skills gap.

I was good at digital media related stuff so that's just been my go-to, but the actual work isn't as fulfilling as I thought it'd be because it wasn't really helping others, just doing the work for them in a system that was already broken\/not doing what it needed to do.\n\nThat said, I've had clients who've said how confident I've made them and how they're reinvigorated with their projects.

And that's kind of the issue I wanted to poll the sub about.\n\nI've already updated my website to reflect my pivot away from just providing digital marketing services (i.e. doing the actual work for them) to consulting on how to find more effective systems for business and living. I'm a believer that work and life are intrinsically intertwined and that the same principles that help an entrepreneur be successful in their businesses can help a non-entrepreneur successful and enjoy life, no matter their work or career goals. That isn't to say I don't want to work with clients... I just want to provide products to people, whether it's my blog where I gamify entrepreneurial habits and success philosophy because I find a lot of millennials complain of boredom or listlessness in trying to be well-adjusted adults... or ecourses on start-up stuff (fundamentals of communication and team building, WA state small business starter kit, stuff like that). I'm an avid believer that with the right motivation and leverage, anyone can be successful despite their current station, though naturally, not everyone has the same journey. With that in mind, I'm already making a list of people I want to interview and talk with about their little creative projects or interesting ways they've built a following or business because like I said, I want to help people and show off how awesome they are. Problem is, I'm kinda struggling on how to show myself off or helping myself in this regard.\n\nI guess my questions though are as follows:\n\n* **As a writer, what's a way I can make money from my writing?** I'm a little hesitant in adding adverts to my posts because I don't want it to look cheap, but at the same time, I need to make revenue somehow. Ideally, I hope that the quality of my posts and my perspective has enough value where I can hopefully guest write or ghostwrite for clients since my biggest problem has been trying to find time to both generate new leads and do the work for my current ones. If my work could be the lead generator too, that'd get two birds stoned at once. I don't mind working with clients, but I just want to be positioned where things I create and produce are my main money maker and services I provide directly for others as secondary. Though I'd love to consult and help people come up with solutions and help them and their team do the work rather than doing the work for them -- if that makes sense.\n* **I know I want to write an ecourse but I have no idea about the logistics of it (what format, how to sell it online, etc.). Are there any resources anyone knows of or examples I can look at to get ideas?** Like I've said, I've written manuals and stuff before and I love teaching.. I just don't really know how to turn it into a product online yet.\n\nI apologize for my rambling but I just kinda needed to vent to others who hopefully understand and have decent insight. Like I said, at the end of the day, I want to help empower people and show them how to apply the creative nature of entrepreneurialism to life, whether it's pursuing building a business or just being successful as they define it. I can share my site too so you have a better understanding of my business and what it looks like now, as well as the content I produce... I just didn't want to seem like I'm spamming or self-promoting when the goal here is just to learn and get ideas.\n\nBut yeah. Hope you all are doing well in your ventures too! It's so awesome to see you all share your stories and thoughts and it's inspiring for me to keep going with mine, even if it's not exactly as I envisioned it. :)","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve posted here a few times; to cut down on the redundancy I&amp;#39;ll keep my background short.

I don&amp;#39;t mind working with clients, but I just want to be positioned where things I create and produce are my main money maker and services I provide directly for others as secondary. Though I&amp;#39;d love to consult and help people come up with solutions and help them and their team do the work rather than doing the work for them -- if that makes sense.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know I want to write an ecourse but I have no idea about the logistics of it (what format, how to sell it online, etc.). Are there any resources anyone knows of or examples I can look at to get ideas?&lt;\/strong&gt; Like I&amp;#39;ve said, I&amp;#39;ve written manuals and stuff before and I love teaching.. I just don&amp;#39;t really know how to turn it into a product online yet.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I apologize for my rambling but I just kinda needed to vent to others who hopefully understand and have decent insight. Like I said, at the end of the day, I want to help empower people and show them how to apply the creative nature of entrepreneurialism to life, whether it&amp;#39;s pursuing building a business or just being successful as they define it. I can share my site too so you have a better understanding of my business and what it looks like now, as well as the content I produce... I just didn&amp;#39;t want to seem like I&amp;#39;m spamming or self-promoting when the goal here is just to learn and get ideas.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yeah. Hope you all are doing well in your ventures too! It&amp;#39;s so awesome to see you all share your stories and thoughts and it&amp;#39;s inspiring for me to keep going with mine, even if it&amp;#39;s not exactly as I envisioned it. :)&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Entrepreneur","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Entrepreneur","subreddit_subscribers":460520,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Opinions on Pivoting My Start-up","ups":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/9bmwwj\/opinions_on_pivoting_my_startup\/","user_reports":[],"view_count":null,"visited":false,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}],"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Entrepreneur","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"hidden":false,"id":"9bzte6","is_crosspostable":false,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":false,"is_self":false,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":null,"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"no_follow":true,"num_comments":4,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/startups\/comments\/9bzte6\/opinions_on_pivoting_my_startup\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1540057481,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"startups","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh26","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/startups","subreddit_subscribers":289668,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"default","thumbnail_height":140,"thumbnail_width":140,"title":"Opinions on Pivoting My Start-up","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/9bmwwj\/opinions_on_pivoting_my_startup\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Almost killed myself, almost lost my job, I lost my boyfriend. However he is speaking to me again (through texts). We met while I was sober... little did he know... I'm a mean raging drunk. :(\n\nBUT I DIGRESS... I AM 50 days sober once again... and honestly there is no way I am tricking myself into thinking I can be a responsible drinker EVER again because I CANNOT. PLAIN. AND SIMPLE. I've tricked myself TWICE before. Once after 6 months of sobriety and once after 3 months of sobriety. I'm 27, and I've been drinking since I was 17. I have had an extremely sad and hurtful life but I chose to live in the past, and self medicate... but now... this time feels different. I'm moving forward. Staying at home drinking won't help me achieve my dreams. \n\nBiggest accomplishment: I went into the city this month and was able to hang out with my two best friends who I don't get to see often. Ate good food and had some good laughs. They had a few drinks at dinner and this didn't bug me. It's weird sometimes seeing how non alcoholics can just have a glass of wine and that's it... put the cork in the bottle and put it in the fridge. This is when I slipped last time and drank... triggering a couple month long bender. They were totally understanding and my one friend who is a recovered meth addict said she was proud of me.

I had a gap from when I was about 15 to when I was 25. Now that I'm 29, it's worse than it's ever been and I can't seem to stop. It's getting harder to hide it from my husband, who has known about it for about 6 months. He hates when I do it and I hate seeing him so upset when he sees that I've cut again. I broke last night and cut again after telling him I'd stop. With school and work, I'm under so much pressure and my anxiety is like constantly at a 10, so I just wanted some relief. I can hide things fairly well under my knee brace, so that's where they went. I really wanted to just keep going, but I can't go overboard without being noticed. All I want most days is to just slice myself up and down my arms. Since I don't get to do it often, I try to go deeper each time. Some days I really hate that I can't wear skirts or dresses without opaque tights or wear tank tops. Then other days I hate that my scars are fading and I want them to last forever, which makes me want to cut more.\n\nOverall, I wish I could stop. I want to be able to show skin without fear of judgement from my scars. But part of me loves and cherishes them. I just hope that one day I can be a more normal person that can function normally.
