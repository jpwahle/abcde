I'm 33 M, she's 31 F.\n\nAs someone who chose to work things out, its been 5 years since D-Day and its still a constant battle. At least once a week something triggers me about what she did. It could be a song, movie or tv show and when it happens, it hurts every time. She's told me to my face that she's working on herself and trying to process and be better, but how can I ever believe her 100%? Is it possible? Can the love of your life be someone that breaks your heart too?\n\nI'll give her that we weren't our best selves in the months leading up to D Day, but she put the bullet into the head of our comatose marriage. Now our marriage has a giant scar on it. Five years post D Day and a song played at the wrong time can set me back weeks of progress. I want this whole thing to have never happened. My heart hurts and its been FIVE years. I still can't even function on the date of D Day, I'm 0\/5 on not being a wreck that day.\n\nIf she somehow manages to never cheat on me again, that would be okay I guess. Its like, why is that something I should celebrate? \"Yay! It should've never happened in the first fucking place you \\*\\*\\*\\*! Good job on not breaking my heart TWICE\"\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I don't see the big deal with forgiving someone who broke your heart. So basically, she gets a free-pass to hurt me? I wanted to do literally every thought I had after D Day. ALL OF THEM. To me, to her, yes. But I didn't and I won't. Me forgiving her gives her an extra life to process her demons and in return I get a \"better\" version of her? She still looks, talks and sounds like the person who broke my heart. How can I know that a better version of her exists?\n\nFive years and its still haunting me. I'm stuck. I'm still fucking hurt. Its not the 10 it used to be, now its a consistent 4. She's doing, saying and showing me all the things that point to her working on improving herself and our marriage, but there's a hole in our boat and she doesn't want to see it because only she's the one who put it there.\n\nThis sucks.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"survivinginfidelity","subreddit_id":"t5_2x8ez","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/survivinginfidelity","subreddit_subscribers":87113,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Wife cheated on me 5 years ago, I still can't shake it.","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/survivinginfidelity\/comments\/e464h6\/wife_cheated_on_me_5_years_ago_i_still_cant_shake\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I'm open to many different styles whether it be fantasy, or realistic. I have a few ideas in mind but would love to discuss potential ideas. As always come with some ideas and we can get something going.\n\nYour suggestion or ideas: If you have any changes to a particular scenario please share I'm open to suggestions. If you have a totally different idea or ideas please share aswell I'd love to hear.\n\nDragon rider: You come from long line of dragon hunters. One day while on a hunting trip your father and his men a storm knocks you off the ship and into the ocean. You awake in a mysterious land inhabited entirely by dragons. While exploring the new place you stumble upon my cabin.\n\nBartender: I walked in on my girlfriend and bestfriend together in bed. We'd been dating for 5 years so this was a major blow. I leave and immediately go straight to the bar to drown out my sorrows. I sit at the bar and see you asking you for a drink.\n\nBig party small town: So the basic idea for my rp is your from the city and while passing through a small town in Tennessee you and the boy with you (could be son or little brother no preference.) You stop at the local store and see me and a few people putting flyers up for the annual \"redneck rave.\" You ask what it is and after i explain it your son or brother begs you to go and we pick up from there.\n\nSocial media: We're both big on social media from different aspects. One of us invites the other onto their podcast and we talk eventually getting to know each other and become friends and maybe more.\n\nYoutuber house: You're the owner and CEO of an esports team. You've had a team house for a abour a year and are ready to expand. You decide to have a content house you do your research and invite me to join and be the first streamer\/content creator to live in the house with you. Eventually you'll invite others to join.\n\nWhere you come from: We grew up in the same small town in Georgia and were best friends. You moved to California when your dad got an amazing job and you've been living the wealthy life ever since. One day when you come home from shopping with your other rich friends your mom and dad tell you're all going back to Georgia for an extended visit and you couldn't be more upset. \n\nThe new guy: I wasn't the most popular guy at my old school and everyone picked on me. I embarrassed myself one day to the point of needing to get out. After meeting a guy that went through the same situation i reinvented myself as a cool jock type and transferred to your school. \n\nCriminal enterprise: Your mom and my mom were bestfriends. She helped pay for you mom's medicine when she was sick. When your mom finally passed you came to live with us. When you get here you realize we're one of the country's most successful crime families. \n\nSingle parent: This is one is pretty straight forward. We can discuss different options in PM.\n\nUnexpected pregnancy: We met at a party and got drunk and hooked up. We didn't talk afterwards until you called me telling me your pregnant. \n\nSmall town living: you were always a good respectable person. You always saw the good in people but sometimes that wasn't necessarily a good thing. You dated a guy that seemed fine to everyone except behind closed doors he was extremely abusive. When you came home one day with a broken nose and a black eye your parents knew they needed to do something. They decided to send you to live with your aunt to hopefully hide you from him.\u00a0 You were relieved to be away from hom finally. When you get to your aunt's farm you see me working out in the fields. \n\nSuperpower: Ever since i was 5 i knew i was different but no one ever told me why. I came from a long line of shapeshifters unfortunately that's usually what got them killed. Both my dad and uncle were shifters but they mysteriously died when i was 5. My mother started to see the signs of me becoming one the animal print started to show on my body and she knew she couldn't go through with it. When i was 6 she turned me over to foster care and disappeared. Now I'm 22 and using my gift for more personal gain. Rather it be changing into a horse betting on myself at the local track or a championship caliber race dog. You've been passed a file on me to try and bring me in to try and stop a criminal mastermind from trying the world into chaos. \n\nReconnect: I've been bestfriends with your older brother since we were in kindergarten. We're both sophomores in college and play football for the school. You and me always had a connection but never acted on it. Now it's your brother's wedding and we meet up when you see my smoking out by my truck.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Roleplaykik","subreddit_id":"t5_369bo","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Roleplaykik","subreddit_subscribers":48565,"subreddit_type":"restricted","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M4F] Longterm story based rp partner needed.

The upper levels of this city were filled with buildings that reached far above the clouds, so much that they said the sky was filled more with glass than moisture, thoughthat doesn't stop them from erecting more towers to appease the corporations that were viewed as omnipotent by everyone else, and not in a good way....greedy bastards.*\n\n*My corner in the world however, the one that would take me anyway, was the lower levels filled with everything that ranged from desirable to undesirable, and that's just the people I'm talking about. Sex, money, drugs and power, sure they're all readily available in the upper levels but those boring shits love to keep it all hush hush to not seem uncivilised so it wouldn't be for me. The lower levels are \"flexible\", to put it mildly, when it comes to all of the elements of our little dystopia but who am I to argue when they're actually honest about it. *\n\n*I sat down in my usual spot in the nightclub, on the middle floor that overlooked the multiple platforms for the dancers to show what they had in store for the people who just wanted to watch but couldn't have. Some were men, some were women, some were a little bit of both but all of them caught my eye while I downed my drink and checked my account to see the credits flow from my previous extraction job, not that you'll know what means unless I tell you. I glanced around to look for anybody else, either on the dance floor or the bar who'd be up to partake in some late night fun. Maybe you were just hiding in plain sight or maybe you had yet to come but I knew I wasn't leaving this club alone tonight*\n\nHey there! Sorry if that was a long read but hopefully you'll be interested in what I've got to offer. This is basically a cyberpunk styled rp, one that involves us in a nightclub in the lower level of the city. It can go a lot of different ways but it all leads to smut, which is the focus of this rp. Obviously I wouldn't mind if there was some build on up but this is still a kinky and dirty roleplay at the end of the day \ud83d\ude09\n\nJust to give you a little bit of info on myself, my names Josh and I'm 20 years old. I'm usually a dom but I can sub if that's preferred.\n\nKinks wise I'm generally limitless aside from a few obvious ones like scat, rape, piss, gore, vore, vomit and torture.\n\nMy kinks include: I have a pretty big foot fetish (your feet by the way), milfs, nerds, goths or emos, big tits, busty figures, femdom, furries, anthros, sluts, threesomes, rough sex, cum stuffing, light bondage, outdoors, oral, ass play, flexibility, excessive cum, teasing, details, flirting\/dirty talk, kissing, licking, biting, scratching, hair pulling, race play, wet sex, showers, confidence, romance, oil play, clothing and long srps. My main kinks would be the foot fetish, flirting, kissing, teasing and flexibility.\n\nI really hope you're interested. If so then DM me or message me on kik at TheosK1. If you have any further questions then please don't hesitate to ask when you message me. If you have any suggestions or ideas for the roleplay then I'd love to hear them! I'd really like this to turn into something long term if I find the right partner so maybe that'll be you \ud83d\ude09 or you're just really horny and wanna have some smutty fun haha.

I just wanted to let you guys know how I've been going since.  So, I am 90 days without PMO but masturbated about 1 time per week. Here are the key changes I've found.\n\nIncreased self-confidence and self-esteem:Since committing to nofap at the start of September I have subjectively been experience improved self-confidence. In general I am more willing to engage with others and have a more positive outlook on life. My mental health has been better also. I am less self-critical in my own mind but still have high personal standards. In particular I am much less concerned with my physical insecurities especially when talking to other people. I have a long way to go in this area but I'm improving constantly.\n\nBetter athletic performance:  \nI've always found when I refrain from frequent masturbation my athletic performance improves. Over the past 3 months I am running frequently over 20km. Additionally, I had the courage to take up swimming and cycling. Although I have a lot of room for improvement I can swim over 1km in a session and getting confident on the roads while cycling.\n\nFat loss without muscle loss:  \nThe self-discipline that comes through nofap  has translated over to diet. I am stricter with my foods, intermittent fasting daily and refraining from too many carbs. I've gone from roughly 75kg to 71kg at 5'9. I am happy with this progress. developing the strength to control yourself in one area of your life readily translates to other areas of your life.\n\nImproved discipline in personal study:   \nPreviously being bored while studying on the CPU was a big trigger to watch pornography. Now I no longer have the cravings for porn so I am about to focus better while reading and learning on the computer. I am finding I can get through more material with less time and effort. \n\nGreater interest in hobbies:   \nMy interest in my hobbies like athletics, learning  German, and reading have massively improved. I have a genuine desire to pursue these interests, rather than forcing myself to go after them while I was using pornography.\n\nBetter goal-setting:  \nSince quitting pornography I've made some big life choices and self-some massive goals. I've decided to move states for better working opportunities, decided to gain some further working qualifications, signed up for my first triathlon and later my first full Ironman. Additionally, I have been educating myself on financial matters and actively seeking investment opportunities to reach my long-term financial goals. \n\nAreas to improve on:  \nAlthough nofap has help me I still need to work on my ability to socialize generally and particularly with women. I struggle somewhat socially, partly being of low self-confidence, partly because I'm thoughtful, and partly because I'm very goal focused. I've had very limited experience with real women. To be honest nofap hasn't been a magical fix for this area but I believe if I stick with it it will help me be a present partner. Furthermore, with time and continued self-improvement women will be a secondary payoff.\n\nConclusion:  \nReaching 90 days PMO free has been a big personal achievement. It has given a great number of benefits including physical, mental and cognitive. However, nofap is not a magically cure to fix all the problems of your life. It a strong fundamental positive change that will have long-term payoffs if you develop yourself personally and apply the character and self-discipline to other areas of your life. I will continue nofap and hope never to be addicted to pornography again. I will continue to work on all the areas of my life that need improvement. If I can change, you can change.

We are both 48 and have enjoyed an amazing sex life. We tried a variety of sexual activities, including one wife swapping night after a drunken wedding which was fun. Years later, her best friend shared our bed when she stopped over.\n\nBut our greatest sexual adventures were after she bumped into her ex while out shopping. She asked me if they could go for dinner to catch up and denied fancying him when I challenged her. But that was a lie. She later admitted when we were making love and I teased her, that she wanted him. We agreed a system and for the next 15 years, she slept with him fairly regularly and came home and told me everything before we had the greatest sex ever. He didn't have a clue and thought it was a straightforward affair. \n\nBut our best sex was when we were together. Our wedding night was amazing and emotional. We both cried when we came. Two babies showed things down, but only for a while and we were off again. Things were good, they were very good.\n\nThen came a cancer scare which led to a bowel operation and just months later a full hysterectomy. Then another operation to remove part of her vulva. She\/we were 40 years old - 8 years ago. Her recovery was rapid from the triple operations, except for her libido. Plus she could not bear to be touched down there. Various physical\/drug treatments, alternative stuff like yoga and pilates and even counselling and mindfulness have not changed that genital sensitivity. \n\nKnowing it was her libido and not mine that was lacking, she helped me out with her hands occasionally to orgasm, but it was cold and clinical despite being a hugely selfless gesture. I hated it, so we stopped all sex before my 41st birthday. She is doing really well in life now. We both have well paid jobs, we live OK, our kids are amazing and a huge source of light in a marriage that has a permanent black cloud of no sexual intimacy hanging over it. We kiss, we hug and she falls asleep in my arms regularly - ouch!!\n\nBut I miss sex. There I have said it. I deny this all the time to myself and to her, but I am lying. She has said I should seek the services of a working girl and has even sent me links to beautiful women. I couldn't do it, not for her, not for anyone. Maybe I am too in touch with my female side when i say I need to have some intimacy, care and knowledge of the person to really enjoy sex. To use even the sexiest working girl as a hole to get off on is an anathema to my love of sex and lovemaking. I would rather masturbate - and I am serious.\n\nMeanwhile at work I was appointed a new PA 3 years ago. She is now 26 (I am 48). You think you have already worked out where this is heading, but you are wrong. We travel extensively and have lots of down time to talk. She has been unlucky in love with three consecutive partners who were abusive. She knows all about my wife and the sexless situation.\n\nWe nearly slept together after the stereotypical office Xmas party, but she was so drunk - despite her literally begging me to do so, I said no and we simply slept in the same bed hugging each other. This changed everything. She couldn't believe I said no as she was willing and available. She did understand that I wanted her to be able to tell me that sober and would not take advantage of her - despite every cell in my body wanting to. I think she was so used to be taken advantage of, this was a new and rather special thing she was experiencing. A man who respected her.\n\nFrom that evening, we have become really special friends and I really do love her. We have not had sex as its not what we are about- at least not yet. She has sent me photos of her and her and her then BF knowing I will masturbate. That excited her as she has a fetish of being watched. During a recent business trip she discussed how she wanted to invite the hotel barman to our bed for me to watch them. Of course it didn't happen, as he wasn't interested in me being there, but that night she masturbated for me to see and I returned the favour. We sat opposite in bed and she made sure I could see everything.\n\nIts almost inevitable we will have sex. I really don't know if I can hold back any more as she is a very attractive young girl and we do have an amazing connection. But the major\/No 1 thing stopping me is my guilt. \n\nI felt awful lying to my wife after that trip. I have felt awful lying about trips that have not been true, when my wife is at home with the kids. The stupid thing is my wife has met my PA several times and has given me the green light to \u201cdance\u201d with her, as long as I come back to her \u201cbefore I leave the party\u201d. This is the language we used when she was sleeping with her ex.\n\nSo why cant I do it? I have a sexless marriage but a loving one. I adore my wife in ways that I cannot find the words for. She has said I can have sex with this sexy colleague who in turn would do so without warning. So why the hell cant I do it? Should I just bloody do it and stop being a wimp?\n\nI have just re read my words and they sound unbelievable, like a fantasist - but it is a true and is a most bitter sweet situation. I am 48 and have a voracious sexual appetite that has not been sufficed for 8 long years. The truth is I simply cannot give up sex - I just can\u2019t. But I cant make that move even though every door to that nirvana is open for me.\n\nHas anyone been in this bloody ridiculous situation or can identify in any way with my plight?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DeadBedrooms","subreddit_id":"t5_2t25p","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/DeadBedrooms","subreddit_subscribers":239915,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"8 Years in a Sexless Marriage and Despite Permission to Have Sex Elsewhere, I Cant Do It","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DeadBedrooms\/comments\/e46hx0\/8_years_in_a_sexless_marriage_and_despite\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

I've missed a ton of days because in September when I started I was sick quite a bit and due to this I missed a ton of work which I've been trying to catch up on everyday but because of this I'm depressed, stressed and my anxiety is getting the better of me. \n\nI'm also losing my hair and I just feel so down I dont know what to do I've been missing even more days because of how I feel I've been trying to catch up on my work from 7am to 11am every day and I'm exhausted because I'm barely sleeping through an entire night due to stress.\n\nI have 16 days left to complete 2 essays that I still havent done because I've been stuck doing 3 others I've also got an entire art project to do which is creating paintings, sculptures, drawings, print work and photography pieces, an entire sketchbook to update, another book to update with a lot of work, a blog which needs lots doing on it, a folder for research, a uni diary another statement paper for the workshop sessions I've barely gone to because I've been unwell physically and mentally.\n\nMy mind is getting worse and I just feel like crying everyday I dont know what to do. \n\nBecause of my anxiety I can't bring my self to tell my tutor how I feel at the start of the course I did tell him about my anxiety but it's like hes forgotten the first few weeks when i was ill i would email him explaining what's up and he would reply but now when I've emailed him I get no response even when I'm in uni I barely see him or know where he is.\n\nI dont even have any friends and I just feel so lonely and like I'm not even a part of the university. In my space where I work there are 7 other people but usually 4 of them go off to their own friend groups this space is so tiny I dont have a single place to put any of my work because the other students have taken over every space available the work i do have in uni is currently on the floor with shoe prints on them from the other students because the floor was the only free space I could find. We were all given boards in the first week but my tutor just didn't give me one I've asked him twice about a board and he just says oh just remove another students work which I am not doing because then that student will be in the same predicament I was in.\n\nMy parents have even offered to email my tutor because even they can see how ill I've become but I'm 22 and I dont want anyone thinking that I'm immature and have to have my parents call or email in but I can't bring my self to do it I know if I meet him if he bothers to reply to any email and offers to have a sit down with me face to face I'm just going to burst out crying in front of him which I dont want to do because I will feel embarrassed and ashamed.\n\nI even feel like crying right as I write this.\n\nI just feel so down and I don't know what to do I'm back in on Monday to sit down in a class and go over our worshop books so I can then write a long statement about that but ive got 2 pages of work when other students probably have about 20 by now I actually feel afraid just thinking about walking back into uni. \n\nI used to be so happy and enjoyed my work but this is killing me.

I'm new to reddit. I've been perusing through this thread for some time. I'm 24 and recently came to accept I was raised by 2 textbook narcissists. My mother has been out of my life for some time but unfortunately I still live at home w my elderly, very emotionally and mentally abusive father. Due to being raised by 2 abusive parents I naturally have anxiety and depression.\nToday I woke up really late, around 130pm. Today is one of those days where I don't have work so my body tries to catch up on rest. I can feel my anxiety is bad today for some reason. I delayed making dinner as father and I had been snacking and watching movies. When I got up around dinnertime to finally make something he shoved me aside and just grabbed something from the fridge, now drunk. He began to yell and say how I'm so lazy, I never do anything, all I want to do is show my true colors and be a loser nobody just like my mother and lay around all day. When he dies I'm fucked. I might as well become a whore bc im going nowhere in life bc im so lazy. What did he ever do in life to deserve such horrible treatment. Why cant god just grant him the happiness. Why does god hate him. Why is he so cursed. Etc.\nThis is not anywhere near the first time this has been said to me. Honestly this is tame compared to the usual shit he spews at me.\nI'm 24. I don't have a car. After graduating from a 4 yr university w a bachelor's degree and going into a medical technician job I just don't get paid enough to move out on my own. I cant afford rent on my own and I have no friend willing to move in w me (as it's too expensive).\nI do have an option to move south w a friend of mine BUT I only just began a job I really like and it has benefits including insurance and 401k I don't really want to just up and leave it. I have no money saved up as my previous job only paid me 9.25 an hour and I have my own Bill's as well as helping my father w his. I was also briefly unemployed from the transition between the 9.25 job and this new one.\nI just don't know what to do. His behavior towards me constantly is beginning to worsen my depression. I am starting to have suicidal thoughts a lot more. I've tried talking to him about anxiety and depression and he believes it's all fake. It's an excuse to be lazy. It's all in my head. It's how I want to be. It's a myth, etc. Hes a 64 yr old Mexican man, in our culture mental health care is not a thing.\nI just don't know what to do anymore. But it feels good to rant to a bunch of strangers.\nIf you read this far, thank you.

The upper levels of this city were filled with buildings that reached far above the clouds, so much that they said the sky was filled more with glass than moisture, thoughthat doesn't stop them from erecting more towers to appease the corporations that were viewed as omnipotent by everyone else, and not in a good way....greedy bastards.*\n\n*My corner in the world however, the one that would take me anyway, was the lower levels filled with everything that ranged from desirable to undesirable, and that's just the people I'm talking about. Sex, money, drugs and power, sure they're all readily available in the upper levels but those boring shits love to keep it all hush hush to not seem uncivilised so it wouldn't be for me. The lower levels are \"flexible\", to put it mildly, when it comes to all of the elements of our little dystopia but who am I to argue when they're actually honest about it. *\n\n*I sat down in my usual spot in the nightclub, on the middle floor that overlooked the multiple platforms for the dancers to show what they had in store for the people who just wanted to watch but couldn't have. Some were men, some were women, some were a little bit of both but all of them caught my eye while I downed my drink and checked my account to see the credits flow from my previous extraction job, not that you'll know what means unless I tell you. I glanced around to look for anybody else, either on the dance floor or the bar who'd be up to partake in some late night fun. Maybe you were just hiding in plain sight or maybe you had yet to come but I knew I wasn't leaving this club alone tonight*\n\nHey there! Sorry if that was a long read but hopefully you'll be interested in what I've got to offer. This is basically a cyberpunk styled rp, one that involves us in a nightclub in the lower level of the city. It can go a lot of different ways but it all leads to smut, which is the focus of this rp. Obviously I wouldn't mind if there was some build on up but this is still a kinky and dirty roleplay at the end of the day \ud83d\ude09\n\nJust to give you a little bit of info on myself, my names Josh and I'm 20 years old. I'm usually a dom but I can sub if that's preferred.\n\nKinks wise I'm generally limitless aside from a few obvious ones like scat, rape, piss, gore, vore, vomit and torture.\n\nMy kinks include: I have a pretty big foot fetish (your feet by the way), milfs, nerds, goths or emos, big tits, busty figures, femdom, furries, anthros, sluts, threesomes, rough sex, cum stuffing, light bondage, outdoors, oral, ass play, flexibility, excessive cum, teasing, details, flirting\/dirty talk, kissing, licking, biting, scratching, hair pulling, race play, wet sex, showers, confidence, romance, oil play, clothing and long srps. My main kinks would be the foot fetish, flirting, kissing, teasing and flexibility.\n\nI really hope you're interested. If so then DM me on here and we can discuss this. If you have any further questions then please don't hesitate to ask when you message me. If you have any suggestions or ideas for the roleplay then I'd love to hear them! I'd really like this to turn into something long term if I find the right partner so maybe that'll be you \ud83d\ude09 or you're just really horny and wanna have some smutty fun haha. Either one is cool with me \ud83d\ude1c\n\nThanks!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dirtypenpals","subreddit_subscribers":243199,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M4F] [A Dirty Night In The Neon Landscape Of Cyberpunk]","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtypenpals\/comments\/e46tu2\/m4f_a_dirty_night_in_the_neon_landscape_of\/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}

So, tell me what you think.\n\nWhile water spat on his heels, Ebann sat sorry. Funny, he thought, how regret replaces resolution. But he waited all the same, his thumb beating the arm of his throne. Well, a chair. Any chair he sat in was technically a throne. Any bag he threw on his head was a crown, too. A smile, however snide and shallow, emerged upon him for the first time in weeks, but it died at the knock of adoor. Without wait, a messenger, whose age alarmed the King, stumbled in, and then hopped to dispel his anxiety.\n\n\"I, uh\u2026. The boy swings.\" He composed himself to folding his hands and eyeing the floor, and then took awhile to actually consider the weight of his message. Ebann's head also dropped a bit, before he leant back to fetch a bottle.\n\n\"Have a drink, boy. Have a seat.\" This messenger, as his King expected, became engulfed in a harsher second wave of fear. \"Tell me, my boy, if you were king, which anyone can be nowadays, would you have swinged that royal boy like I?\"\n\n\"Well, uh, sure, King! Can't let no more of them royals be!\"\n\n\"Honestly, now boy, thoughtful.\"\n\n\"Uh. He got rot-blood, and them nobles would use a little kid, wouldn't they?\"\n\nEbann's eyes stirred in his head, while his hands sifted through a plentiful black beard for answers. \"But they told me they'd let me stay king, that House Ivelan could be demoted for ceremony.\"\n\n\"They would say, aye King, until they can get a war going.\"\n\nThe King poured the drinks and served them. About to sip his, he recoiled with a silent chuckle. \"Do your parents tell you that, my son?\"\n\n\"Uh, no, they're dead. Dad got an arrow at Sasterne, and mother got thrown two weeks ago 'cause of her knees.\"\n\nIt fascinated Ebann how easy a story this was to tell. Moments ago the boy had stuttered so bad it rang in his ears, now he spoke quicker than a bard. \"Sorry, my boy. I watched my father get crushed by coal.\"\n\n\"Manlier work than war, I say.\" Another chuckle recoiled the King's head, though this time an approving humph came with it. This wasn't anything unusual; Ebann had always found solace in the common uneducated. The peasantry, as it was no longer ok to call them.\n\n\"I'm told land has been spotted further up the fleet, and big swathes of green land, not like that frosty little island.\"\n\n\"If there were a big army o' weird folk on that island, there gotta be some people there too.\"\n\n\"We couldn't expect that one, boy, they caught us like they never can again.\"\n\n\"I knew a lot of people died there,\" he said, still in total apathy. \"But we didn't stop, we still coulda never found land again.\"\n\nQuietness embraced the room, and Ebann's eyes stared sheepishly at the green-tinted water in his glass. \"We could all die on landing. Nearly happened last time. Last two times we were on dry land, they decimated us.\"\n\n\"My Scrier said it's the gods from the Old World.\"\n\n\"Even at the island?\"\n\n\"In the War of Banishment, all of 'em. On the boats, Dundaegen, 'cause the sea. He reckoned the island was the last slash Pascutan took to Avsarr.\"\n\nThe King rose with swiftness and mightiness. \"Better Scrier than Abgen,\" he joked, in theory, not tone. \"I'm about done with hanging potential claimants. We'll prepare a military landing, soon, 150,000 men this time. I'm not gonna get this wrong again. You go tell 'em all that, those noble fucks, 'cause I'm tired arguing.\" He marched slowly around a bit, and the boy, quicker to the door. \"Wait,\" he said, and was instantly obeyed. \"Tell that tall bastard, Ushic, he can see me.

I graduated in 2004 when I was still 18 and in the fall of 2004, my first year of college, that's when I was buying a pack a day everyday and not just smoking here and there. I still remember coming home from college and my mom be like why are you smelling like cigs and I wouldn't admit it even though I was of legal age. That didn't last long as when you become an everyday smoker, its hard to hide. So about up to 4 years ago, I started smoking Vuse Vape. I thought well that's better than smoking and started off and on smoking vape but still smoking cigs but not as much. About two years ago, I started buying the e cig like I would a pack of cigs, everyday. Or at least every other day. I might not buy both at the same time but its one or the other almost everyday. I don't know how much cigs and vape I do as its hard to count the vapes on Vuse, unless you do count yourself. Cigs, I usually smoke a pack in two or three days depending on if its a weekday or weekend. I smoke regular more at work on the weekdays, and vape a lot more on the weekends because at home, its so easy to chill and Vape. So I really want to quit, never really tried but I know its gonna take more than the patch and the gum lol. I have a addicted personality and quit most stuff except cigs and pot. I try to smoke before bed so not a heavy pot smoker but I do smoke at night every night. Its the cigs and the Vape I just want to stop. I'm 34 now and its def. no longer cool or fun. Its totally just addiction with no value other than sucking money and my health from me. The vape did help but to me, I felt like I was smoking all the time. Now I have a small ass device that I can carry everywhere and I can smoke on plans, malls, or wherever I can get away with it. It looks like I have a fist to my mouth and try to not let the smoke go up where people will notice. Anyway, I feel like its got out of control and I know vape is better but I don't think its better when you vape almost every 5 mins or more. I wake up and the first thing I do is vape because its right there. If it was a cig, I would usually just have one before work, not vapping continually every 5 mins before work.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stopsmoking","subreddit_id":"t5_2rbuf","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/stopsmoking","subreddit_subscribers":104302,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Double the trouble","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/stopsmoking\/comments\/e477n7\/double_the_trouble\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I'm generally pretty open minded and easy to get along with for the most part so anyone is welcomed to message me if they want no matter age, sex or where you are from but I will say if you are trying to role play or you are looking for something meaningful, please keep in mind that I am a top and I do prefer the more feminine type.\n\nA little about me in case you may be curious: I'm 24, male, originally from Oregon but I'm kinda far away from home at the moment due to work, I like to read, write and game in my free time when I'm not working or working out, and I'm pretty open minded for the most part. A small description of me though if you want to get to know me more, feel free to message me.\n\nI think that's all I have for now.

Sit back on the mountain of pillow of layed behind me and slowly rub my finger along my bright pink little slit.\n\nAs I start getting wet I use my wetness and slide my fingertip across my little asshole that's barley bigger then the size of a needle hole. I groan as I trace my hole and slowly prod it. Then the door suddenly opens and a worker at the hotel walks in not realizing I'm in here, but I can't here I'm too busy as I pleasure my holes. \n\nBut as soon as you come around the corner to hearing moans we both get shoked to see each other from what's happening. \" oh fuck\" I yell in a panic and cover my self with a pillow. My face burns red with blush. \n\nThat's where we could start from. I want this one to be con. And same character requirements.\n\nPrompt 3 just a normal day at school \n\nThis prompt is inspired by a scene I played with a great person that turned out amazing. \n\nI wake up in the morning after my 18th birthday party. I'm a little hangover as I wake up at 8am. \n\nI slowly turn to my alarm that's dimly lit from lack of power, I read the fuzzy looking numbers \" eii...eight....oh fuck it's eight\" I say to myself as I quickly jump and have a rushed 2 minute shower. I put my small little plaid skirt on, and grey crop top, then I slip my thigh socks on, forgetting my panties and bra.  http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/IJmsd9T\n\nI put some light pink lip stick on, and tie my hair into two piggy tails. As I walk out the house the bus goes pass. \" oh fuck me\" I growl to myself as I start walking down the long road that leads to my school. It's about a 40 minute walk, or 10-15 minute drive. \n\nAs I'm walking I hear a car behind me and frantically wave out. I see the car start to pull over next to me. \" omg sir, can I please get a ride to my school down this way?\" I ask as I fiddle with my hair. \n\nWith this prompt I want to be a little bit sluttier then the other ones. Maybe for a ride to school I need to give you a blowjob. Once at school maybe I need to give my teacher a blowie under the table as he teaches class. And so, of other we can make. \n\n______________________________________________________\n\n My kinks are age play, anal, deep anal, painal, rough sex, taking virginity(ass), large cocks(I like unrealistic), buldges and distenstion, facial, public, creampie, preg risk, and size difference, size play, large cum loads, body writing, tied up, me being flexible (splits and other stuff) and other stuff I would love to discuss with you.\n\nLimits are scat, piss.\n\nI may not get to everyone but be patient and I'll at least send a message saying why.

I'm so tired of being at home day in, day out, doing nothing but laying in bed screwing around on my laptop, studying math to take the GED, and watching TV. Literally 24\/7. Wash, rinse, and repeat unless I'm blessed enough to get to tag along when my parents go grocery shopping. It's been like this since I became home schooled at 12, almost eight years ago now, and I'm just fed up. It would be an honor and a privilege to work in retail\/fast food just so I have the luxury of getting out of the house. nDad thinks I can't get a job without a GED and I don't have a lot of confidence I'll get hired either. I'm 20 with no GED, any type of work or volunteer experience, no car, etc. I'm like bottom of the barrel in terms of what's employable but I just want to try. Even a part time job to acclimate myself to actually leaving the house would still leave me with plenty of time to study for the GED too. \n\nIn any case, I just don't know how much longer I can take it. I'm miserable. I never go anywhere. I never do anything. I never have money to spend on myself. I'm bored. The days and months blur together.\n\nBut of course it's not up to me. In order to keep the peace so I don't have to deal with yelling and threats and manipulation and passive aggression, I have to go along with what my parents want. Neither one will let me try to get a job right now because it's winter and they don't want me walking to work in the cold. Which is the absolute biggest mindfuck I've ever heard because whether I get a job now or in June, I will be walking because I don't have a license or a car. I guess they're gonna expect me to quit my job come October, idk. To be honest I don't care about the cold. I can only apply to places so far from my house because, as mentioned, I have to walk. I'm not immunocompromised and won't develop pneumonia from walking in the rain\/snow for fifteen minutes, contrary to their beliefs. It gets cold here, yes, but it doesn't drop below zero very often and in any case, I'm confident I can deal with it. I have a warm coat and hat and gloves and boots. It's really not even in my top five reservations about applying. \n\nBut I kind of HAVE to have one of them on my side because I don't have a bank account nor do I have any idea how to open one. I've tried reading online but there really aren't definitive answers. But wait, there's more - nDad is definitely gonna want me to use his bank. I watched my brother go through this, he gets pissy if you want to use a different bank. But his bank is far enough away I would have to ride with him and I absolutely do not, under any circumstances, want to have to rely on him to go to the bank. He despises driving me anywhere now, I want to be able to get there on my own. And there is a bank right up the street from me, so it wouldn't be an issue - except circling back to nDad of course. I can honestly say it's nothing against him here except I just want the independence of being able to get to the bank on my own but he won't understand that.\n\nThen there's also the fact that as much as I want to work, I'm also terrified. I have pretty serious social anxiety, ya know since I've had no contact with anybody but my family for almost a decade. So without any support or approval, it's really easy to keep telling myself I can keep waiting.\n\nI'm really about to have a full on anxiety attack typing this. Like there are tears in my eyes and my chest is tightening and everything. I'm just so overwhelmed and clueless and unhappy. I can't do anything for myself because I'm clueless and no amount of reading online will make up for lack of a parental figure.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_subscribers":552842,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I want to get a job.

I'm a 23 year old guy, been riding motorcycles for a few years now. First bike was a 920 Virago, then a classic 1970 CL350 Honda for a while, then a V45 Honda Magna, now I am on a 2007 Sportster 1200 Custom which I love and have had for a year now. Slowly over the past few months, I have had pain that starts in my prostate area and travels to my urethra. It used to be a very slight pain that I only noticed when I was done riding, and now it sets in after only 30 minutes on the bike and is extremely painful, especially when parking and hopping off the seat. \n\nI have tried all different seats without much relief. Right now I'm running with a Mustang vintage wide solo seat as I heard this was pretty much one of the best seats for a Sportster, and I also have a Wild Ass air cushion on top of it, still does not help. Other seats I've tried have been a Mustang regal duke 2 up seat, Sundowner touring 2 up seat, a Saddlemen gel seat, and of course the stock seat.\n\nNow, I have been to the urologist and got checked out. Also had a prostate exam. Walked out with a clean bill of health. I do seem to have a bit of pelvic tension here lately which I've been managing with yoga and trips to the chiropractor. I am unsure whether the bike is responsible for this or not.\n\nI am at a loss as to what to do. I rode the bike all over the place and took it on several road trips when I first got it without any pain or problems whatsoever. I can't understand why after all these miles it would just now be bothering me. Now I do have forward controls on the bike as I'm 5' 10\" and they're more comfortable on my legs. I started thinking maybe the forwards actually make me stretch out too much and thus subject me to more pressure. However I have test rode bikes with mid controls and I still have the pain :(\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the advice so far. I am going to try to find a reputable pelvic floor physiotherapist and see if they can help me, and I also am going to get another opinion from a different urologist. I really, really hope they can help me get this under control. I love riding, it does miracles for my mental health and is a huge hobby for me.

Haven\u2019t yet told him I chose to quit, but I think he probably can tell. \n\nTalk about inspiration.

I first experienced this pain in the last week of October this year. I was jogging at that time and trying to finish 6km (I normally run about 5km, but since we didn't have classes back then I thought to increase my training). I experienced a small pain at my left knee at about 3km, but I just ignored it. I finished my 6km jog with increased pain in my left knee but it was just a little. In the afternoon on that day, I was really noticing the pain and wasn't able to walk and climb the stairs properly. I thought that it'll heal on its own so I left it at that. The pain disappeared after waiting for 2 weeks so I tried to do jumping squats. I felt a small sharp pain on my left knee so I stopped immediately. Two weeks passed again and we had to sprint 40km for our physical education class. Feeling really excited to sprint, I thought that my left knee must be already healed because I didn't do anything to my legs except walking. I felt the pain when we were going back to our classroom climbing the stairs. I didn't do anything later and just waited for it to heal on its own but after 5 days my right knee experienced the same pain just by sitting too long inside the car. I was thinking of consulting a doctor but our financial situation won't allow me. I live in a third world country and money is a hard thing to get.
