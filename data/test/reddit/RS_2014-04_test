For brevity, I'm going to give you a few short background details, then break down the finances. I'm 25 going on 26, and due after spending most of 2012 and 2013 dealing with some crazy medical bills, I've been able to really get things back on track in 2014. I've always done my best to save, and generally be frugal, however I did rack up a bit of debt due to the medical issues mentioned above. Long story short I've got a chronic issue and one of the biggest hits to my budget is medical bills. It's much better than last year (by hundreds a month minimum), but I'd still appreciate some feedback/advice on how to better save/proceed.\n\nSome Important Facts: \n\n* I am still on my Dad's insurance until the end of April, however, the Insurance Company said there's a simple form to fill out and have that extended until the end of the year. I'll believe it when I see it. If that doesn't work out, I'll be most likely be paying like $200/mo for insurance.\n\n* There's nothing I can do to change the medical expenses listed below. I already take generic meds when I can, and the short version is that particular category of expense is non-negotiable.\n\n* My car is paid off in full, and it's got relatively low miles &amp; is basically problem free\n\n* My only debt is the credit cards listed below.\n\nHere's where things stand now:\n\n* Take Home Pay (after taxes): $32k annual salary\n\n* Debt: ~$5,300 credit card debt - about $4k on a card with 12% interest, the rest on a card with 14% interest.\n\n* Cost of Living: $550/mo rent &amp; car insurance\n\nMisc Bills: \n\n* $300/mo on groceries (my boyfriend &amp; I rent from my Dad, and there were a few tough situations in the past few months where I basically stepped up for the greater good, so this should be dropping by about 1/2)\n\n* ~$150/month for Dining/Entertainment - I pay for Hulu for the household ($8/mo), and I try to keep the dining/going out expenses under $150 for the month. I work a lot and also do a lot of the cooking/household tasks, so I like to go out every couple of weeks. Once it's warmed up and there's more free stuff to do - hiking, going to the beach, etc. this amount will likely drop somewhat. \n\n* $100/mo cell phone (I've got Verizon b/c it's the only cell service that works reliably in my neighborhood and home, and I do sometimes use my phone for work)\n\n* Medical Related Expenses: $300/mo consistently. This can fluctuate ~$50-200/mo depending. I've got some chronic issues and basically trying to work all that out has caused me some grief, budget-wise. Currently, the estimate of $300 has been pretty spot on, but since there is the potential to fluctuate, I wanted to include that in there.\n\n* Gas/Car: I spend less than $100/mo on gas because my commute is like 5 miles round trip, and I do a $30 oil change every 3 months (plus any maintenance stuff like tires, fluid, etc. that may come up throughout the year, of course). \n\nSavings \"Plan\":\n\n* $320/paycheck ($160/week) goes into my main Capitol One 360 (formerly ING Direct) Savings Account with interest of .75%. Currently, I've got ~$8,500 saved there.\n\n* $60/paycheck ($30/week) goes into my secondary savings account - same type of account as above. I've got ~$150 in there, and every time it's been hitting $500, I've been making an extra card payment with it. Also, if I have some unexpected medical bills, I will usually pull some money out of here if I've got more than a few hundred, and just do an extra payment or something.\n\nI usually try to make credit card payments every paycheck - I've had a lot of fluctuation over the past few years with unexpected bills for a variety of reasons - medical issues, school tuition (finished my BA so that's out of the way), and helping out family (nothing too nuts - just throwing in more to help out when need be), but for the most part, things seem to be evening out now. I think I've covered everything above in terms of bills &amp; expenses, and if I am missing something, I apologize. \n\nSo, here's where I am at, Reddit. I'd like to do a few things. Firstly, my main savings goal is to be able to afford a house. Without giving too much info away, I live on Long Island, and I love my job, so currently, moving is not an option. I'd like to try to save more, and of course pay down my credit cards. My other goal/concern is retirement - I work for a small business, and do not have any sort of retirement plan set up. Although it's possible there might be one available in the future, it's definitely not now. I love my job, I'm compensated fairly, and although this is a minus, enjoying what I do and the flexibility of the environment I work in is important to me. I'm not even really sure where to begin in terms of retirement, but I know this is something I should be doing. \n\nImportant Info About Future Plans: I am in a long term relationship, and my SO is currently going through the motions to join NYPD. He's like a step away from the Academy, and basically the plan is to get married once he goes through all of the training and begins his police career. He currently makes ~$26k a year before taxes (his bills &amp; salary are not factored into the numbers, etc above), and I just had him set up a 401k - his employer matches 100% up to 3%, and 50% for the next 2%, so he's currently contributing 5%, since free money is free money. Once he's started with the police, I'm going to be managing the finances since frankly I am better at it. I know I am turning to you guys for advice now, but that's just because I need help managing the bigger picture...I have managed to help him get his bills in check, and save about 3 grand over the past 1.5 years (been together for ~2.5), so I think we're on the right track. The pay jump is going to be pretty significant when he starts his career - $35k/annual for training (he told me that's about 6 months), and then $52k starting pay once he graduates and is officially a police officer. I plan on trying to make sure we basically save all of his check that is not already accounted for with bills (not outlined here), for the down payment for a house/condo. The only exception to that would be the retirement plan matching.  \n\nOne more big question: If we're getting married - do we need to have separate retirement accounts still? I know you're all going to say something along the lines of \"don't count your eggs\" since we're not yet married, but let's just assume for a moment we'll definitely be proceeding with this plan. \n\nSorry for the wall of text - I just wanted to explain everything, and I feel like a dummy so I posted this for Moronic Monday. It actually started as a comment and got a bit nuts. This turned into a lot more than I was expecting when I started typing, and I appreciate you taking the time to read this and respond.\n\nTL;DR: Looking to pay off debt faster, save more so I can purchase home, and save enough so that I don't have to work 'til I am 100.

I have been riding for just short of 10 years, and had a street-going sportbike the entire time; I've had bouts with stuntbikes on a few occasions, a supermoto, a dualsport, and some scooters as well. I would estimate that I've probably accrued maybe 50k miles during my time of riding, so not a newb but not the most ridden in the world. At this time I ride a 2012 ZX6, and I find as far as sportbikes go it is perfect for me, fast enough and not as ludicrous and likely to kill me as my ZX10 was.\n\nAnyway, over the last year or so (maybe a little longer) I've found my interest in riding my sportbike to be waning; I only did about 4000 miles the whole year. I think I still enjoy riding, but seeing the same roads I've seen a million times is losing it's appeal, and my self-preservation instincts have kicked in a lot harder. I'm not near as apt to run 100+ mph or do wheelies all over the place like I used to. In fact, the most memorable experience I've had on my sportbike in the past year was my 1400 mile round trip to Indy for the motogp round. All of this is making me wonder if it's time for me to move on from a sportbike. I enjoyed the trip, and I generally like exploring, but I don't have a lot of time or money to go on regular trips... is an adventure bike right for me? The most fun I've had in the last year has been exploring on my dual sport. I think I'm also afraid of losing the nimbleness and ready power of the sportbike... should I just keep the Kawi and see if my heart comes back around to it? I'm just really torn, and I don't want to just not ride while my bike loses value and collects dust, so I don't know what to do.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? I'm 26 if this matters, so still well in the sportbike demographic and not ready at all to go for a \"cruiser\" style bike. I guess another point to make to be fair is that I did lose my job not long after getting the ZX6, and although it's paid for, I'm now back in school and don't quite have as much money to put towards it as I once did (ie- tires, gas, tickets/lawyers if needed, trackdays)\n\nEdit- A few things I have considered in no particular order: VFR800 VTEC, VStrom, Ninja 1000 or 650","media":null,"ups":6,"retrieved_on":1441600075,"created_utc":"1396311106","author_flair_text":"2012 ZX-6R, 2007 KLX250S","media_embed":{},"subreddit":"motorcycles","domain":"self.motorcycles","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"Tiring of sportbikes, any recommendations?","secure_media_embed":{}}

Before my noFap, we'd have once a week. Despite the lack in frequency of our sex, I think our sex life is good- we both enjoy it and it brings intimacy and closeness. Prior to noFap, my body was in a comfort zone where I strongly desired sex once a week and could \"stave\" this off by fapping in-between sex. \n\nThe last couple of weeks of noFap, I've found myself horny a lot more frequently. My wife now has a much weaker sex drive than myself. We both work busy schedules, so I've tried my best to set the mood more frequently but am ultimately frustrated. \n\nAnyone else experience something like this? If so, did it get better?

I'm an INFP. I guess, that's not important, never really has been. Sure I have enjoyed the idea of people like me, and I've read millions of interesting things that I relate to.\nI've always associated myself with the grittier, grunge lifestyle popular in the 1990's. I write poems, and lyrics. My life is full of angst. I'm 17. I feel like I am a soul meant for Generation X, but I was plopped into Generation Y, or Generation Z. Or whatever the fuck Generation the year 1996 decides to be a part of. But I feel I was plopped in this generation as a sick joke. Technology, I do enjoy it. It fascinates me. But even the most mundane objects keep me wondering and intrigued.\nEveryday, I live day to day, clouded by a shadow of melancholy. Putting on a masked smile, made of misery. I hate myself. I'm ashamed to be human. I'm anti-religion in the idea that I don't practice or care because it kills. I've always been fascinated with the number 27 (useless fact unless you search deeper). My role-model? Nirvana Frontman, Kurt Cobain.\nI've been compared to him by close friends who know me well. I guess it's because he was a fellow INFP, or at least resembled one. I see his lyrics as a wave of different tones. They could be serious and profound, but many are not. I am the same way in my poems.\nRecently, I've battled with Clinical Depression and Manic Depression, or Bipolar. I've had asthma, but it's pretty much gone. I have ADHD, I guess... According to doctors for the past oh, i'd say 12 years. For the past 3 years of highschool, Freshman to Junior, I've let my academics slip. I lost the will and the care. Last year, me and a friend were going to sell our ADHD pills, make some money, ya know. Stupid shit you think of as kids. Parents found out before I could sell my first pill. Thankfully. But since then my relationship with my dad and step-mom has been strained. And it's descended into a personal hell.\nRecently, my poems and lyrics got dark. One ended with the sound of a gunshot. I don't know I'm in a different world when I write. I've never gotten close to committing. Ya know, suicide and all. Messy. Broken hearts. But recently, a reason not to do it, has been that my words would get twisted and distorted as would my reason.\nLife fucking blows, sure there is good but overall what's the point when you have no will to continue? My language has grown constantly vulgar.\nI've kept a journal recently. Such entrees include a persona of me, called Jesus Fish, where I am in a sea of fish, that vary in size, type, color, looks, and what not. But they are all just \"fish\". And as the Jesus version of fish, rather than dying for their sins, I am dying so they can all be happy. Not that my death brings joy, but in a way that I hurt myself and slowly kill myself so others can be happy. You know giving up love and shit.\nToday has been a hell hole. Basically being called a leech and worthless by your parents. I know I've thrown my life away but really? Maybe I'm just a whiny little bitch. Eh, can't really discuss much without appearing that way. So, yeah, I am. Anyways, my parents are in the house, in the living room as I sit at this table in the dining room. They don't know this but I've messaged friends, and I told them that... Well, for once I'm ready to actually kill myself. I just, It's finally a fucking option. An obvious one. It's now a fucking answer, ya know?\nThis isn't my suicide note, or a letter to be found. No, I'm still alive, and I will be tomorrow. Unless I die in my sleep.\nI wrote this earlier though, \"I died as I lived, and I will live forever as something I wasn't. I'm not a martyr, I was simple.\"\nI died miserable, I lived miserable. Yeah heavy shit I guess, but I've seen worse.\nMy name is Christian J. Flesner. I'm a teenager with suicidal thoughts. I'm not seeking help, I'm not seeking attention.

I know some of the members asked about who I was so here is an introduction about me. \n\nAs a few of you already know, my name is Lester. I am 24 years old, my ethnic background is Filipino. I play on the PS4 version of Call of Duty Ghost. I started playing COD in college and since then I haven't been able to stop. My Gamer tag is LxB_Cookie. My stats are not great but not too bad; KD 1.83 and W/L 1.2. I usually put in about 3-5 hours of gaming during my off days from work. I work three days a week, 36 hours per week.\n\nOutside of playing Call of Duty, I work in a career as a Registered Nurse. I take care of critically ill patients in an ICU. I recently graduated from nursing school around June 2013 and I am thinking of getting my Masters Degree so I can teach in the later future. I am also married to my wife for a little over a year now, no kids yet. We are just waiting for her to finish school first before we make anything official. Hobbies are eating, sleeping, playing piano (since I was 5 years old), and chilling with my friends.\n\nI am hoping to continue following the progress of RedditBlack. As I am new to Reddit, I still have a lot to learn about navigating around the site. My future goal is to hopefully join the rBLK clan for the PS4 division, though if it never happens I won't take offense.

This is a throwaway account for the off chance a family member of mine finds my account, though I don't think anyone else in my family uses reddit.\n\nI live with my grandparents and my younger brother. I still see my parents on the weekends, though I don't go over every weekend as my brother does. I generally hate it over there, but he seems to like it there better than at home. My brother is 14 and I am 17. When my grandparents got custody of us in 2003, they started taking us to church, when we were previously only passively religious. I used to be very pious and loved going to church and CCD (Catholic religious education). I was an altar boy and even prayed when I was alone, but I slowly grew out of it, and at some point in 9th grade, I finally admitted to myself that I was an atheist. The more I learned and thought about religion, the more I grew to despise it. When I was in 7th and 8th grade, I had some really bad social anxiety, to the point where I was medicated for it and saw a therapist every week. I became extremely stressed out over going to CCD and it became a fight every single time. I recall at one point when there was such a bad fight that we made the agreement that I didn't have to go the next week if I just went this week. Next week rolls around, the agreement was not honored, and I was taken there. The fight that time got so bad that I was screaming at the top of my lungs that I hate them. My uncle picked me up and verbally beat the shit out of me on the way back. I was called ungrateful and many other things, which I do own up to being at least partially. I was taken (i.e. physically dragged into the car) to talk to the new youth minister, Jacob. I had to come back the next week as well. I was in tears nearly the entire first session, and in the latter, he essentially just told me to \"man up\" and such. From that point onward, I never went back to CCD and only went to church a few more times. I have very often been reminded hence that I need to open my heart to our lord and other such nonsense.\n\nThere have been a few smaller incidents since then, but fast-forward to today. I won't go into too many details, but I have won an award that will allow me to go to Germany for four weeks this summer, three of which I will spend attending a German Gymnasium (high school), and one of which I will spend touring the country and going to sites of historical/cultural significance. It will be 100% free to me, apart from passport photos, a passport, and a ride to the airport. I have read many horror stories on here, and have decided to hide my atheism from my grandparents, but I have never explicitly denied it, I just jumped around it every time it was brought up. There's a bunch of paperwork to fill out, and part of it involves asking my religion. On the form it says \"Religion: \", which I filled in with \"Atheist\" (incidentally, both terms are spelled exactly the same in both English and German). I didn't expect her to see that part, but her eyes apparently jumped right to it. She completely lost it, talking about how she and my grandfather joked about how they suspected it, but never thought I could actually be an atheist. She was crying and looked awful, and brought up how during extremely difficult times with my mother, she would not have made it through without faith. Finally, I said I do believe in God and had the form reprinted with \"Katholisch\" (Catholic) in place of \"Atheist\". I also am probably going to start going to church with her and my grandfather again every Saturday just to keep them happy. I may never reveal my atheism to them, even when I am financially self-sufficient. I just wanted to share this experience of mine. For reference, I live in the northern portion of Maryland. I'll comment if I forgot anything.","retrieved_on":1441600026,"ups":7,"permalink":"/r/atheism/comments/21vnyh/why_i_have_to_start_playing_the_religious_game/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Why I have to start playing the religious game again...","subreddit":"atheism","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1396313333","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.atheism"}

I won't stop, I will not give up. Let's get the party started.*\n\n&gt; So, I've finally gotten some things straight in my life. I've always wanted to work on a project - but I've never had the willpower to do it. So this time I've set myself on a one way trip. This is the only road left for me, and I needed somewhere to drop the contents of my brain every once in a while, so I'm dumping it here.\n\nI feel like this is the most important part of this entire journal. The day where I set everything straight. So, I guess I should introduce myself.\n\nMy name is Michaelwm, and I'm a Canadian High School student from Ontario. I'm 14 years old, just on the verge of 15, and in my freshman year of High School. This is where I hope to make a name for myself, and show the world what I am capable of. First off, I should start with some of my social media links:\n\n* Twitter: [@Michaelwm1](https://twitter.com/Michaelwm1)\n* Reddit: [Michaelwm](http://www.reddit.com/user/Michaelwm/)\n* GitHub: [michaelwm](https://github.com/michaelwm)\n\nI've loved Game Development since I started learning to program in seventh grade. It makes me feel accomplished, and provided me with a product that is not just fun for others, but myself as well. I always dream of being someone, an incredible game developer. I finally want to make that dream true.\n\nThings have been getting in my way. School especially, and High School is finally turning out to be a huge time dump. I'm enrolled in the Pre-IB program, and hope to complete the entire IB diploma, but it seems like this dream may not be possible that way. I've still got a year to decide on that, however.\n\nAlthough it's hard to admit, most of the reasons for my failed success is just procrastination. I want to work, but I always find a way to pull myself away from it. I've begun to take initiative, and have no plans on stopping. I've seen it happen many times to others, and I plan to keep going for the years ahead.\n\nCurrently in my real life, it's been a bit hard getting ready to start this project. Robotics has come in the way of a lot of my school work, causing me to catch up for several days. Although robotics is fun and I plan to stay with it for the entirety of high school, it just so happens to take a lot of time away.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I'm a key member in an FRC robotics team. This was our rookie year, and we participated in 2 regional competition. Although we didn't win any awards or head to the world championships, we did achieve semi-final positions in both competitions, with a top notch bot that ranked #1 in tele-operated points in both competitions.\n\nI don't have time to say everything I want to, especially with so much on my mind, but I'll state what I'll be doing over the next few months.\n\n* Post a journal *(hopefully)* everyday, documenting my progress.\n* Write some helpful tips and tutorials\n* Share opinions on topics I may have encountered that day.\n\nAnyways, I want to start with a game called Chapters. I don't want to give away to much, but I'll give some simple facts:\n\n* It's art style is Paper Mario inspired, being a 3D game, but with assets that make it look 2D or a picture book\n* Because I don't have incredible art skills or musical skills, I will be using pixel art and no music in the beginning\n* For reasons to early to explain, the game will be written in Java.\n\nOk, that's about everything I wanted to say today.

I have hypochondriasis and gad which means I am obsessed with illnesses and the guilt from giving other people illnesses. I already had a huge anxious break down about medical issues last year including HSV1 which I already have. so this is literally the worst thing that could ever happen to me. Naturally I ran to the doctor the instant I was having symptoms she told me it looked fine and I just had a ingrown hair from shaving. She said as usual that I am too worried about diseases and I need to go to therapy but I begged her to run a culture and it came back positive.\n\n I have only been sexually active for about 11 months and very sporadically. I've only had sex about 8 times in my life with 4 people. Since I was a little child I was so excited to have sex and now I basically won't be able to have casual sex in my life anymore which is the one of the only things makes me happy. I am someone who has always been unhappy with my life and the only reason I haven't killed myself is because my parents tell me not to and because I have some small things that I can enjoy that make it all worth it, now those things are being taken away from me. I am running out of incentives to keep going. \n\nI'm in college and I cannot live a lifestyle of a college student any more. The only way I'll be able to have sex ever again is if I get somebody to fall in love with me because nobody is going to take that risk for casual sex. I've never been in a relationship and I'm not interested in dating, I don't fall for someone easily at all and i don't think a guy ever has had feelings for me before. I don't know how to get someone to love me, my personality sucks and my body sucks too. Every guy that has purused me this year rejected me after they got to know me, like 6 people in a row. \n\nEven if I did turn into the kind of person who wanted to date someone then there is no way I would wait for us to be in love before we had sex because nobody does that in this day and age, they would get bored and dump me before they got to the point of love. And If I told them before that, they have no incentive to stick around. \n\nThe most important thing I have to think about right now is who am I supposed to tell and who did I get it from. I've only had sex with one person in the past month or so (with condoms) and nobody for a couple months before that, since the inital outbreak is usually the one you notice and is 1-2 weeks after exposure, that means I got it from my most recent partner and he is the one I should tell right? He is a pretty promiscuous guy so I think the odds are higher that it's from him.\n\nMy mom said it could be from the last guy I had sex with which was about 2.5 months ago, because I didn't use a condom then. She said the virus could of lay dormant for a couple months until now. But the infection is outside of the region that is covered by a condom so I don't think that it makes a difference. If it is possible from a previous guy then I know I'll have to tell everyone I've ever had sex with and they will blame me for exposing them to herpes, and I will feel so horrible I don't think I can go through it without an exit plan afterwards. And if they don't think they gave it to me they will be angry and tell everyone I know at my school. \n\nI have no idea who I'm supposed to call now to do the ethical thing. or who can support me. I tried to talk to my mom but she believes in new age bullshit and said my attitude was causing bad things to happen in my life and the same trite stuff about how I should find a comitted relationship and fall in love or go on the STD dating sites. I don't even want to date anyone and if I did it woud be because I became friends with them in real life and developed a crush on them. \n\nI don't know who to call or what to do. I have no reasons to keep trying any more, I just started a new job and finals are coming up, how will I handle all this. I just want to stay in bed and ive been lying here crying for almost 8 hours.

We caught up for a little bit and afterwards as I was walking home, replaying the conversation in my head, a quote came to me. To give you some background, I'm 24 years old and doing pretty well for myself. I graduated the top college in my state (that's not saying much) with a double major, I have a six figure job and I'm taking your advice, focusing my energy on building and investing in myself through my 20's to hit a nice stride by 28,29,30. Then it begins. She has just turned 30, single, good looking according to beta male standards. \n\nI was sitting on the edge of an aisle in church and as I was walking to grab some water, she saw me and asked if I was leaving. I said no and she said ok we'll talk after church. I decided I wanted to try and just listen instead of talking about me or my ideas. 20 min later, service was over and we sat in the lobby and exchanged \u2018how have you been, I didn\u2019t know you go here\u2019 chit chat. We moved to the Starbucks nearby and we started talking about her and her friends who were also 30 and single. She said it\u2019s hard because there\u2019s just no quality guys out there. Yeah..... I asked what qualities she meant. She stopped to think and did that thing where they try to look at the top of their eye sockets. Like you know when you double click with your mouse and that buffering symbol comes up, and does that spinny thing? I could see that over her head. She said, Sense of Humor, Solid Christian, Great job, Attractive, and Masculine. I said wow, that's a nice rainbow you're on. I mean I didn\u2019t need to ask because I know what all women want even though most of them don\u2019t. The Alpha Male. \n\nI was about to ask how high up she must think she is if she has those expectations, especially with a declining SMV at 30. Instead, I said well conversely, there\u2019s not exactly a ton of amazing girls around here either. She said yes there are. Who are attractive and have a good head on their shoulders? She then tried to list her friends, who by the way are a six out of ten. I thought, maybe she\u2019ll take some advice. I humbly suggested something along the lines of making sure you\u2019re the best version of yourself you can be because you\u2019re going to be in the market competing against girls who are younger than you, with no student loans, and no dead end career path. She didn't take it well. She gave me a condescending smug little smile with raised eye brows through the whole thing like \u2018you should stop now' like I was digging myself deeper. Ironically she\u2019s the one digging herself deeper with every day that passes by; every day a little less desirable. I changed the subject and gave her some encouraging words about the job hunt, gave her a hug and left. \n\nI asked myself WHY. Why do these people fight so hard against the very advice that solves all their lonely nights and crying themselves to sleep? What about increasing your value is sooo atrocious? I mean she has to know that given the choice, any guy would take a hot 22 year old over her. Its like supply and demand doesn't exist to these people; they have God\u2019s iPad and can rearrange market value so there is no uglies or single 30-somethings. No, they're all equal. \n\nThen it hit me: \"The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. **You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.\"**\n\n15 years ago today.

After my dad passed away, he left a sizable amount of money for my inheritance (I can't touch it until I'm 25).\n\nSo because my mom and I have been in our current apartment for about 10/11 years now and paying ~$500/month (rent; not including utilities); if you do the math, well we could have paid a significant down payment already.\n\nMom has a stable job and I (as a college student) am looking for a spring through summer job/internship; as I always have some job/work during my time in college.\n\nI found a couple places near where we currently live (about 10-15 mins away) but they are closer to her work location as well as the school I am transferring to (in the fall).\n\nSo basically growing up, mom always said she wanted to save my inheritance so that I could buy a house but I really don't foresee needing/wanting a full house by the time I'm 25/26. So I thought why not just having us stop paying rent and use the money to buy a townhouse. We could probably buy the place straight up and maybe even get a cash payment or full payment discount of some kind.\n\nI foresee that my mom and I will be in the area a while and even if we aren't I'm sure we could easily find people to rent from us (friends or approved strangers/mutual acquaintances/etc) since this area has a lot of (good) schools, food, shopping, is near the freeway, near the areas wine country.\n\nWhat would be the biggest worries of this happening?

I'm an INFP. I guess, that's not important, never really has been. Sure I have enjoyed the idea of people like me, and I've read millions of interesting things that I relate to. I've always associated myself with the grittier, grunge lifestyle popular in the 1990's. I write poems, and lyrics. My life is full of angst. I'm 17. I feel like I am a soul meant for Generation X, but I was plopped into Generation Y, or Generation Z. Or whatever the fuck Generation the year 1996 decides to be a part of. But I feel I was plopped in this generation as a sick joke. Technology, I do enjoy it. It fascinates me. But even the most mundane objects keep me wondering and intrigued. Everyday, I live day to day, clouded by a shadow of melancholy. Putting on a masked smile, made of misery. I hate myself. I'm ashamed to be human. I'm anti-religion in the idea that I don't practice or care because it kills. I've always been fascinated with the number 27 (useless fact unless you search deeper). My role-model? Nirvana Frontman, Kurt Cobain. I've been compared to him by close friends who know me well. I guess it's because he was a fellow INFP, or at least resembled one. I see his lyrics as a wave of different tones. They could be serious and profound, but many are not. I am the same way in my poems. Recently, I've battled with Clinical Depression and Manic Depression, or Bipolar. I've had asthma, but it's pretty much gone. I have ADHD, I guess... According to doctors for the past oh, i'd say 12 years. For the past 3 years of highschool, Freshman to Junior, I've let my academics slip. I lost the will and the care. Last year, me and a friend were going to sell our ADHD pills, make some money, ya know. Stupid shit you think of as kids. Parents found out before I could sell my first pill. Thankfully. But since then my relationship with my dad and step-mom has been strained. And it's descended into a personal hell. Recently, my poems and lyrics got dark. One ended with the sound of a gunshot. I don't know I'm in a different world when I write. I've never gotten close to committing. Ya know, suicide and all. Messy. Broken hearts. But recently, a reason not to do it, has been that my words would get twisted and distorted as would my reason. Life fucking blows, sure there is good but overall what's the point when you have no will to continue? My language has grown constantly vulgar. I've kept a journal recently. Such entrees include a persona of me, called Jesus Fish, where I am in a sea of fish, that vary in size, type, color, looks, and what not. But they are all just \"fish\". And as the Jesus version of fish, rather than dying for their sins, I am dying so they can all be happy. Not that my death brings joy, but in a way that I hurt myself and slowly kill myself so others can be happy. You know giving up love and shit. Today has been a hell hole. Basically being called a leech and worthless by your parents. I know I've thrown my life away but really? Maybe I'm just a whiny little bitch. Eh, can't really discuss much without appearing that way. So, yeah, I am. Anyways, my parents are in the house, in the living room as I sit at this table in the dining room. They don't know this but I've messaged friends, and I told them that... Well, for once I'm ready to actually kill myself. I just, It's finally a fucking option. An obvious one. It's now a fucking answer, ya know? This isn't my suicide note, or a letter to be found. No, I'm still alive, and I will be tomorrow. Unless I die in my sleep. I wrote this earlier though, \"I died as I lived, and I will live forever as something I wasn't. I'm not a martyr, I was simple.\" I died miserable, I lived miserable. Yeah heavy shit I guess, but I've seen worse. My name is Christian J. Flesner. I'm a teenager with suicidal thoughts. I'm not seeking help, I'm not seeking attention. I want a way out.\n","media":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1441599972,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/depression/comments/21vs40/my_true_story_xpost_from_rinfp/","from":null,"author":"TheFlez","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":0,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_21vs40","link_flair_css_class":null,"id":"21vs40","archived":true,"score":1,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"created":1396319347,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qqqf","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/21vs40/my_true_story_xpost_from_rinfp/","secure_media":null,"stickied":false}
{"selftext":"To You,\n\u200b\nToday I am 29. And \u200bnearly 2 years ago I lost my person.Typically\u200b \u200b\"lost\"insinuates a passing or death- a transformation of one's self and the surrendering of the soul, if you believe in that sort of thing, anyway. In my case, death\u200b \u200bwould have given me more closure than the \"lost\" I actually experienced. On May 15, 2012, our anniversary, you took\u200b \u200bthe keys to our 2012 Acura RDX, packed up\u200b \u200byour\u200b \u200bclothes and left our home. O\u200bur \u200bcity. Our puppy. Our life.\u200b \u200bMe.\u200b \u200bNo reason. Gone.\u200b \u200bVanished like act 4 of a David Copperfield show.\u200b \u200b\n\nSince then I have done my best to pick up the pieces. Scratch that. Since then I have done my best to survive. Finding each day I managed to hold on and breathe, a day I survived.\u200b \u200bIn vain I tried to get you back. Searched for reasoning for our failure. \n\nWe carried on naively attempting to share our dog, be friends, separate our assets, stay amicable. The unceremoniously cliche bullshit every couple thinks they\u200b \u200bcan rise above and\u200b \u200bare mature enough for.\u200b \u200bAs we discovered, we were no different. We screamed.\u200b \u200bWe threatened.\u200b \u200bWe hurt each other as best we could. I blocked\u200b \u200byou\u200b\u200br\u200b phone,\u200b \u200byou\u200b \u200bchanged\u200b \u200byour\u200b \u200bnumber, communication ceased.\n\nI lost weight. Buried myself in work. Controlled the things I could\u200b \u200bcontrol . Walked the dog. Cried. Sought new meaning.\n\nIt was summer now. My favorite time of year. Was my favorite time of year. Memories of a past life haunted my every step. Pricking me as I\u200b \u200bcarried groceries down\u200b \u200bSmallman toward the Strip, where we made our first home together. It followed\u200b \u200bme\u200b \u200bto\u200b \u200bBingham Tavern, faking a smile as the pungent swash of Two-Hearted passed my lips. Left me breathless on docks of Lake Charlevoix where we dreamed up our future under the dewy sheath of the starlit Northern Michigan sky. You were gone and I was dead inside. And when the man with the black stained Levi's and green hoodie drew his knife toward me on the filthy, littered concrete of Sarah Street, I yearned for the relief. For the end of it all.\n\nAfter the mugging, my estranged parents clung to me like a junkie to his dealer. I moved home. Started a new job with one of the top footwear dealers in the world. The job I had been interviewing for when you left. I dated. I laughed more. Traveled. Volunteered. Re-learned what happiness felt like.\u200b\u200b\n\nNearly 9 mo would go by before you would see me again. 3 days before my birthday.\u200b \u200bMarch 28th.\u200b \u200b\"Hello,\" you said as you reached out for that awkward embrace. I stiffened under your arms, shocked,\u200b \u200bshaking. \"Wanna get together sometime?\u200b\" Casually, as if we were friends.\u200b \u200bI couldn't tell you what was said after tha\u200b\u200bt.\u200b \u200bAnother\u200b \u200bawkward attempt for an\u200b \u200bembrace and as quickly as you came, you were gone. Heading for the door, the Seven jeans I bought you 2 Christmases ago dragging at your heals as\u200b \u200bmy knees buckled and I gasped for\u200b \u200bair. I my survived my first\u200b \u200bdrive-by.\u200b\n\u200b\nIt would be a week later\u200b \u200bwhere I would receive the surprise visit from\u200b y\u200bour buddy Kris\u200b \u200bat my office. A message for me. Paperwork. A restraining order. \"Harassment.\" This had to be a joke.\u200b \u200bPrior to the run-in,\u200b \u200bI hadn't spoken to you in months\u200b. \u200bForget that I hadn't a clue\u200b \u200bwhere you lived, or\u200b \u200byour number, or your anything! Forget that you were a stranger to me.\u200b \u200b\"Someone I used to know. \" A ghost of my past whom, only a mere week\u200b \u200bago reared its ugly head at my work-sponsore\u200bd\u200b\u200b\u200b \u200bcharity event for one last haunt. Was I dreaming?\u200b A cruel joke?\u200b\n\nI would go to court in attempt to clear my name.\u200b \u200bApparently only a verbal affidavit is necessary for a judge to approve on a report such as this\u200b \u200bYou had no proof, nor\u200b \u200brhyme or reason to back up your claims\u200b, yet \u200bher\u200be \u200bwe were, me and my council on one side, you and yours on the other, \u200b\u200bin a \"mediation\"\u200b \u200broom looking to reach an\u200b\u200b \"understanding.\" What the fuck?! What's there to understand? I'm not harassing you! I wanted to scream. Was\u200b \u200bwere you doing this to me?? I felt like I was living in an alternate universe.\u200b \u200bThere was\u200b \u200bno substantial evidence to support your claim\u200b\u200b, yet no resolution was made. In the end, your parent's money and hot shot lawyer\u200b \u200b(drinking\u200b \u200bbuddy of Judge LaValle, le honorable\u200b)\u200b\u200b\u200b won the pissing contest. I forewent my option of a further hearing (to save\u200b\u200b \u200bfurther emptying my savings in lawyer fees) to move on continuing as I\u200b \u200bhad, not talking to you.\u200b \u200bWas it wrong for me to fold to your lies? Did it infer guilt? Maybe. I didn't care. I was horror- stricken at what we had become. The memory of the relationship we once had. The relationship I worked so hard to survive...to bandage and mend from, was torn back open, a gaping wound. Who were you? Did I ever really know?\n\nLike clockwork, the text messages started.\n\"Whore.\"\n\"Slut.\"\n\"Bitch.\"\nThey came flooding in from ever area code. Crippling messages of hate. Then the calls. Heavy breathing at 3am or, 18 incoming calls and hang-ups from 2pm-3pm.\u200b \u200bThreats of violence at noon.\u200b \u200bThe first police report. Det. Baldwin\u200b \u200bscratched his head, \"block the numbers,\" he would say. Like that never occurred to me.\u200b \u200bHe was at a loss and I was low man on the totem pole of the police department's \"to-do\" list.\u200b \u200bIt didn't stop. \"The calls are being made from an app\u200b \u200bor online,\" he'd report. \"This internet stuff is t\u200b\u200bricky.\u200b \u200bThey can't be traced,\" Detective Baldwin would inform me.\u200b \u200bThanks. \"To serve and protect,\" isn't that the line?\u200b \u200bThere was a personal protection order out, but who was going to protect me?\n\nEnter, technology. I called my phone carrier and they were able to change the settings on my phone service so that I would only receive incoming calls/texts from those whose numbers were saved in my phone book. That handled that...for the most part, anyways. However, whomever my admirer was\u200b \u200bonly got creative. In the months to follow I had my credit cards compromised twice, Facebook and email accounts hacked, even my original Reddit account hacked and deleted. My iPad was stolen (and oddly found outside my office 3 days later), my dog and my house put up for sale on Craigslist, and car anonymously towed. I filed report after report to the\u200b \u200bpolice. By now I was on a first name basis with many of the officers, knowing many of their shift schedules by heart. Yet, there was nothing. No suspects. No leads. Nothing. I lived in\u200b \u200ba state of constant anxiety, yet my case sat collecting dust. \n\nLike a game of tattle-tale ping-pong,\u200b \u200bmy ex's parent's would (ever so sanctimoniously and embarrassingly )\u200b \u200bcall often on my parent's to accuse me of one thing or another. Posting your phone number (which I never had) and address (which I didn't knew) on the internet. Signing you up for gay porn. Seriously? I couldn't understand. Would I be to blame for everything that went wrong in your life from here on out? My parent's were shocked. When would this end?? Just leave me alone! I wanted to scream it from the mountains. My parent's never got involved, not that I expected them to. My father had an aversion to drama. I felt alone and deeply sad. Like a firefly trapped in a mason jar, my light slowly going out. I had loved these people. How could they ever think I would be capable of hurting anyone? \n\nMy word would shatter many times in the coming months and I would lose more than I ever thought possible.\n\n\"I love you, loser\u200b. See u tomorrow.\"\n\nThis\u200b \u200bwould be the last message I would receive from my best friend Marc.\u200b \u200bThree hours later\u200b \u200b\u200bhe would be killed trying to cross the street by a\u200b \u200byoung woman who \u200b co\u200buldn't wait until her car was stopped to text her friends.\u200b \u200bHe was 29. I lost Becca a month after, 28. She fought hard, but the cancer that had ravaged her body for nearly 6 years had taken its final toll. She was 28. Then me. Stage 1 Melanoma. Those were the results printed out on my lab report after a routine visit to my doctor left me with a biopsy request. \n\n\"Biopsy,\" I asked? \n\n\"We just want to be sure. It's probably nothing.\"\n\nI had smaller margins, which was good and they had caught things early. I had four surgeries total. Sometimes I feel like I'm dating my oncologist, being that he's seen me naked and is the only man I'm seeing regularly. I will most likely be on medication for the rest of my life, but cancer has not yet bested me.\n\nExhausted and\u200b \u200bworn\u200b \u200bdown, I\u200b \u200btried to keep\u200b \u200bon routine. I was killing it at work and shopping for homes on the weekends. I got back into dance and joined a studio. I even met a boy. Luke was fun and exciting and a welcome distraction! Like you, a hockey player...albeit one who gets paid for it, he made me feel alive again.\u200b \u200bAll seemed to be falling into place\u200b. I was starting to feel like me again. Starting to feel like I wasn't broken or cosmic's joke to the universe.\n\nThen it started again. It seemed any device I touched, my phone...my ipad...my computer had an issue. Slowly I noticed new pictures showing up in my photo stream, apps shifting or being added and deleted, and my passwords seemed to be locked or changed every other day. At first I didn't think too much of it, must be a virus (do iphones get viruses?). Nothing exactly serious, just the typical day-to-day annoyances, really. But when I received a call from Paypal requesting I make payment on my -$872.00 balance, I hit the floor. \"What balance,\" I screamed! After rattling off an old address, a user name I had never heard of, and purchases dates that were not mine, \u200bsomething was up\u200b! The \u200bPayPal \u200brepresentative requested the last 4 of my social security (which I begrudgingly divulged) and then to my horror, confirmed the last 4 digits of the bank account they had on file\u200b for the account\u200b. My bank account. Someone had used my information to set up a fraudulent PayPal account! \u200bHack 1. \u200bI canceled everything. I filed a case with my bank, called the credit bureau to flag my account, and contacted Social Security. \u200bI met with my bank to go over every transaction from the past 3 months, that's when I noticed the itunes charges. They were minuscule, nothing that would have ordinarily caught my eye- $1.99 here, $2.99 there. I called Apple Support. Hack 2. Not only had my account been compromised, but whomever hacked it, changed everything! My password, my ID, the email address on file where I received my notifications, even my 2-step verification questions! And since I no longer had any of my original boxes or packaging, all Apple could tell me about my account was the my user ID was on file, but that it had been changed. I lost everything. I had never before felt more violated or exposed. Apple referred me to the police to file a report, which I did however, it wasn't easy. I must have talked to 4 different officers, each one looked at me dumbfounded and more confused than the last. I might as well have been trying to explain what happened in Klingon! Finally a detective agreed to take my case.\n\u200b\nI've had many obstacles in the last 2 years. Experienced and endured more heart break and tragedy than I ever thought possible. Nothing would prepare me for what lied ahead. It was 8am and I was heading out for work, nearly a week after the hacking ...my bank still working through all my accounts. I opened my garage to find what felt like, half the police department pulled up in the drive way. Were there terrorists in my house that I didn't know about? Det. Creswell, after asking for my name, explained to me that he had a warrant to seize my electronic devices. What?? He told me that I was under investigation for harassment and the illegal filing of a police report. Once again, WHAT?? \"I have no idea what you're talking about,\" I told the detective. \"I haven't done anything!\" Without a fight, I handed over my phone, my ipad, and my computer. I had nothing to hide. Two hours passed of interrogation passed. I was emotionally and physically drained. I wanted to throw up. I was belittled, told I was beautiful, and that everyone hated me in an effort to get a confession. But there was nothing for me to confess to! I had done nothing wrong! Another officer came up, he and the detective whispered inaudibly between themselves for a moment before my detective came back. He told me that they were able to find apps on my ipad used to disguise my IP address that matched those used from their investigation. There must have been a mistake, I told the detective!! I never even knew such apps existed, let alone download them myself!!!I had not done any of this! He told me that he would need to take my devices to look into further, but that he would be in touch and that I should expect to be charged. \"Charged!\" I cried! \"For what?\" I hadn't done anything! Not so much as a speeding ticket had ever been on my record, and now I was told to expect to be charged?!!!\n\u200b\nSure enough, the charges came. A warrant for my arrest came through 3 days later, which meant I was now faced with the choice to either a.) show my willingness to cooperate in the investigation process and turn myself in freely on charges I did not commit or, b.) wait for the police to knock my door down or show up at my office to haul me away. \u200bThere are no words to describe the feelings. I sobbed. Why was this happening to me?! When you watch episodes on Dateline or 60 Minutes about people who go to prison and serve time for crimes they didn't commit, you feel terrible, even sick inside at how something like that could ever happen. The injustice. Nothing compares to what it feels like in real life. I was scared. Embarrassed. Anxious. Sad. Every emotion reverberating through me like a surge of electricity.\n\n I had a few friends in the police department who I reached out to. They felt awful and offered to help me out and escort me to the jail. Everything smelled like piss and nobody smiled. The men with their faces up against the glass cat calling and whistling as I walked up to give my finger prints. I spent nearly 5 hours in jail with some of the most despicable individuals I had ever seen. I was charged on 3 felony counts of aggravated harassment, one of which involved filing a report that my Ex was a pedophile and selling child pornography. Each with a possible prison sentence. Because of the good word and my friends from the police department put in for me, along with my non-existent wrap sheet, I was let go on a p/r bond, which basically meant that I was let go on the \"good faith\" that I would not skip town before my court date. I left the jail, got into my car (which was allowed to park in my friend's spot during my stay) and screamed until my lungs could take no more. With tears streaming down my face I turned on the ignition and got the fuck out.\n\u200b\nI was appointed at an attorney by the state. She has bright frizzy copper hair and awkwardly drawn on eye brows. Her clothes are covered in stains and overall, she looks like she just stepped out of a Harry Potter book. But she is to the point, up front, and seemingly honest. She is also all I've got as, the medical bills have eaten through the majority of my savings.\n\nToday I am 29 years old. I am facing a max of 7 years in prison on crimes I did not commit. I walk around like a zombie, numb and unable to process how I came to this spot in my life. How did this happen to me? Will I make it through? The authorities claim I did this to you, yet I would never hurt you. \u200b\u200b\u200bThey claim they have proof I am to blame. Claim there are pictures and apps that incriminate me, yet I have no idea what they are talking about. I'm scared and don't know how I am to defend myself when all I have is word. They say that the hard things in life make us stronger. Well, I don't feel strong. I don't know what to do or who to turn to. I don't trust anyone. I feel scared and alone. Today I am 29 and all I want to do is give up. Maybe I will.\n\n-Me","media":null,"ups":9,"retrieved_on":1441599972,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/SuicideWatch/comments/21vs64/an_open_letter/","thumbnail":"default","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"An Open Letter","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1396315777","subreddit":"SuicideWatch","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.SuicideWatch","edited":1396373458,"score":9,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"created":1396319377,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qpzs","from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/21vs64/an_open_letter/","stickied":false,"from":null,"author":"[deleted]","is_self":true,"num_comments":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_21vs64","id":"21vs64","archived":true}

In the class we all pair off and then the pairs stand in a circle and every 15 minutes or so the ladies all rotate around one so we're always dancing with someone new. There are about 20 guys in the class and they've all been perfectly polite and fun to dance with except for one.\n\nThis guy, Man. At first he danced with me but was an incredibly weak lead. In all of the dances we've done so far we're standing about an arms length apart, one of the mans hands is cupped and placed directly under the lady's armpit on the upper back and the other is holding one of the lady's hands. The hand on the lady's back is the one that leads so it is supposed to be firm and strong. His hand always just kinda lightly sat on my body when we danced. Today, though, when it was my turn to dance with him he legitimately hover-handed me for a few minutes and then just let go of me and said \"I don't know how to do this dance.\" Then the next time the rotation brought us together he didn't even bother trying to hover hand me. He just said, \"I don't know this one. You can go dance with someone else if you want.\" and just stood there. The thing is though, he was dancing perfectly fine with the girl in the rotation before me and he magically remembered the steps as soon as the rotation changed again and he was with the girl after me so I know he's specifically singling me out and does not want to dance with me. Here is a quick rundown of things I know about myself:\n\n* I have good hygiene so I know that I do not smell bad or am not excessively sweaty or something.\n\n* I am not the best dancer but I am by far not the worst.\n\n* I am not rude, standoffish, or otherwise negative to my dance partners.\n\n* I am 6' tall and about 270 lbs. I wear a size 22(US). I've been told that I carry my weight pretty well and I make an effort to dress cute everyday so I know I'm not a hottie with a body but I'm definitely not repulsive to look at.\n\nI've never spoken more than 2 sentences to this guy so I know whatever issue he has with me has to do with my physical appearance and not my personality. I am the only bigger girl in the class and the only one he singles out. This class isn't advanced enough to get into the dance moves where you're picking up your partner and throwing them around so my weight has literally never been an issue when dancing with all of the other guys but I honestly can't think of any other difference between me and the rest of the girls in the class that would make this guy respond to me like this.\n\nI don't know what to do about this. I don't *want* to dance with this guy but having to just awkwardly stand there for 15 minutes every time he comes up in the rotation is putting a damper on the fun of my dance class and also having to be reminded every class that someone thinks that someone finds you so unattractive that they won't even touch you in a lighthearted, completely non-romantic setting isn't exactly doing wonders for my self esteem. \n\nAlso, if I wanted to do something about it I wouldn't even know *what* to do. Part of me wants to just straight up ask him what his problem is in the middle of class. It wouldn't necessarily solve my problem but trying to make him feel/look like an asshole would probably make me feel better about it. Basically the only win I can see myself getting out of this is petty gratification that I embarrassed him in front of the class and wanting that kinda makes me feel like a bad person.\n\nWhat would you ladies do in my dancing shoes?","permalink":"/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/21vs9y/im_pretty_sure_a_guy_in_my_dance_class_is/","link_flair_text":null}

I've been throughly enjoying everyone's stories and wanted to share one of my own.  Although I've always been a very sexual girl I feel that I've become much more comfortable and expressive with my sexuality in the last couple years, some of which I attribute to my wonderful boyfriend.  For context I am 24 and my partner is 32. \n\nA little background on our relationship- it started out pretty casual.  He was in an open relationship and I was planning on moving out of state in less than a year so in the beginning our relationship revolved around sex.  We had a good rapport, and communication flowed freely since there wasn't much to lose, so our sex was super kinky and exploratory.  Eventually he and his girlfriend split up (due to other circumstances), and as time went on we fell in love.  Now we have been together \"officially\" for about three years.  But this story isn't just about us.  When we initially decided to start a committed relationship we were monogamous for a stretch.  This story is about an adventure I had the first time we decided to open our relationship up again.\n\nI had recently started spending time with a new group of people I met through a mutual friend.  One of the guys had a very nice house with a hot tub which he hosted small parties at regularly.  There was an instant attraction between us, and while I appreciated the attention, we kept a respectful distance as I had a boyfriend and I knew the terms of our openness were still unclear.  One night a couple of people came over with some moly and we all enjoyed a few bumps.  My neck was a little sore from work and I was rubbing it.  My friend, we'll call Amir, noticed and began massaging my shoulders.  Later a group of us got in the hot tub to enjoy the stars and a few bottles of wine.  Everyone was feeling good, it was dark and we were tightly packed.  I felt Amir's fingers start to slide over the small of my back squeezing my waist and then making their way up and down my leg.  It felt incredible and I was instantly aroused from the party favors and the sexual tension I had felt building between us over the past month.  \n\nThat was as far as things went that night, but when I went home I confessed my desires to my boyfriend.  He and I talked it over and he gave me permission to pursue things.  A few days later I went out with Amir and our friends again.  As the night was winding down I asked for a ride home from the bar, but on the way I suggested we go for a dip at his place.  When we arrived I told him I was interested and that I had permission to play with him outside of my relationship.  He was astonished at first, couldn't believe his luck the sweet man.  After asking a few questions he was all over me.  Going on about how incredibly sexy I was and how much he had wanted me, saying he wanted to taste every inch of me.  \n\nHe pushed me up against the wall pressing into me and I could feel how aroused he was already.  I could barely contain myself either and soon we were ripping each other's clothes off.  He picked me up in his strong arms and carried me up to his room, throwing me onto the bed and teasing my nipples with his teeth.  His head made it's way down between my legs and he let out the most delicious moan as his tongue entered me and swirled around my clit.  He was worshipping me and I loved the effect I was having on him.  After a few minutes he came up and tried to enter me but I wrapped my legs around him and flipped him onto his back.  As hard as it was I wanted to draw this out a little longer.  It was my turn to play with him.\n\nI took his cock in my mouth slowly, lubing up the head before sliding the entirety of his shaft into my mouth.  As I went to work he moaned and looked at me incredulously.  \"Oh my god you're good at that.  How are you so good at that?  You actually know what you're doing!\"  I should mention here that Armir is in his late 30's, and perhaps because of my age it came as a slight surprise to him the way I was working his cock.  He actually should thank my boyfriend for this although i didn't take the time to tell him so.  My boyfriend has a think 8\" piece and is VERY instructive, which made tackling Armir's lovely, but probably 6\" cock much easier in comparison.  \n\nI teased him for a while, getting him close and then pulling back a bit until he couldn't take it anymore and jumped up forcing me onto my stomach and pulling my legs off the bed so I was bent over it.  He spread my legs apart and played with my pussy while he reached for a condom.  Frustratedly he spanked me a few times (which I LOVE) and finally entered me, pounding away with no mercy.  After all the build up I knew he probably wouldn't last long and began to finger myself as he pulled my hair, gripping my hips and thrusting deeply.  I was right, the sex only lasted maybe five minutes, but by the end of it we had both come hard and collapsed into a sweaty, breathless, laughing pile. \n\nBONUS continued in comments (what happened when I got home).","retrieved_on":1441599945,"ups":52}

Ever since I was 13 I've wanted to be a girl, I grew up happy as a boy on the outside but always remember feeling sad about something and being very sad and angry underneath.. Anyway as I was starting to meet my sexual desires around 13 not very long in I had the thought, what is it like to be her? BOOM! That consumed me for at least a year, but it was just sexual.. I mean did I want everything that goes along with being a woman too? I didn't know, but I remember many nights praying to a god I didn't believe in (sorry for anyone religious, no offense just has never been my thing, more power to you if it is :) ) even making deals with a devil I didn't believe in, hoping hysterically that I would wake up a woman.. Fast forward a little ways, let's say high-school, I successfully hid everything deep down, I was your typical guy, chasing after girls and partying with friends, I played football and was very good, sure I had a few desires pop up here and there, I still found the idea of being with a guy appealing, although I never acted on it as I didn't like the idea that I was a guy too.. Fast forward to 20 years old, I'm looking at some porn and I see something with a Transgender girl in it. BOOM! I can't explain it but the feeling of that's what makes me feel different, that's what has been going on with me. I was meant to be a woman, I looked in to other aspects other than sexual and they all seemed to be what I wanted, that night I was positive, that's what I need to do, I NEED TO BE A WOMAN.. Of course reality set in within a few days and I became totally consumed with weather or not this was right for me, in the meantime, I started sexually fantasizing as the girl again and haven't really stopped, I'm 21 now.. So why not just fucking transition? Well for starters by the time I had this realization, I had found the girl of my dreams, she loves the man that I am more than anything and I love her too, so after a few months I decided to see a gender specialist, who by he way is my hero! She charges over $100 a session and out of the goodness of her heart had multiple sessions with my broke ass for $15.. We sifted through a lot and we decided that there's a damn good chance that I'm Trans, she's even willing to write me a letter for hrt.. But here's the problem, and I'm being very honest in this post so I'm trying not to make the same mistake,I'm a damn good salesman and I've always been able to manipulate things to my favor, not really a good thing I know, but I wonder if I was just selling her on things and I don't even know if everything I said there was true, I truly am a happy person, I will live a good life as a man, and I don't think I would rather die than have to be a man.. So now I'm engaged, idk what I was thinking, I just want to be normal and be with this woman I love so much and I know from our conversations that she is 100% not into women at all, and I would definitely lose her if I transition.. So I just don't know, I mean she truly makes me happy and isn't that what this is all about, being happy? I think I would live a decent life just staying a guy, I think.. But these feelings aren't going away and they are definitely stronger.. Sometimes I think I still listen to what my body is telling me, by that I mean my hands, has anyone ever heard male and female hands? If you're index finger is longer than your ring finger than that's a sign of higher estrogen levels in the womb and very typical of a female and suggests a female type brain.. Looking at my hands they damn sure say I'm not normal and I would have to agree with them..

You called the listed number with a brand-new cell phone, (To be thrown away afterwards) and quietly placed your order. The price was nothing to scoff at, but you knew it would all be worth it.\n\n\nThe remote was the first thing to arrive. A small, nondescript black device, about the size of a deck of cards. The touchscreen lights up and you notice a few different options on the menu. First is a button that, when pressed, sends my arousal skyrocketing, making me willing to do anything to cum.\nAnother is my \"Reward\" button, which makes me suddenly experience a mind-blowing orgasm that leaves my body trembling and my pussy dripping. (With an extra option to make the orgasm purely mental, making me writhe in pure bliss, but my body doesn't experience actually cumming.\n\n\nFinally, there is a \"Punishment\" button that wracks my body with a sharp, very painful shock. The manual recommends other methods of behavior correction, but mentions that it can be quite effective as punishment.\nThe other buttons? Well.... They're up to you.

How are you dressed? How am I delivered? Am I in a crate? Kneeling at the door, wrapped in ribbon and a collar? Am I standing in a flowy sundress and flip-flops?\nWhat did you order? After all, you described exactly what you wanted when you ordered me. Did you want a blonde, bubbly, bimbo? A sensual, slender, slut ? A perky, playful, puppy? Something without so much alliteration?\nI'm always looking for RP partners. Any comments below telling me to PM/kik you will be promptly ignored.

I'm an INFP. I guess, that's not important, never really has been. Sure I have enjoyed the idea of people like me, and I've read millions of interesting things that I relate to. I've always associated myself with the grittier, grunge lifestyle popular in the 1990's. I write poems, and lyrics. My life is full of angst. I'm 17. I feel like I am a soul meant for Generation X, but I was plopped into Generation Y, or Generation Z. Or whatever the fuck Generation the year 1996 decides to be a part of. But I feel I was plopped in this generation as a sick joke. Technology, I do enjoy it. It fascinates me. But even the most mundane objects keep me wondering and intrigued. Everyday, I live day to day, clouded by a shadow of melancholy. Putting on a masked smile, made of misery. I hate myself. I'm ashamed to be human. I'm anti-religion in the idea that I don't practice or care because it kills. I've always been fascinated with the number 27 (useless fact unless you search deeper). My role-model? Nirvana Frontman, Kurt Cobain. I've been compared to him by close friends who know me well. I guess it's because he was a fellow INFP, or at least resembled one. I see his lyrics as a wave of different tones. They could be serious and profound, but many are not. I am the same way in my poems. Recently, I've battled with Clinical Depression and Manic Depression, or Bipolar. I've had asthma, but it's pretty much gone. I have ADHD, I guess... According to doctors for the past oh, i'd say 12 years. For the past 3 years of highschool, Freshman to Junior, I've let my academics slip. I lost the will and the care. Last year, me and a friend were going to sell our ADHD pills, make some money, ya know. Stupid shit you think of as kids. Parents found out before I could sell my first pill. Thankfully. But since then my relationship with my dad and step-mom has been strained. And it's descended into a personal hell. Recently, my poems and lyrics got dark. One ended with the sound of a gunshot. I don't know I'm in a different world when I write. I've never gotten close to committing. Ya know, suicide and all. Messy. Broken hearts. But recently, a reason not to do it, has been that my words would get twisted and distorted as would my reason. Life fucking blows, sure there is good but overall what's the point when you have no will to continue? My language has grown constantly vulgar. I've kept a journal recently. Such entrees include a persona of me, called Jesus Fish, where I am in a sea of fish, that vary in size, type, color, looks, and what not. But they are all just \"fish\". And as the Jesus version of fish, rather than dying for their sins, I am dying so they can all be happy. Not that my death brings joy, but in a way that I hurt myself and slowly kill myself so others can be happy. You know giving up love and shit. Today has been a hell hole. Basically being called a leech and worthless by your parents. I know I've thrown my life away but really? Maybe I'm just a whiny little bitch. Eh, can't really discuss much without appearing that way. So, yeah, I am. Anyways, my parents are in the house, in the living room as I sit at this table in the dining room. They don't know this but I've messaged friends, and I told them that... Well, for once I'm ready to actually kill myself. I just, It's finally a fucking option. An obvious one. It's now a fucking answer, ya know? This isn't my suicide note, or a letter to be found. No, I'm still alive, and I will be tomorrow. Unless I die in my sleep. I wrote this earlier though, \"I died as I lived, and I will live forever as something I wasn't. I'm not a martyr, I was simple.\" I died miserable, I lived miserable.

Because of that, I always lived with babysitters and my parents used to try and buy my love with video games. All I did for my life was go to the school and play on my Super Nintendo until bed time. Then I went to bed and used ti hear them fight over and over every single night. I was a really bad kid, though. I've had 17 different babysitters because they couldn't handle me. I think I did all of those stuff for attention, but that's bit relevant.\n\nUntil the 5th grade I was the pride of the family. My parents used to tell everybody how great I did in school and how smart I was. 5th grade came in, I realized that I used to suffer bullying on a daily basis since 2nd grade. I was called names, made fun of, and called gay regularly. I thought this happened to everybody so I just let it go through. 5 years later I am in 10th grade and I can't handle it anymore. My self esteem is almost negative and I'm starting to doubt of my own sexuality. By the way, I'm still addicted to video game until this day. Well, at least that's what my mother tells me every single day when she gets home stressed from work. I think what made me go this deep into my addiction was when my parents separates when I was 10. I tell everybody that its nothing and I'm over it, but I'm not. I've been rejected by every girl I ever liked, and that didn't contribute to my already low self esteem.\n\nAnyways, I'm 16 now and I'm on my last year of school. I'm still addicted, I think I'm bisexual and my mother doesn't help me. When the year started I couldn't get into the school I was used to, and where my friends were because there were no seats for me, so I had to go to the most expensive school in town. I can't handle the pressure there. I can't learn anything in school and I can't keep up with the rest of the class and I can't ask the teacher to help me because I'm afraid he'll call me a dumbass again. I've tried telling my mom all this, and it looked like it worked to a certain point but it hasn't. We still fight every single night, it has come to a point that when she gets home I hurt plug my headphones in so I don't have to listen to her complaining about every single bit of dust that I left on my computer. Its like she doesn't care if I'm fine. I know she does, but she makes it look like all she wants is for me to be flooded with homework every single day, regardless wether I learn stuff on school or not.\n\nI lived with my father last year because of these exact same problems but I couldn't handle staying away from my friends. It looked like it had worked things out between my mom and I but it didn't. Right now I'm crying myself to sleep and wondering if I should go to the school tomorrow or not. I probably won't, because if I'm going to cry for 6 hours straight and not learn shit I might aswell do it laying in my bed.\n\nI don't want to suicide. I don't want to be killed.

So here it goes, some parts get emotional for me but I want to bare it all, i'm asking on that deep of a level. \n\nMe and my brother are close, we have been through a lot, growing up with 2 heavily alcoholic parents isn't easy, the fighting made it less easy still, but I was always there for my little bro, shielded him from a lot and made sure he saw the good in our parents. He means the world to me, I would do anything for him. He got married over the summer and has 2 year old absolutely precious girl with his wife. His wife has a daughter from a previous relationship who is an absolute doll, and is part of our family now. He wants to give them the world, he wants his family to be how he remembers ours, minus the bad stuff I helped keep him away from. \n\nWe have lived in the same state all of our lives, I am 30, he is 24.. He got a job offer with the place he works for to take a chance and move to North Carolina, a nice part of greensboro to start a new life, a better life leaving all the negative baggage of Connecticut behind, for all of us, this is a much needed fresh start. He came to me as asked me to come with him, he said i could use this more than anyone. I have been struggling up here and kind of given up the last few years, been burnt by some ex's and some ex friends and roomates...But I want to go down there to help them, I know its scary for them and I know I can be of comfort, change like that doesn't scare me, it excites me. And he is taking a risk job wise, and things will be harder with no family to help, so I want to go down there and get a job and help them until they are steady, then move somewhere close by and start a family of my own.\n\n1500$ would be a great help going down there, i have to take care of everything here, last months rent in full and bills so Im not going to have anything going down there. The money would be spent on the following (will provide proof and receipts if necessary) this move will take place April 17th,18th,19th\n\n$360-2week rental car (Need to rent by 4/4)\n\n$300- gas for 2 trips down, 1 trip back (gotta drive down and look at the place)\n\n$400-my share of security and rent for april\n\nAny and all remaining funds would fill that house up with more food than those kids or us could eat, for a few weeks at least.\n\nI have seen the power of reddit, and I know you guys are awesome and have huge hearts. I believe in pay it forward to the fullest, and would make sure to do so. PM me, I don't have a pay pal or anything set up, should I? Never done anything like this, any advice you could give me to would be greatly appreciated.\n\nNow I understand $1500 is a lot to be asking for, I have read many posts and my heart breaks for a lot of these people. Now, I understand some people are struggling themselves, and just don't have $1500 to throw away, they need it. And I would never ask of anyone who could better use that money on themselves.. But some people do have a little more than the rest, some people are in good spots and have worked hard to have enough where giving back is possible. I urge you to at least try, I have never been a rich man but i have never felt richer than helping someone who really needed it. Maybe give them a couple hundred for groceries and I get to feel like a million dollars, decent trade to me. Knowing you helped someone not go hungry, or helped someone pay their rent that month they really needed it, or in my case helped a family move to a fresh new start, to start and raise a family of our own. \n","media":null,"link_flair_text":"REQUEST","permalink":"/r/Assistance/comments/21vww3/i_do_believe_in_miracles_and_i_do_believe_in_this/","is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"JackOfTrades11","link_flair_css_class":"request","gilded":0,"name":"t3_21vww3","id":"21vww3","archived":true,"num_comments":0,"author_flair_css_class":"registered","over_18":false,"saved":false,"score":1,"edited":1396380413,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s25d","created":1396322161,"from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/21vww3/i_do_believe_in_miracles_and_i_do_believe_in_this/","secure_media":null}

Everything I am about to say is so hard for me to admit. It is taking every ounce of truth and courage to go out and say this. So please, rather than judging me, please please help me. I don\u2019t know which subreddit this belongs in but I can see it qualifying in here.\n\nFirst a little background: I am 18 years old. I am the eldest of 7 and grew up poor in a broken home. I was physically and mentally abused. \n\nI have a problem that people find absolutely sickening. I am prepared for death threats and hate mail through pm. But I don\u2019t blame them. \n\nRecently I have been involved with sexual interactions. The girl is my best friend whom I love and care about. Anyway, when it happened, of course I loved it and it felt great with being with someone I love. We were both sober, and the intentions were mutual, so I thought. Recently she has been telling me or hinting that how horrible it was and how I threw myself onto her and she didn\u2019t want whatever was going on. I was heartbroken. She felt violated and betrayed. But I didn\u2019t realize this in my earlier conversation with her. I tried convincing her that it was mutual and she was into it and mentioned that she couldn\u2019t have done whatever she did without enjoying it. I was trying to justify it. But to be fair, it really did seem she was so into it. We laid in her bad afterwards and just cuddled up next to each other. About an hour later we were making out and she passionately ran her fingers through my hair with her left hand while her right hand on my cheek. I remember it in complete detail. I would never ever hurt her in any sort of way, emotionally or physically. I care about her way too much. \n\nSo what\u2019s the problem? The problem is that, deep down inside, under suppressed urges and lies, I do feel like I am capable of approaching someone like that. That I am able to be something as disgusting as that. That I\u2026 at this point tears are rushing down my cheeks and falling on my keyboard\u2026 I have feelings I shouldn\u2019t have for younger kids. And it\u2019s so wrong of me. I hate it so much. I can\u2019t talk to anyone about it because I acknowledge how disgusting it is. Let me be clear, I have NEVER acted on any feelings and or urges. But the fact that they\u2019re there absolutely sickens me. I hate myself for it. I am afraid that my entire life will be ruined if I try to talk to someone about it. I fight it everyday, and I win the battles, but I rather not feel like this. I rather not be who I am.

{"media":null,"selftext":"Hi FFA! Long time lurker, first time poster.  \n  \nI have a business convention coming up in ~10 days, and I desperately need some fashion advice. I'll be working at a booth for all three days, in a company shirt, and I have some serious fashion hangups (which I will detail in just a minute).  \n  \nThe most important thing to know, first and foremost, is that this event is a **video game convention**. This means that the normal convention booth business casual does not apply. I've been working my butt off for about a year to break into marketing in the video game industry, and I need to prove myself at the convention. Now I certainly know my stuff, but it always helps to look as confident as you feel... and that's where I need help!  \n  \n**Important Facts**    \n\n1. For all three days on the expo hall floor, I have to wear a black collared shirt with the company logo on the left breast. This company logo should be visible at all times. (See below for visual)\n2. The company logo is black, grey, blood red, and white.  \n3. The atmosphere/dress code is casual.\n4. No high heels! I'll be on my feet all day.  \n  \nThe look I'm going for is \"approach-ably cool\" - which I know doesn't give you much to go on, sorry! I'm open to pants, jeans, and skirts. Boots, flats, and small wedges are fine as well.  \n  \nSome info on my appearance and preferences: I'm an hourglass/pear that wears a size 8. I'm 24 years old, about 5'8'', with dark brown, curly hair that goes a little past my shoulders. Normally I wear preppy/chic clothes (think JCrew and Ann Taylor... I'm normally in business casual).This is my first experience with a casual wardrobe in a work environment... and I feel lost!  \n  \n**BONUS:** What does one wear to an after party at a work function? There is definitely a \"party\" atmosphere, but I don't want to be too revealing? (I don't party much... all I know about \"going out clothes\" I learned in college)\n  \n  \n**Shirt and Logo:**\n  \nhttp://imgur.com/a/u87rr  \n  \n\n\n","retrieved_on":1441599890,"ups":4,"permalink":"/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/21vyhk/casualcool_business_convention_with_uniform_what/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Casual/Cool Business Convention with Uniform - What to do?","subreddit":"femalefashionadvice","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1396319493","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.femalefashionadvice","quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":4,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s8o5","created":1396323093,"from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/21vyhk/casualcool_business_convention_with_uniform_what/","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"author":"yourhandsarecold","from":null,"is_self":true,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":7,"archived":true,"id":"21vyhk","name":"t3_21vyhk","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null}

It makes me feel like such a lesser person. \n\nBut I guess I am a lesser person because I'm realizing that I can't deal with the reality of becoming an adult. I have 3 jobs currently, am a full time student, I have 0 time for a personal life of any sort, I'm trying to hold back the flood waters of crippling anxiety and depression that NOBODY knows about, and I just fucking can't bring myself to care about the future because I'm so busy trying to just survive day to day. Trying not to fall apart under this mountain of schoolwork and expectations, trying to not be bitter that, at 21, I've never had a relationship, never even been kissed. I've never had anyone besides my family tell me they love me. I have all this shit that I'm trying to cope with, and I don't want anyone to know, but I'm 3 steps away from relapsing into self-harm just to make myself feel better.\n\nAnd they sit there and plan their future and I can't say anything because I don't have any dreams anymore except to make it through the week. But like, it's fine, because if I were to tell anyone, they'd call me out on \"fake depression\" and \"doing it for attention\" just because I'm not diagnosed. I\"m not 15 anymore. I know something is wrong. \n\nIt's fine, talk about your dreams. You can talk about them. There's nothing wrong with that. Sorry for being bitter. I'll try to be a more supportive friend. \n\n","domain":"self.offmychest","hide_score":false,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"offmychest","created_utc":"1396319543","author_flair_text":null,"title":"My friends are talking about the future, and it makes me feel sick.","secure_media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self"}
