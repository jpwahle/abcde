I had a sober twin but she stopped posting here unfortunately, so any other twins, holler back.\n\nI'm not really suffering much with cravings etc, but my brain did decide to celebrate the occasion with a dream about drinking last night. Thanks, brain! For the most part, things are improving. My body is repairing itself, physically and mentally.\n\nWhat I am suffering a little with is what looks a lot like the dreaded Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome. Specifically, over the last week or two I've felt uncomfortably agitated quite a lot of the time and sometimes that has tipped over into episodes of nasty anxiety and/or depression, which thankfully have usually resolved themselves by the end of the day. Information out there about PAWS is confusing, with some sources saying it peaks at 4-8 weeks and some saying 3-6 months. I know every case is different, but I'm looking for any advice people have on what I can expect and anything I can do to make it less unpleasant. I need to do a better job with exercise and meditation, although it's difficult to sit down to meditate when I am agitated.\n\nBrief life story if it helps: I am 37 and male. Drinking started to become excessive about 8-9 years ago, but really got out of control about 1.5 years ago partly in response to a stressful life situation. Started drinking 1-2 bottles of wine a night most nights, with a few weeks off occasionally. Didn't drink during the day. Never \"hit bottom\" or anything but quit due to deteriorating physical and mental health and the knowledge that I had lost control. No assistance other than friends and r/StopDrinking, and no acute withdrawal worse than some cravings and depression. Have not attended any meetings and don't feel that AA is for me, but there are SMART meetings near here that I could attend if people think it would help. Am in no danger of relapse, in fact the more unpleasant things get at the moment, the more I am regarding alcohol with a healthy fear.","archived":false,"permalink":"/r/stopdrinking/comments/5rc1ni/two_months_today_paws_question/","media":null,"author_flair_css_class":"month3","suggested_sort":null,"score":9,"is_self":true,"link_flair_text":null,"hide_score":false,"author_flair_text":"102 days","edited":false,"gilded":0,"media_embed":{},"brand_safe":false,"over_18":false}

Note: throughout my life I lived with my sister and I lived with my dad and around age 10 he remarried and we moved hours away 3 years later. I'd visit my mother on a schedule.\n\n-3rd grade my parents divorced, they divorced because of my mothers alcoholism, wasting my fathers money, and abuse of prescription drugs. At the time I was not aware of this.\n\n-around age 11 I begin to notice what things are and can see she is irresponsible, essentially a whore (we'd stay with a new guy every few weeks, often times a repeated guy), I could tell she drank waaayy more than my dad and my friends parents.\n\n- when I was 12 she had been living with this one guy for 6 or so months, I heard from a friend that one day he knocked on my door and saw what he thought was cocaine on the table. I later found a shoebox under her bed with several baggies of cocaine empty and full, but I kept it to myself.\n\n- when I'm 13 she's with this one guy off and on and we live with him at an oil field house, one night there was a big fight and my sister came to pick us up at 2am and I didn't know what happened but my mom and her bf seemed very weird and were saying things that didn't make sense. My sister reveals that a guy she knew in high school who dealt drugs told her they had been buying meth and prescription pills from him for a while.\n\n- 13 or 14 she goes to rehab and a week after she gets back she's arrested for UPCS and my dad (police officer) said it was meth and oxycodone.\n\n-14 she's bailed out and we don't visit her\n\n-15 we start to visit her and she's with a good guy who has a good reputation. She drinks too much but he helps her and stops her a lot.\n\n-16 everything seems good and we're with another goodish guy who has money (now I see why she was with him) but he breaks things off for reasons we aren't told.\n\n-17 she lives by herself, has a nice job, seems okay. One day I get home from school and my stepmom said she was arrested the night before for UPCS and not getting bailed out\n\n-18 she's released from jail, living with her mother, has a job, single. As of now nothing bad.\n\nShe sends me texts constantly, I don't reply. She sends me mail and packages a lot. The only bad thing is I kinda have to cut off everybody on that side of the family. I have only seen my grandma and nephews one in a year and half or so. I haven't seen my brothers in probably 2 years, and about 3 for my older sister. I also have a new nephew from one of my brothers that I've never met and he's about  8 months old. I also have my uncle Charlie who I love spending time with, he's about 78 now and won't be around much longer- I haven't seen him in a year either. All because of my mothers idiotic actions and irresponsibility I am stuck without several of my immediate family members. I have little sympathy for her and I usually block her out and whenever friends ask I just say she moved to California and I haven't or talked to her since- it's just too much trouble and embarrassment to tell the whole story. \n\nI want advice or whether or not I should even visit her after I graduate since I'm moving from Texas to Alabama in August. I don't really want to see her, in fact when I think of her the word mom doesn't come to mind, I mostly see her as an old acquaintance as I can barely remember how she talks or anything. Should I visit her in order to see everyone else in my family? Or just save myself the trouble of everything? I know my dad and stepmom dont want me to see her.\n\nThanks for any advice","permalink":"/r/Advice/comments/5rc319/in_need_of_advice_about_what_i_m18_should_do/","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjdm","contest_mode":false,"subreddit":"Advice","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5rc319/in_need_of_advice_about_what_i_m18_should_do/","secure_media":null,"domain":"self.Advice","author":"awayithrow1323","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"In need of advice about what I [m/18] should do pertaining the situation of my mother [f/41?]","id":"5rc319","num_comments":2,"stickied":false,"hidden":false,"quarantine":false,"retrieved_on":1489495284,"locked":false,"spoiler":false,"thumbnail":"self","created_utc":1485907695,"distinguished":null,"link_flair_css_class":null}

I recently put on 25lbs in a short amount of time (around a month) and after that, I started getting this pretty terrible foot pain on the bottom of my left heel and sometimes on the top of my left foot.\n\nAfter a month of pain, I went to my doctor who said I have Plantars Fasciitis. \n\nHe said it's mostly likely due to my weight, but he also said it could be because I have a 'click' in my left ankle.  He said I should try to some stretching exercises every day and see how it goes. If it was still a problem, we would come back to it in later months. \n\nA month has come and gone and my fat ass hasn't lost any weight. The stretches do help with the foot pain without a doubt, but it's far from gone.\n\nI want to start walking (only walking, no running) to help me lose weight. I know it takes more than that, but I just want to know if walking will permanently damage my plantar fascia. \n\nI know there are other forms of exercise but right now, walking is honestly the best for me. Long story short, I can't cycle, I can't swim. I haven't tried Pilates but I will if walking is out of the picture.  \n\nOne reason I'm adamant about walking is because I suffer from depression and anxiety and walking has always helped me combat that. If it matters, I'm on 20mg Citalopram daily, 15mg Mirtazapine daily, and my birth control is 75mg cerazette daily. I also take fish oil supplements and vitamins to try to combat the foot pains from inflammation.\n\nI don't think I've forgotten anything. Please forgive misspelling as I'm on my phone.

I'm wondering if this is normal, and how to deal with that?\n\nIgnoring it isn't an option unless I stop using social media at all and going out generally.\n\nTl;Dr: never get complimented.

It has only been a year but I feel like I know she is the one I love more than anything in the whole world, I'd do anything for her and she is my everything. When we first started dating she was in her senior year and very stressed out and had a lot of family things going on so we decided to take a break for a little while, we both said we loved each other and wanted to make this work in the future. After about 6 months of being apart we got back together and have been more happy than anything but she jus recently told me that while we were broken up she hooked up with her ex. This hurt me really bad because we were on a break and I thought we were being exclusive to each other also she said she still loved me and if she still loved me how could she fuck him. I haven't talked to her in 4 days and she's been telling me about how we are meant to be together and how the past is in the past. I really want to get over this and continue our relationship as it was but everytime I think about her my stomach hurts and I think about her with that other man and I don't know if I can't get passed this.

{"archived":false,"selftext":"I have come to the conclusion my mom is an E and my dad is a N. I try to talk to my mom (she asks to talk) and when we do it just ends up blowing up. She mocks me for when I say anything she is doing that's wrong (being a hypocrite, enabler, toxic, just plain old being mean) she throws back in my face. If I say something about my father like I say often how toxic he is she will just twist my words and say back \"well u think I'm so toxic\" I never say that!!! When I say she's a hypocrite she mocks me and says \"I know I'm the fucking worst get over it\" like I try to have adult conversations but anytime I say anything she doesn't like she starts acting like the child. She tells me I need to stop \"living in the past\" when in reality nothing was ever fixed so how can I move in??? She thinks just bc she acknowledges that they had problems in the past I'm never allowed to bring it up again or I'm the bad one. Like when I bring up past events (even as little as 6 months ago) she gets angry and tells me to move on taking the whole conversation as a joke. When I tell her that my dad is toxic and he makes everyone around him toxic she just says that not everyone is perfect and I can't just cut them off. Saying my dad is a narcissist is like saying I hope he dies. Like she treats it as if I'm saying something horrible. I tell her I'm just stating a fact. It's not mean it's the truth. I'm really upset b/c me and my moms (my mom and I's???) relationship used to be good. But when I started seeing my dad for who he really was. (I am 15 and I started doing extensive research on narcissists and their behavior and the effect it has in children and family I came to realize that he is an extreme narcissist and it's very unhealthy for everyone.) and I started voicing this she gets angry that I say those things about him. It's like a sin to call him toxic. My mom also gets very angry when she thinks about what I tell my friends and how they think of our family. she says \"no one is perfect but I just bet u tell them horrible stuff about us\" she claims I never acknowledge any good they do.

There is a part 3 but i don't think its very good and its kinda weird but i will post its anyway\n\npt.2 http://forum.smokingpalace.net/showthread.php?t=208505\n\n\n\nKristen woke to her usual deep hacking cough, and she felt considerable pride as she felt the deep tar deposits in her lungs shift during the cough. Still hacking, she reached to her nightstand for her ever-present pack of Virginia Slims, and placed the firm, long filter between her full 23 year-old lips. As she had done every moring for the last five years since she first put her hands on the locket that would completely change her life, she brought the flame from her pink Bic lighter to the tip of the cigarette and inhaled the smoke hungrily.\n\nThe first cigarette of the day was her favorite in the endless stream of cigarettes that she would consume in the following hours. Exhaling her first drag, she sucked on the tip of the browning cigarette for five seconds. Inhaled the smoke forcefully, and returned to suck on the tip for another ten seconds, still holding the smoke from the previous drag deep inside her lungs.\n\nShe repeated the process again and again until the cigarette was nothing but a disformed blackened lump in the tips of her fingers, savoring every minute that she bathed her brittle, blackened lungs in the rich smoke. Her lungs were the lungs of a 40-year smoker, even though she had only put in five of those years herself. Since the first cigarette she had smoked in her mother's lungs, she had desired almost nothing else but the dirty end of a burning cancer stick. She was constantly aroused by the thought of thought of the smoke that settled into her body, becoming a permanent part of the her collection of tar and poison.\n\nShe smoked her second cigarette of the morning at a more leisurely pace, before chaining into her third and final pre-shower cylinder. Finally getting out of bed, she made her way to the bathroom to brush her teeth and start running her morning shower. As she undressed, she admired herself as always in the mirror: her skin was still beautiful and tight, though lines were starting to show around her lips. She admired her still-full lips in the mirror, and noted with satisfaction the light yellow stains just below her nostrils, the result of danging and nose-exhaling almost five packs of Virginia Slims a day. She had completely given up on removing the stains on her fingers: they were a dark brown between the two fingers she held her cigarettes, with a single brown smudge on her thumb where she would hold the smoke back from the filter.\n\nLetting out another deep hacking cough, she jumped in the shower and pondered the day. This was a big day for her: she was getting her first physical exam in years, at the insistence of her mother April who was becoming increasingly alarmed by the sounds coming out of her 23 year-old daughter. April had quit smoking the same week Kristen started, and now the roles were completely reversed: it was her mother who complained about the cost and smell of her daughter's Virginia Slims habit, and her mom who worried about Kristen's constant cough and shortness of breath.\n\nKristen wasn't looking forward to going to the doctor and getting a lecture, but it probably wouldn't be so bad -- she could truthfully tell the doctor that she had only been smoking for five years. She was young and still in fairly good physical shape externally, despite the state of her interior decay.\n\nDrying off, Kristen placed her fourth cigarette of the day between her lips and savored the taste of her first post-shower cigarette. Cigarettes always tasted best just after she brushed her teeth: her body loved the smoke that she fed it constantly, but she could only really taste that first post-brushing smoke.\n\nKnowing that she wouldn't be able to smoke at the doctor's office, and a little self-conscious about her constant reek of smoke, she popped a couple pieces of nicotine gum in her mouth as she finished off the cigarette, and went downstairs to kiss her mom off for the morning.\n\nTraffic was bad that morning, and the drive to the doctor took almost thirty minutes. The entire time she was chewing frantically on her nicotine gum, sneaking longing glances at the pack of perfectly white filters in the passenger seat to her. Arriving at the office, she popped one last piece of gum in her mouth and went to check in for her appointment.\n\nKristen waited nearly fifteen minutes in the appointment room before the doctor came in. She spent the entire time crossing and uncrossing her legs, fidgeting, and dreaming of her post-appointment cigarette. It had been almost an hour since her last cigarette, and she rarely went for more than 15 minutes without a french cancer stick pillaging her lungs. Even with the gum, she was an anxious wreck, and very conscious of the deep hacking cough that kept punctuating the silence of the appointment room.\n\nThe doctor finally knocked and entered. She appeared to be in her late 30s, and introduced herself as Helen.\n\n\"What brings you into the office today, Kristen?\"\n\nKristen fidgeted a bit, finding it hard to concentrate without her cigarettes.\n\n\"Well, I haven't been in for a checkup in awhile, and I've had a pretty bad cough recently. My mom wanted to just get things checked out.\"\n\n\"OK, let's start by taking your blood pressure, and then I'd like you to cough a few times for me while I listen to your chest and see if we can figure out what's going on. It's flu season, and you might need some antibiotics to clear things up. But let's see where we're at first.\"\n\nHelen made a few notes and frowned as she took Kristen's blood pressure, and then put her stethoscope to Kristen's chest and asked her to cough. Kristen had actually been holding a cough back since Helen came in, and she was happy to oblige. She let out a wet, hacking bark, but wasn't able to stop coughing for at least a minute after she started. When the cough finally subsided, she moved the ball of phleghm around in her mouth for another few seconds, savoring the taste of burnt smoke and residiual nicotine.\n\nHelen looked positively alarmed.\n\n\"That's one of the worst coughs I've heard in my life, dear. I take it that you're a cigarette smoker?\"\n\n\"Yes, I've been smoking for about five years now, but I'm still so young... I know you'll lecture me about it, but I plan to give it up when I'm 30,\" Kristen lied.\n\n\"How many cigarettes do you smoke a day?\"\n\nKristen pretended to count a little in her head, though thinking about cigarettes just made her want another cigarette.\n\n\"I think on a usual day, I smoke about half a pack to a pack of cigarettes,\" Kristen lied again. She felt bad lying about cigarettes, her best friend, but was also self-conscious about getting a lecture from the doctor.\n\nHelen made a few notes in her chart.\n\n\"This sounds like a pretty bad smoker's cough to me. I'm surprised it's this bad since you really only have about 2-3 pack-years of smoking, and you're still so young.\" She frowned.\n\nKristen did a little math in her head to estimate the actual pack-years -- her mother had smoked about three packs a day for 35 years, and Kristen had brought that number up to almost five packs a day for the last five years. She struggled with the math a little in her head, but came up with the alarming number of 130 pack-years of smoking. She felt herself getting a little wet at the thought of it. That was close to a million cigarettes that had touched her once pink, beautiful lungs. She gave another cough.\n\n\"Even though you don't smoke very much, some people have a harder time with cigarettes than others. I'd strongly suggest you try to cut back a bit; from the sound of it, I think it would be very good if you could quit smoking entirely, and well before your 30th birthday. I'd like to run a few chest x-rays just to make sure we haven't missed anything, and then you can be on your way. I don't think there's any prescription that will really help much -- you need to just cut out the smoking.\"\n\n\"That's probably smart,\" Kristen lied again, \"I'll give it a serious try this week.\"\n\nHelen made a few more notes on her chart, and sent Kristen out for the x-rays.\n\nThe x-rays were quick and painless, and Kristen managed to suppress her urge to cough during the entire process. As she sucked hungrily on her gum, she couldn't wait for the second she could step outside of the doctor's office and put a firm Virginia Slims filter between her lips, sucking the tip to life and breathing in the smoke that always made her feel better, like a real person. Her best friend, and her best lover.\n\nThe radiology tech frowned a little as he looked at the images on his screen. \"I'd like to have the doctor read these while you're here, if you're not in a rush -- I don't love what I'm seeing, but the doctor would know best. It should only take 15 or 20 minutes.\"\n\nKristen groaned and moved some phleghm around in her mouth. \"Yeah, that's fine. I have another appointment later this morning, but I can stick around for a few minutes. If it takes longer than that, can you just call me?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure that's best,\" frowned the tech. He led Kristen back to the same appointment room she had met Helen in a few minutes earlier.\n\nKristen fidgeted for a few more minutes in the office, thinking about the pleasure waiting for her as soon as she could step outside. Her mouth was practically salivating by the time Helen returned to the room.\n\nHelen looked alarmed when she returned to the room.\n\n\"Kristen, you'll want to sit down for this. I'm not good with sugarcoating news, so I'll just say it up front. I don't know how this is possible, but the x-rays revealed some very abnormal growths on your lungs. We need to run more tests, but it looks very much like you have lung cancer -- and fairly advanced lung cancer, at that. You need to quit smoking immediately, and if everything I'm seeing is correct, you'll need to start chemotherapy immediately if you want to have any chance of living to see your 30th birthday.\"\n\nThe next few minutes passed in a haze for Kristen. She was completely floored by the news. She always knew that her inherited lungs were fucked, and she had always taken pleasure in feeling them get more and more full with smoke, but she never expected something like lung cancer, especially when she was 23. The million cigarettes had taken their toll faster than she could have ever expected.\n\nKristen felt faint.\n\n\"Dear, I'm not sure you should be alone right now. Can I call you a cab home? Is there someone at home that you can be with right now?\" Helen asked.\n\n\"My mom is home... I'm OK... I just need to go back and lie down. This is all so sudden.\"\n\nAfter a few more hazy minutes, Kristen made an appointment at the hospital for the next day for more tests and x-rays. And figuring out the start of the last section of her life.\n\nKristen walked out of the office and got into her car. She noticed the smell of stale cigarette smoke, and looked down at her car's ashtray. It was overflowing with disformed, blackened Virginia Slims butts. She counted at least thirty in the ashtray alone, and several more had overflowed onto the ground beneath her.\n\nHer hands shaking badly, she took a long white cigarette out of her path and looked at it. Her best friend. How could he do it to her? She knew that she needed to quit smoking immediately, but she couldn't stop herself from picking up her pink Bic lighter and bringing the cylinder to life. She inhaled hungrily on the cigarette, again and again, with relief rushing into her cancerous lungs. Smoking her cigarette in record time, she chained into a second cancer stick from the butt of the first, and then a third, and a fourth.","archived":false,"permalink":"/r/darksidesmokingfetish/comments/5rcdoq/kristens_locket_part_2/","author_flair_css_class":null,"suggested_sort":null,"score":7,"media":null,"is_self":true,"link_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"hide_score":false,"gilded":0,"media_embed":{},"brand_safe":false,"over_18":true,"link_flair_css_class":null,"distinguished":null,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"nsfw","created_utc":1485910848,"retrieved_on":1489495430,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"hidden":false,"num_comments":4,"id":"5rcdoq","author":"underground272","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"kristens locket part 2","secure_media":null,"domain":"self.darksidesmokingfetish"}

I'd get these stupid crushes on girls I'd meet in my classes and in student organizations and I'd always feel like shit since I knew there's no way they would ever think I'm cute or funny or interesting.  Whenever I'd try to talk to them they'd seem either uncomfortable or totally bored and I'd feel bad for wasting their time.  I'd spend lots of money on a nice haircut and clothes but eventually I realized that it's stupid and a waste of time for me to try to impress people.  I'd talk to therapists and they'd tell me I have self esteem issues and it's in my head but I know it's not, if anyone here could see what I'm like and how I look they'd know exactly what I mean.

Guess Nmum has been looking for a go all day since the first thing she said to me today was \"You didn't say goodbye to me before you left, you should at least say goodbye / you never do anymore\". I told her that she was locked in her room, presumably asleep - must it be my responsibility to wake her up and make sure my day starts by greeting the ~queen~? I nicely told her she was full of foolery and I say goodbye when I know she's awake. I'm 20, do I really need (implicit) permission to leave? \n\nAnyways midday she tells me we can go pay our bills this afternoon, I agree, not realizing I'd have stuff to do. This next event is mostly my doing but I'll rant anyways. We were supposed to meet to do errands together but I was dead tired and still had school work today, had a massive headache, and wanted to put off this until later which was fine since it wasn't anything urgent. We didn't even need to do it together, I called Nmum to attempt to explain my position then gets upset about me flaking, I'm so inconsiderate, she had other stuff to do and now she'll have to wait. I agree it wasn't my best move but her argument would be more convincing if she didn't wake up in the late afternoons regularly and wasn't sitting in front of the telly 85% of the time. Yet this one time she acts like I've severely messed up her entire life when she has an embarrassing amount of free time. No discussion was had since she just hang up on me (typical). I catch hell for never adequately discussing (read: arguing) things but she'll hang up on me mid-sentence like some edgy teen. \n\nI'm trying not to feel guilty because I know that's what she wants, and despite the fact she in the right this time I know she's going to exploit this excessively. \n\nWe were having a long time of peace since her last explosion before winter holiday. Ugh, I hope this is just out of place, I really don't want to be subject to emotional torment daily again, I can't afford to move out right now and my plans to study abroad have been halted by my academic progress (or lack thereof).

I didn't really need them to tell me, I know it myself. I've had a number of really rough rejections that make it really hard for me to put myself out there plus the obsessive thinking that comes with ADHD tends to mean that I will like a girl from a distance, build up a fantasy in my head and either be too scared to talk to them or miss my moment by a long shot then suffer when I get rejected.\n\nI'm not talking about anything sinister here, just being a bit obsessive.\n\nI met a girl at work a few months ago and haven't stopped thinking about her since. I felt sure that we were going to get together. I feel like I can be myself around her more than I have with anyone before and managed to ask her out like a normal human being. She said she was seeing someone but I don't think that's true. We talk a lot and she's never mentioned him to me or anyone else. I'd like to believe she's nervous about getting involved with anyone but I realise it's more likely she didn't want to hurt my feelings by saying she isn't interested.\n\nI've got it so bad for her. Much worse than usual. I've been getting in really good shape lately and have been getting a lot of attention from women. I've turned down several stunning women because I can't bear the idea of being with anyone else. I'm so depressed about it.\n\nI don't want to be a creep but I think I'm just wired to be one.

I'm 29 so I've been around long enough to know the rules but I can't help but act like I'm 14 when it comes to women.\n\nBefore anyone says it, I know about rejection sensitive dysphoria.

He was 16 and I am 15, so this was a shock for both our parents but they allowed us to challenge ourselves. I believed that I could get away without a specialized training and that my conditioning could pull me through so my only training was a 20 mile run two weeks beforehand at a little slower than race pace. \n\n### Pre-race\nOh boy. The night before I made my first mistake and decided to go out with my girlfriend, resulting in me not carb-loading or enough sleep. Next morning I woke up at 4:30 for the race and didn't eat anything. At the starting line everyone was staying as warm as they could at 40 degrees in short shorts, at 6:45 they brought us to the corral for a 7:00 starting time.\n\n### Race\nWe were cocky. So cocky we went in the very front and ran a 6:30 mile to start. However early on we realized that we had a loooong way to go, and settled into a pace in the low 7s. We met this guy named Jodie and ran together until around the half-way point, at which something horrible happened. People talk about the 'wall' and how much it hurts around mile twenty blah blah blah. Without any eating I hit it very early on and HOLY BALLS!! My feet felt like bricks and every muscle felt like knots. 50 year old men and women just kept chugging along while im suffering and embarrassed. At one point, I think around 17 both my hamstrings tightened simultaneously and I couldn't help but lay down on the side of the road, fetal position until they relaxed. This was the darkest time during my lonely \njourney from mile 13.1 to 24. With two miles left something turned on and I felt half decent, my pace didn't improve but I kept going until I crossed the finish line.\nYou can see how much I slowed in the second portion, my average pace for the first half was 7:01 but my overall was 8:53.\n\n### Post-race\nI hadn't eaten solid food in hours, so I grabbed some southern cuisine and chowed down. \nI got a shirt and a cool medal, also got a news interview with my friend, who finished in 17th place and a time of 3:17 WOWOWOW\nNext Year I plan on running it again with more friends from the team, as well as planning, training, and eating much better.

So I started my keto journey back on September 15, 2014. I weighed 211.2 pounds and I got down to 153 at one point, but comfortably maintained at 157-160lbs. I am 5'10\" and I LOVEX how I looked and how I felt. I had lost it all and by the end of June 2014 and kept it all off a little over a year. Then the cheating started and I got my dream job and slowly weight crept back on. At first it was 8 lbs and I kept trying to lose it and then it was 12 and then 15 and now it's 17. I thought I could get away with a cheat here and there and I did for a while. I maintained and any water weight gain went right back down... until cheating turned into just not doing keto. I am up 17lbs. I have been trying to recommit, I am trying to track again, but for some reason my protein is always high (it wasn't the case before and idk what I am doing differently). I understand I am starting from scratch again and I can't eat like I did a year in where I just wasn't all that hungry, but I need some help and motivation. I am MISERABLE. Gaining back 17 lbs is better than all of it; I'm still 34 lbs lighter, but my clothes don't fit and I am beyond uncomfortable. I am so depressed and disappointed in myself. I swore I'd never gain it back and go back to feeling how I did pre-keto and now I'm scared the scale will keep climbing. I have tracked and started working out (which I hadn't done the first time) and the scale keeps going UP. I'm so discouraged but I need to lose this weight I have gained. I'm also back to being constipated (the first time I stared I didn't go for 13 days. It was horrid, but it went back to normal).  Keto seemed so much easier the first time around. Has anyone else gained back some weight and then lost it again and keep it off?  I need some encouragement.  I try to remind myself that it took a long time for me to see results the first time, but the scale never went up.

{"selftext":"[Link](http://imgur.com/a/6xJCf)\n\nSo I finally broke $1,000 today! it's been a long time coming. But I can't complain 15% growth over 6 months is better than 1% or .001% over a year.\n\nI originally started with about $5,000 over the summer and as time progressed I added about $3,000. Going with the notion of takes money to make money, and having more allows easier growth. Here a short background story for context.\n\nI started using robinhood this summer while I was working 4 jobs, A Desk Job, FedEx, Bookstore, and Hospital Job. I'm pretty sure I worked over ~90hrs a week and busted my behind. I looked into how I would make my money work for me instead of working for my money.I read and lurked from many forums/subreddits including the basics of /r/investing and /r/personal finance. I learned from there that Savings accounts don't make squat unless they're credit unions. I made an account with a Credit Union but their processing process took forever so I looked to find another bank that had a decent savings account. My local banks offered something of .001%, but somewhere I read the idea of online banks so I turned to Ally who has a 1% savings account rate, and I thought this was astronomically better! Reading into things even more I eventually stumbled upon this genius service called \"Robinhood\". A stock trading app that requires no commission, why the heck not, so what they don't offer OTC (Man how I wanted to trade Nintendo on the PokemonGo boom).\n\nAnyways I started with $5,000 and looked for ideas of stocks to trade. I fell into the $MSTX hype (RIP) Losing, regaining, and then gaining again. From all this stress I decided never will I try penny stocks again. I'm still opened to 3x Leveraged ETFs however. Anyways as I continued to work and trade $BCS, RBS, $TVIX (go to hell who ever suggested this), $SCTY, $TWLO, $GEVO, $DGLY, $MGTI, $NVAX, $TREE, MGT, $COST, $F, $NUGT, $GPRO, $TSLA, $APPL, - I saved up $3,000 more and put that back into robinhood. I broke $500, then $700, then $900, and as I was about to break $1000, $AOBC decided to tank as well as $XRX. I patiently waited for it to come back up while averaging town and WALLAH today I have broken $1,000. So here I am 21 and with a goal of paying off my student debt as well as saving for retirement! I am currently now waiting to see if $XOM will rise. I've learned a bit of strategy as well as lessons from my experience, which are:\n\n* Don't Chase the Run!\n\n* Patiently wait a few weeks if something doesn't go your way\n\n* If you can average down and are committed, then its probably better to do so.\n\n* Don't listen to /r/wallstreetbets\n\n* Don't listen to /r/wallstreetbets\n\n* Dividend stocks are your friend.\n\n* 1% everyday is better and more likely than a gold mine of 10% gain in one day. Pennies make nickels, which make dimes, which make quarters, which make DOLLARS. \n\nAnyways that's my short (not so short) 1st post on this subreddit, please let me know if you have any questions, and if you can provide any advice/wisdom I will gladly take it!

UIDs are also covered, but I'm a little scared of having something that invasive. Also, my boyfriend (almost-fiance) is planning on having a vasectomy in the summer, so I'm not too worried. I had a consult with my primary physician and she referred me to a women's clinic in my network for the procedure. Awesome.\n\nI'm a little bit of a wimp, so I asked my supportive grandmother to come with me to hold my hand during the procedure. \n\nThe lobby for the women's clinic was filled with screaming semen demons and pregnant women not paying attention to their screeching hordes. My tokophobia was tingling the entire time. \n\nI finally got called in half an hour after my appointment time by a nurse with a horribly annoying voice. I asked if my grandma could sit in, and the nurse agreed without a thought. \n\nIt turned out that it was another consultation, which was different from what I was told when I made the appointment. I wasn't there for my implant. She started the consultation by asking the normal very personal questions... in front of my grandmother. Mind you, she didn't warn me of the personal questions (\"How many sexual partners have you had?\") when I asked if I can bring my grandma with me. I had already been through this process with my primary. Gma stepped outside while I answered. \n\nAfter the personal questions, my gma came back in. The nurse then asked with a big smile, \"Now, when are you planning on having a baby?\"\n\n\"Uh, never.\"\n\n\"Oh, why noooooooooooooooooot?\" Imagine the most grating, whiny voice asking that.  \"Oh, you'll change your mind. You'll meet someone, etc.\"\n\n\"I actually hate it when people say that. I'm 30. I know my mind; I know what I want.\"\n\nAt this point, my gma was pissed on my behalf and said, \"Well, some people just don't have kids. Her boyfriend doesn't want kids either.\"\n\nThe nurse just rolled her eyes, shrugged, and said, \"I guess there's someone for everyone then...\"\n\nThis nurse was entirely incompetent. She treated vaping as though it was the same as chain smoking (spoiler: it's not). She had me answer questions while checking my blood pressure, which made my pressure look as though I was about to have a heart attack. She took it four times, leaving ugly stretchmark-like markings on my arms because the band was so tight. \n\nThankfully, I will have my implant on the 24th. I just hope she's nowhere near me by then.

My name is Paige, I am 19 years old and  I am probably one of the most wild and outgoing sluts you'll run into. I am 5'5. I have brown hair with some pink and purple streaks going through it, blue eyes, like the color of the sky. Now my breasts are a hassle because I can go from B to C cups and my ass surely is my best feature, nice and jiggly, for a petite girl like myself, I have an ass that causes confusion and I love being spanked. I am also pale and have freckles. Which apparently is very hot. \n\nOh yes and I am a bisexual girl. But this does not mean I am going to accept messages from men. I am sorry, but I do not like role playing with guys. I don't care if you are a male willing to play female, I won't play with you. So if you message me, guys, you'll get a nice and kind \"no thank you\" from me. Being bisexual means that I want a male concept in the role play and those males will be controlled by myself (unless you want to share control). If you don't like to have males in the role play, I understand and we can work other out something else, but for the women who are also bisexual and like the idea of two girls having their way with a man. You will have my priority. But for all the lesbians, please, do not hesitate to message me either, you still will have my attention. \n\nNow here is a little bit more about me when it comes to why I think I'll be one of the biggest sluts you'll run into. When it comes to my role plays, I usually would like to add in all or most of my kinks. Now, my kinks can be wild for a lot of people. So if you aren't into them, please, respect me because I won't judge you for yours. And if you want to get into a role play with me but do not like a certain kink, let me know and we might be able to work around it or add in something else to make up for it. Now, here is my rather naughty list of kinks. Again, respect me and my kinks and you'll get nothing but love from me. \n\nMy Kinks are the following: Anal, Assplay, Ageplay, Bestiality, Choking, Deepthroating, Double Penetration, Gaping, Gagging, Gangbangs, Groups, Incest, Knotting, Hotdogging, Spanking, Public, Lingerie/Panties, Squirting, Tittyfucking, Risky Sex(bare sex), Creampies, Cumshots, Ass Worship, Competition, Cum, Face-Fucking, Face-Sitting, Gloryholes, Hair Pulling, Handjobs/Fingering, Kidnapping, Large Cocks, Masturbation, Mutual Masturbation, Non-Con, Rimming#, Sex Toys, Sloppy Seconds, Swallowing, Clothed Sex, Strap ons, Drugs#,and Teasing. \n\nNow, this isn't the full list of things I like, these are just the favorites. There are a few other things that I like that I couldn't think of at the time of writing this, so hopefully, we are compatible and like most of the same things. \n\nMy limits are hard, so I will NOT be using these at all. If you want it, I am sorry, but I won't be able to play with it. Though I respect your kinks, like I want others to do with me. \n\nMy Limits are the following: Watersports, Fisting, Gore, Death, Blood#, Poo and Pee (Anything bathroom related), Puke, Dom/Sub#, Bondage, Encasement, Cutting, and Innocence.\n\nNow I am sure some of you are wondering what the # means by some of the kinks or limits. It just means I have exceptions or details about them. And they are these.\n\n*Drugs- Will not play anything hard., will only involve weed.*    \n*Blood- Blood from first time sex is okay. Nothing more.*    \n*Dom/Sub- I do not play either. We will be equals when it comes to sexual acts.*    \n*Rimming- Will not rim a male.*\n\nAnd now, for the ending of my post. I am sorry that it is so long and I made you read so much, I promise that if you give me effort with your writing, we can have a lot of fun together. So, if you want to be part of this, please, send me something about yourself. I DO NOT want you to start the role play off and expect me to continue what you wrote. If you do, I will only reply with my reaction to the post. This is something I need to discuss and plan before actaully getting into. I love details and a plotline. I don't want to just go off of whatever is written. Now, if you have stuck around and read the whole thing, I want you to tell me about yourself, who you want to be in reference to my character. Your appearance and if there are any kinks you'd like to add in (as long as they aren't any of my limits) Again, please, I want you to discuss this with me and not start off something on your own because I have an idea of where this is going to start and if you give me an opening that I don't like, it will ruin my idea and probably my mood to play this.\n\nThanks for reading!","archived":false,"permalink":"/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/5rcqi1/19_f4f_i_wanna_be_a_naughty_little_slut/","contest_mode":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_3656x","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/5rcqi1/19_f4f_i_wanna_be_a_naughty_little_slut/","subreddit":"AgeplayPenPals"}

It's a pretty decent story.\n\n**19 -- Rise and Fall** (Short Trips volume 1)\n\nThis is a complete story told in a 26-minute episode. It is narrated by William Russell, though (necessarily) in the third person. Russell gets the Doctor's voice and mannerisms just right, and his narration is good. I hope I can still do something like this when I'm 84!\n\nThe story is set immediately after Reign of Terror. The Doctor has brought them to a peaceful, beautiful world to try to rest from their recent adventures. He and Ian go outside to explore while Barbara stays on the Tardis to watch Susan try on various period outfits from the places they've been. Although this might come off as rather dismissive, I think it's a nod to Carole Ann Ford. She wanted Susan to wear different period outfits in the show, but Sydney Newman nixed the idea, wanting to make Susan a more \"normal\" girl that the viewers could connect with.\n\nOutside, the Doctor and Ian begin seeing hazy alien faces. They appear and disappear for only a second, but soon more and more are popping up, accompanied by buildings and other structures. But they're hard to focus on because they disappear so quickly.\n\nThe other part of the story is told from the viewpoint of the aliens, in four different segments. We immediately see that they are existing in a different time flow from the Doctor and Ian. They become known as the \"unmoving ones\" to the aliens and are the basis of their civilization; they learn to build clothes and housing by copying the \"unmoving ones.\" Eventually the civilization reaches advanced technology and ultimately destroys itself via a civil war. The Doctor and Ian see the ruins of the civilization appear before their eyes (including large Tardis-like buildings), and the Doctor realizes what has happened.\n\nThere are some flaws with the story; if one scientist had figured out the \"different time stream\" idea, surely someone else would have done so too, but maybe even if they did know, there was nothing they could do. Were they unable to hurt the Doctor and Ian because of the different time stream? I did enjoy the story though. As a 26 minute narrative you're limited in what you can do, and it felt like a sci-fi story -- in some ways the storytelling style reminded me of \"The Last Question\" by Isaac Asimov (just the style, not the story content). The end reaction of Ian is understandable. You've just been told that an entire civilization rose and fall in front of your eyes, but you couldn't see it. What else can you do but shrug and go back to the Tardis, I guess?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/5rcru3/setsuwa_review_19_rise_and_fall_audio/","subreddit":"gallifrey","subreddit_id":"t5_2tf29","contest_mode":false}

I am 25 now. I'm the heaviest I've ever been and have been essentially recovered from diagnosed anorexia for about 4 years. In hindsight, I did switch obsessions from not eating anything to eating 'safe foods' that were low-carb and high protein, because I started lifting weights regularly. Although my body was healthy, my mind never was.    A few years later when I found out I was pregnant, I ended up developing BED. Which in turn, made me gain an excessive amount of weight in pregnancy. I was so scared to have preggorexia that I wouldn't let my doctor weigh me and just. kept. eating. \n\nI left the hospital 200+ which was a number that made me die inside. \n\nI went through horrible PPD and came out the other side and somehow got my mind healthy by myself. I didn't count calories for months and didn't workout but a few days a week. I expected to lose some of it naturally and had a rude awakening that it wasn't going to happen like that. So over the past year and a few months, I've taken off 30+lbs from a healthy deficient in eating and working out 5+ days a week. \n\nThe last month though I have found myself in those old thoughts. Trying to skip meals, slowly getting to higher deficients. I keep telling myself, \"just restrict until your comfortable and build healthy habits again.\" But I know all to well where that will lead. I am slowly coming back. I keep telling myself, \"today stay under 500\" and I ALWAYS end up eating 1200-1400. Which makes me feel awful. My scale has stopped making its happy descent for FOUR days since the new year and I'm in a full-blown panic. \n\nDid anyone else see the scale plateau when theY started restricting part-time? I'm too fat of a failure to do it full-time, but I still never eat over my deficient. Hoping to build stamina in fasting/restriction as summer is well on its way. \n\nThank you for reading this.

She says it isn't me, its nothing I have done, and I know this but it doesn't help me very much. I know there isn't \"anything i can do\" to change it, and I don't want to. I just need some help on coming to terms with my family being split up and being removed as a very hands on father and being an every other weekend daddy who pays for his kids and doesn't raise them. How do I deal with not making pancakes in the mornings or reading bedtime stories at night? How do I deal with the thought of another woman taking my place on family vacations? How do I come to terms with knowing there will be a time that another woman will be lying in the bed with the woman i love and the kids i adore playing with them the way i do now, and i want to. Please help me. Please give me some sort of advice.. Anyone.. Anything... Thank you.\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Wife told me she is gay. Doesn't love me. Have 2 kids. Can't deal with feelings.

I would say that my issues generally have been mild, though this last year my insomnia worsened considerably. There were three nights I got absolutely zero sleep, and had heart palpitations and went to the ER. They put me on Ativan, which helped me sleep and helped with the panic attacks. Then I saw a primary care doctor (since the psychiatrist I got an appointment with couldn't see me for another couple weeks) who put me on Ambien. The Ambien worked on the third night I tried it, but because I was given a small prescription I tried to stretch it by taking 5mg instead of 10mg, which was not successful. I tried this drink called Neuro Sleep which, along with the Ambien, helped one of the nights. I think the Neuro Sleep only helped because it has Melatonin and I hadn't taken Melatonin as a supplement in maybe a week, though the Melatonin I had been taking (even during those three sleepless nights) in efforts to sleep. I've tried many different dosages of the Melatonin. One of the nights I still had some of the Ambien, I had a Neuro Sleep (3mg Melatonin) and then an extra 6mg, thinking maybe my tolerance to Melatonin was just really high, and that night I think I got maybe 5-6 hours of sleep (which was great, considering I was used to getting much less). I finally saw the psychiatrist about right when the Ambien had run out. He tried to determine if I have bipolar or a hypomania disorder. I know that I have a lot more anxiety than my friends, and I have had periods in my life when I have been very depressed, to the point I have little motivation to work. The last year was especially bad for me, in the motivation department. I am definitely not suicidal, which is good. I've always been a high achiever and have gotten good grades, near the top of my class in college. After graduating and trying to run a company with some friends, living at home, the stress of the political landscape of 2016, a traumatic episode with a sibling almost dying, and some issues with a significant other, kind of brought everything to a head and when I suffered those three sleepless nights. But after the Ativan had run out the first time, I again had around 3-4 sleepless nights, then the Ambien helped, but then as it was running out I had again a series of sleepless nights, which all left me exhausted but unable to actually fall asleep, gave me heart palpitations, and then eventually some small neck and arm pain. \n\nOkay, so then the psychiatrist prescribes me the Seroquel 75mg daily and the Lunesta 3mg. He switched me off of Ambien because one of the nights, a night when I desperately took 15 mg instead of 10mg, I had experienced hearing some slight auditory hallucinations, sort of like people whispering in the background. \n\nSo I have been on the Seroquel and Lunesta for 4 nights. The doctor, sort of strange to me, prescribed the Ativan for my general anxiety to be taken during the day. He made it sound like I should take it if I felt any anxiety at all, not just for big panic attacks. I posted on AskDocs earlier today, and the advice from there was basically just to stop taking the Ativan, as it didn't seem appropriately prescribed. I'll stop taking the Ativan for sure, as I know it's an addictive benzo that has its own problems. But now researching Seroquel, I'm getting quite nervous about being on something like it. I don't know how serious my anxiety issues really are. Though certainly they've been bad enough my whole life to give me frequent, sever insomnia, I've at least been surviving and thriving quite well. The recent insane lack of sleep had me worried for fatal insomnia syndrome for a bit, but because I have been able to dream and sleep deeply with the meds I stopped worrying about that. The Seroquel certainly helps me sleep, but I just worry about all the side affects it has, and I don't know if my mental disorder is serious enough to warrant it. I did feel quite good yesterday, though that could be just from the sleep I made up. I haven't taken the full 75 Seroquel all together yet, the first night I took 25 to see how it made me feel, and it made me feel quite sleepy. But I took it at 8pm and had other activities to do, so then I took the rest of the 50mg later around midnight, waited 20 mins, and then took the Lunesta. Slept for 7 hours straight, woke up, went back to bed for two hours. Last night I tried only taking 25 mg and the Lunesta, couldn't go to sleep, woke up and took another 25mg and an Ativan since I was a bit panicy. I think last night I maybe ended up getting 3 hours of sleep. \n\nSorry, I know this is long winded. I felt like I didn't get much help from AskDocs, and I saw that there were some other Seroquel posts on this sub, and a lot of them are negative. It seems to work for some people for years, to help them sleep at a dose of 50 of 100mg. I guess I'm willing to go ahead and try to get a few weeks of good sleep on the Seroquel, which maybe will make up for the insane lack of sleep for the last month. But the side effects don't sound worth it. And while I do feel anxious often and depressed sometimes-and sometimes the depression is really really bad depending on what is happening career/social wise. But Seroquel sounds like a potentially terrible road to go down. And now I also have that Ativan to worry about, though I think if I stop the Ativan now I won't have any withdrawl problems. I also have bad IBS, controlled with Miralax-been on that for years and years-and asthma, which is controlled well and I'm a pretty decent runner. \n\nWhew. Sorry guys, know that was a long one. I just want to be the happy, healthy, productive 13 year old I used to be. Or even the mostly productive but slightly depressed senior in college. No sleep absolutely sucks, and that does need to be solved somehow. Yes, I have perfect sleep hygiene, have tried chamomile tea, flux on my devices and good computer use rules, separate blackout room for sleeping, all that. I still have yet to go to therapy, just for talking about my issues and starting CBT. I have meditated and practices mindfulness a ton. \n\nI guess, I'm wondering if I should go ahead and use the Seroquel for a bit to just get my sleeping back on track, and then see if I can wean myself off of it while taking care of my other personal problems. Is 50mg or 75mg going to kill me? Last night when I took the 25mg and Lunesta and couldn't sleep, and got out of bed with my heart racing, I am scared even this small dose of Seroquel could due me in since Seroquel is known for sudden cardiac arrest. Part of me wants to try all 75mg at once just to force myself to have a continuous 9+ hours of sleep. But I'm scared I won't wake up. Is that insane?

I want to be full time and not a contractor with this role, so I want to impress them. I want to make that week all about causing them to have secret meetings about me to try to buy out my contract. The interview could not really have gone better. I'm a fu*king idiot but I was really shining that day and they liked my portfolio (I have Reddit to thank, in part, for that) and I clicked with everyone. \n\nHere's what I am worried about... I don't want to recreate history. I've had similar motives before and it can be fatal to one's tenure at the company.\n\nIn my first month at my last company I was given the 'keys to every single safe' at the company. My manager sent me to every meeting instead of him, acted as his proxy because he felt like he could delegate to me... I was invited to every product discussion, offered solutions at most of them, signing up for things that I can do and wouldn't be interviewing let alone talking a hella good ground game about it. I impressed everyone and terrified the small bit of competition I had at that time. If, god forbid, my manager had never had a front end person before and while delegating well that could be a recipe for disaster. One would think, to onesself, \"maybe I should establish a solid rapport with this manager first before I sign up for god damn everyfuckingthing\" but as an idiot I didn't pace myself. The fact is I can do everything I was asked about in that month but not if I was told to do it all concurrently.\n\nThat is exactly what happened. I was so dumb to do what I did, talking the amount I did and showing thought leadership they never knew they needed but once they had were thankful for. I had them convinced I walk on water. I was so, so unspeakably dumb to do what I did. 2 years later I was drowning. Hell I was drowning 3 months into that job.\n\nI know that we (or I) need to appear hungry and fully ready for any challenge especially when new. We need to prove our worth. I know I need to be assertive and professional yet I need to be happily taking on projects &amp; responsibilities. In that month at a previous company I must have signed up for 15 different things, impressing every single person along the way. You betcha I did. And I swan dove right onto my sword and I. bled. out. fullstop.\n\nMonday I start this new job and I need it to go well. I can not make the mistakes I've made in the past. So for you people who are smarter than me and who have found success + long tenures at your employer, how do you handle your first few weeks?\n\nThank you in advance.","archived":false,"id":"5rcx57","num_comments":2,"domain":"self.Frontend","secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Best ways to get off to a good start with a new company?","author":"portmoor","retrieved_on":1489495698,"hidden":false,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1485916850,"thumbnail":"self","spoiler":false,"locked":false,"link_flair_css_class":null}

A warning in advance, this post will likely be quite long and anyone 'triggered' by self harm or suicidal thoughts should stop reading. \n\nI've been depressed since I was 12. It took six years for doctors to actually listen to me and stop treating me like an attention seeking child. Due to my young age, they left me untreated and only offered me questionnaires rather than counselling or medication. Those questionnaires included generic questions where you circled a number between one to ten for your answer. Nothing came of the questionnaires. I became an alcoholic aged 14. I made friends with older people and started acting out. I also started self harming. I got arrested and put on suicide watch. That got me noticed for all of two minutes, with one doctors appointment being given to me to see if my self harming required treatment. It apparently didn't as my cries for help continued to be ignored. I eventually had a mental breakdown in November 2014 where I tried to kill myself in my work place. I slashed at my wrists ready for everything to be over. Unfortunately, the Stanley knife I was using was too blunt to do any real damage. The next day I was put on antidepressants and diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety with social phobia. It took me trying to kill myself for doctors to take me seriously. That was over two years ago. \n\nIn those two years, I have had numerous breakdowns, episodes where I've self harmed, been on the verge of developing an eating disorder and seriously contemplated suicide. \n\nI went to the doctors yesterday due to my medication no longer being effective. I begged my doctor to change my medication or give me something to take as well as. They refused because 'only a psychiatrist' can prescribe additional medication. Instead, they put me on the maximum dosage to see if it would work. It won't. They've basically just left me waiting for the medication to fail again... only then will they change what medication I'm on to something that may actually work. I also mentioned that I qualify for having up to four personality disorders and asked to be put forward to speak to someone so I could potentially get a diagnosis. They refused that too, because 'it doesn't look good on your record'. I don't care how it looks... I want to know exactly what's wrong with me so that I can accept who I am and what I have, so that I can learn to deal with it and find ways to live a 'normal' life based on my needs. That wasn't a valid enough reason, apparently. My medical records appearance shouldn't really be of any concern either as, prior to my asking whether I could get put forward for being diagnosed, my doctor told me they didn't think I would ever be able to go back to working. \n\nAnyway, I also mentioned how, I've been having a constant thought run through my mind - \"If this is going to be my life, what is the point?\". This is due to the fact that I am 21 years old, I've been this 'ill' since I was 18... I got good grades in school and started working towards my degree aged 16. I had prospects. I was going to make something of myself... I was going to make my parents proud of me. Proud that I'd listened to them when I was growing up, and that I'd made the right choices in the end. Proud that I had done things they never did. Proud that I had become a lawyer/doctor/broker/computer genius like they had dreamed. Instead? I'm claiming benefits so that I can afford to pay my bills. I'm living with my mum and sharing a bedroom with my younger sister. My mum has to physically put food in front of me so that I eat because I forget or I have no motivation to actually make something. I have to have someone with me so that I can leave my house. I dropped out of university because I couldn't concentrate and was missing assignments. I have one friend in the entire world because everyone else, even my best friend of 18 years, walked away as soon as I went from bad to worse. In a matter of years, I have gone from having the chance to be somebody and making something of myself, to being an agoraphobic nervous wreck that has nothing to show from their life. The doctors response to my quoting of my thought? \"Oh, dear.\" That is all they said. They didn't care how I felt... they didn't offer any options to help me break this chain of thought. \n\nOnto now. I am fighting the urge to cut myself. I had the same urge last night, although I didn't act upon it. Tonight? I dragged a pair of blunt scissors across my skin to try to quench the urges by providing my body with the sensation of cutting without actually harming myself. It didn't work, and the urges are now stronger than ever. I'm suicidal but not at the same time, if that even makes any sense. I don't want to be here anymore... I don't see the point in living a half life anymore. I'm not living, I'm just alive. I've gone around and around in circles for years, and always ended up right where I started. I want to die... but I also hold onto the hope that one day I'll wake up and I'll live. Actually, live. Whenever I feel like this, I think of my family. My mum, my sister and my brother. My dad, who I don't see as often as I'd like, but love dearly. My grandmother, who is my best friend. She lives abroad, so I don't see her as often as I used to and I don't get to speak to her as often as I'd like either. My pets. I also think of my friend. I think of how my death would affect them... each of them. Individually. My parents would mourn the loss of their eldest child; their baby. My siblings would mourn the loss of their sister, and have to watch our parents grieve me. My pets, whilst they wouldn't grieve as such, would wonder where I was and why I hadn't come home to them. Why I wasn't there to give them their cuddles, or tell them I love them, or play with them. My friend would grieve a friend she had known since primary school, someone who had stood by her when nobody else did, who had supported her in everything. My grandmother? She would grieve her eldest grandchild. Her secret favourite, as she likes to say. She would grieve until the grief eventually took her life. For those reasons, I don't think I could ever go through with killing my self. No matter how bad I get, no matter how hard I try to not think of those reasons and just do it... my mind always goes back to them. \n\nThat is why I am going insane. I am stuck in a constant turmoil of harming myself, wanting to kill myself, realising how killing myself would harm those I love and repeat. I want some form of release from this hell that is my life. I just want my thoughts to shut of for 5 minutes so that I can relax and just feel some peace. My doctor won't refer me to see a psychiatrist as they don't want to 'go down that road'. Instead, they'd rather have me continue living like this, taking medication that doesn't work and suffering. \n\nI sometimes feel like I need to be sectioned. Not for my own safety, but so that I can get the right treatment. Proper treatment. Treatment that will work. Treatment that will teach me a way to live, properly live, and show me the way to recovery. However, my doctor is unwilling to refer me for talk therapy with a counsellor or psychiatrist, let alone order me into a mental health unit. I wouldn't want to check myself into one either, because often, checking yourself in can lead to you not getting proper treatment. \n\nI just feel empty. Like I'm dead inside and just going through the motions, and I can't find a way out. To give a visual on my feelings, imagine there's a body. Inside that body, is hollow apart from a metal frame (much like a robot). You go to the head, and where the brain should be, are controls instead. There's a tube on the side of the skull labelled 'serotonin' which has been blocked off so that the serotonin can't get through the tube. In the back of the skull, is a cage. I'm locked in that cage. Controlling my body? A black figure that appears almost smoke like. It has no face. It's unidentifiable but it's there. It's depression. \n\nI know this is extremely long, and I truly thank anyone that has actually bothered to read through to this point, but this is my cry for help. I need serious advice on how to go forward. How to get my doctors to listen to me. How to get proper treatment. How to get 'better' in a way that allows me to live. Anything. Please. \n\n(I described my life prior to what is happening in the present, so as to show that my illness is true and I have been dealing with it for quite some time. Also to show how I've dealt with it badly and made some terrible decisions that I don't wish to repeat.) \n\n","archived":false,"permalink":"/r/mentalhealth/comments/5rcxcx/im_going_insane/","media":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"suggested_sort":null}
