I am 22, and in September found out I have a brain tumor. I was living 100% independently, 3 hours away from home. Prior to this I only lived with my mom, but would occasionally stay with my dad. \nSo the tumor happened and I had to move back home, due to safety reasons, and hospital appointments. I ended up staying back and forth between both of my parents houses. \nMy dad was a bit over bearing at first, but for over it more after a few weeks. But it was still a huge change and that was making it a bit harder. \nSo fast forward about a week before Christmas, I was about to finish my radiation treatments, and was weening off my medicines. My dad kept talking about how I will be able to control my schedule more, and decide where I stay after these appointments were over, and I was very much looking forward to that as my dad lives out in the country, the closest store is a farmers market and hour walk away; and I can\u2019t drive at the moment. \nSo the day before my last appointment, I had a seizure. I don\u2019t remember any of it, or was mild, and I am perfectly fine now, they just decided we need to ween off my medicines a bit slower. Now my dad on the other hand is on full overbearing mode again. Which I get it, he was the one who saw me and had to call 911. But it\u2019s just so much for example he already planned for me to be at his house 4 days next week without really asking me. I just want to be able to have some freedom.

Any naivete in this is probably because of us being teenagers.  \n \n\nAnyway, my boyfriend and I had been together for 9 months. He was my first boyfriend and very sweet. He sat with me and my friends at our lunch table because, according to him, his friends all branched out and left at his table one by one until he was sitting there alone. We bonded pretty quickly.  \n \n\nHe left to become a marine in August, and all throughout his training I was his cheerleader. I encouraged him and made sure to let him know i couldn't wait until he got back. He wrote me letters and I wrote back, and he told me how good it was to hear from me. \"It kept him going,\" he said.  \n \n\nHe graduated and got back this month. He got back to our town and was staying with his sister who lives just down the street from me, so he walked over and stayed for about an hour, watching Netflix and talking to me just like he did before he left. Eventually he has to go and we hug and say our goodbyes. All was fine at first, if a little slow, and I get the feeling he's not as into me as he was before he left. I ask my friend about it (who was his friend long before we met) and she said he talked to her and told her he felt I wasn't into him anymore. So I messaged him on Instagram (he was staying with his folks in DFW, I live in a small town about 3 hours away) and tried to talk him up, trying to lead up to reminding him I love him and I'm proud of him. He's giving one word, uninterested responses. I ask what's wrong, and he has a bit of an episode, telling me I've barely talked to him since he got back. This left me... jarred, to say the least, since last we texted he left ME on read and hadnt gotten in touch since. The conversation kind of drops off until a few days later, when he texts me again and just... This exchange still baffles me.  \n \n\n\"Hey\"  \n \n\n\"Yo\"  \n \n\n\"Is that all I'm worth. A simple yo\"  \n \n\n\"No\"  \n \n\n\"Ight\"  \n \n\nI'm kind of pissed at this point. I tell him I dont know what's been going on with him lately, but if he wants to talk, awesome, but if he's just going to act pissy and weird to please leave me alone and let me recover. \"Oop. Goodnight then\"  \n \n\nA few more days pass and I text him, apologizing for talking to him that way and admitting I lost my patience when he seems to need my support the most. He responds with \"it's whatever. It just be like that.\" Dismissive and kind of rude, but whatever, this isn't about me. We kind of manage to talk normally until he jokes about me giving my sister IT (intensive training?) for playing Skyrim strangely and calling me a subordinate as a \"joke.\" I got pissed at this as he knows how much I value being equals in a relationship, as well as that he's trying to invalidate my feelings with a joke when the day before he left for marine training we got into an argument over me poking fun at him about his penis size (he was doing it to himself as self deprecation first and I jumped on thinking it was okay)and him half-seriously calling me fat in return, which ended with me apologizing in depth and saying I should be more empathetic to his feelings, while he never even really directly apologized to me for his slight. I remind him of this incident and he blows me off, basically calling the circumstances different. After a while of feeling like he hasnt cared since he returned, I confront him and ask him straight up: do you care about me anymore?  \n \n\nHe replies that his training has made him numb to just about everything (\"except cats and taco bell.\" What the fuck?). That answer isnt as straight an answer as my question so I ask him to clarify, is he numb to me, too? Yes, he says. Did he ever care about me? \"Of course :(\", he says. At the time it was a small comfort, but I'm not even sure if he was being honest despite my pleas for him to be. It hurts, but I decide that sticking around with someone I loved while getting \"numbness\" in return wasnt worth it. I want to give him a piece of my mind and call him every name in the book, but I like to think I have more grace than that. I restrained myself and told him I hope whatever the marines broke in him gets fixed soon, and I thank him for being my friend while he could.  \n \n\nMy grandm and mom were quite fond of my boyfriend despite barely ever interacting with him, so when they next bring him up and I tell them I broke up with him, they tell me how sorry they are for me, how it's normal to be sad. I regret it now, but I acted strong in front of them and insisted I broke up with him with no heartbreak or trouble. I vaguely told them he was acting like a dick, and thankfully they didnt prod for more info, or else I might have broken down right then and there.  \n \n\nMy family, my friends, they all see me as so strong, and I've moved on fairly okay, but it still bothers me. I miss the old him, the him that traded memes and discussed video games with me. I miss going to the movies and holding his hand. I miss the him I made a birthday cake for. I recently found he blocked me on Instagram, and when I asked my friend if she and her still talked just fine, she said they talk like he never left. What gives then? I kind of want to tell her not to talk to him anymore, but I know that's just me being petty. I dont really know a good way to end this other than saying yes, I'm aware that lots of this sounds overdramatic and ridiculous, but it still hurts me. I was just so tired of acting above it with my friends and family, I needed to get this out somehow. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my rant! I hope I can move on and start 2020 with a clean slate now!

I believe the example--at least one of them--was used with how we might play with toy cars in spinning the wheels to see how it works.\n\nI decided to share this with one of the groups on Facebook, and added in a particular experience of my own...\n\nIt reminded me of an experience I had when I was in preschool:\n\nso...they took us on a field trip to some magic show place; I couldn't for the life of me tell you what it was called to this day. Almost 35 years ago, and trust me it did not stick out in my memory...although one particular moment does, and I've even recounted this moment to people as far back as 2 decades ago....\n\nSo they're doing the magic show, and I'm as \"excited as ever\" watching the guy on stage doing whatever he's doing; I'm of course far more focused on the layout of the whole place, and then I notice what looks like an arm attached to the wall on the right. The arm is holding a wand. AT one point in the show, the arm moves, signifying a \"magic spell\" being cast or something.\n\nI remember after the show, I kept staring at that arm, and my peers came over to me, and asked what the hell I was staring at it for. I tried explaining I was trying to figure out how it moved and all that (I'm 4, so shut the hell up).\n\nThey...looked at me like I was completely insane, and just went off to continue chatting it up with each other.\n\nI bring this up cause it reminds me of something someone posted here when I shared about my understanding now about myself with my family over the years, and the failure to nurture me properly.\n\nSomeone here posted \"you have wisdom...wisdom your family clearly lacks\". Well...I think one of the biggest problems is we have wisdom \\*most\\* people lack, and therefore have failed thus far to nurture us properly.\n\nTHAT'S why it appears we need so much help later in life.\n\nWe're requested to fall in line and just blend in; the world wasn't ready yet for people who would take note of these things earlier in life, and how to nurture them, the way we'd need to be.\n\nAnyway, after I mentioned that, I decided to discuss it with a former coworker of mine who I refer to as my \"sensei\". Yes, she's an older Asian women; amazingly brilliant, I can assure you!\n\nShe started asking me questions about why I enjoy what I enjoy; and let me tell you...the way she asked the questions...is something I don't commonly get from others; essentially presenting everything from a different perspective; you know how we crave hearing a new fascinating perspective to query.\n\nShe came up with an excellent question to push me to articulate why I approve of what I do in the fandoms that I do, and whatnot.\n\nLike...why I get so bored at these live shows and wind up paying attention to other things, etc. She used Ghostbusters, as an example.\n\nHere's how I can best describe it, for myself:\n\nseeing an act performed of and by itself is fine....but...I want to know what that act will be used to do in the long run, not simply \"oh, hey, somebody did that act\"\n\nTake the Mission Impossible series; each act performed by the members of the team is kinda cool, but it's not each act being performed that pulls you in...it's how they use their resourcefulness with each act to serve a greater purpose on a larger scale, if that makes sense.\n\nThat magic show I saw...um...fine? Now...how can that act be used on a grander scale than some mere parlor tricks to keep the kids quiet for more than 5 minutes? THAT'S where you've pulled me in...and maybe that's what it's always really come down to for me that neither has anyone genuinely understood, nor until now have I been really able to articulate and explain.\n\nSomeone responded to my post on Facebook with the greatest conceivable comment imaginable:\n\n\" you like complexity that also has function. like a grandfather clock, a ticking sound with some gears isnt what makes a person like those-its how all of it goes together. or why i like cars and mechanical engineering. i like levers sure but their boring, use a lever to flip a switch and add in other components that align and function-like how a solar system seems to be a dance through the sky and requires all bodys to be in sync to work and i can watch that forever. \"\n\nThe entire reason I bring this up is....did I likely know all this deep down since I was 4? Yes, but for those 33 years since, for the life of me I just never knew exactly how to articulate all of this, until now.\n\nThis I believe is part of the problem that people have in trying to reach us; I feel they're only really doing it from an area of extremely limited understanding of how our minds work now; i.e. just hoping that something--anything--from the \"established\" way will get thru, and it won't.\n\nThe thing is...when they're willing to put the effort into attempting it from a different angle, the results may be some of the most incredible they could have ever asked for; everything they never even knew they wanted that their non-Autistic ilk likely would've never provided on such a degree.\n\nBut doing that takes work, and approaching it differently. I'm glad I finally came to this understanding, and I'm hoping that it may inspire others now too.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Autistic","subreddit_id":"t5_2ujlz","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Autistic","subreddit_subscribers":7081,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Weekend of Revelations Part 2","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autistic\/comments\/eib2xb\/weekend_of_revelations_part_2\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I believe the example--at least one of them--was used with how we might play with toy cars in spinning the wheels to see how it works.\n\nI decided to share this with one of the groups on Facebook, and added in a particular experience of my own...\n\nIt reminded me of an experience I had when I was in preschool:\n\nso...they took us on a field trip to some magic show place; I couldn't for the life of me tell you what it was called to this day. Almost 35 years ago, and trust me it did not stick out in my memory...although one particular moment does, and I've even recounted this moment to people as far back as 2 decades ago....\n\nSo they're doing the magic show, and I'm as \"excited as ever\" watching the guy on stage doing whatever he's doing; I'm of course far more focused on the layout of the whole place, and then I notice what looks like an arm attached to the wall on the right. The arm is holding a wand. AT one point in the show, the arm moves, signifying a \"magic spell\" being cast or something.\n\nI remember after the show, I kept staring at that arm, and my peers came over to me, and asked what the hell I was staring at it for. I tried explaining I was trying to figure out how it moved and all that (I'm 4, so shut the hell up).\n\nThey...looked at me like I was completely insane, and just went off to continue chatting it up with each other.\n\nI bring this up cause it reminds me of something someone posted here when I shared about my understanding now about myself with my family over the years, and the failure to nurture me properly.\n\nSomeone here posted \"you have wisdom...wisdom your family clearly lacks\". Well...I think one of the biggest problems is we have wisdom \\*most\\* people lack, and therefore have failed thus far to nurture us properly.\n\nTHAT'S why it appears we need so much help later in life.\n\nWe're requested to fall in line and just blend in; the world wasn't ready yet for people who would take note of these things earlier in life, and how to nurture them, the way we'd need to be.\n\nAnyway, after I mentioned that, I decided to discuss it with a former coworker of mine who I refer to as my \"sensei\". Yes, she's an older Asian women; amazingly brilliant, I can assure you!\n\nShe started asking me questions about why I enjoy what I enjoy; and let me tell you...the way she asked the questions...is something I don't commonly get from others; essentially presenting everything from a different perspective; you know how we crave hearing a new fascinating perspective to query.\n\nShe came up with an excellent question to push me to articulate why I approve of what I do in the fandoms that I do, and whatnot.\n\nLike...why I get so bored at these live shows and wind up paying attention to other things, etc. She used Ghostbusters, as an example.\n\nHere's how I can best describe it, for myself:\n\nseeing an act performed of and by itself is fine....but...I want to know what that act will be used to do in the long run, not simply \"oh, hey, somebody did that act\"\n\nTake the Mission Impossible series; each act performed by the members of the team is kinda cool, but it's not each act being performed that pulls you in...it's how they use their resourcefulness with each act to serve a greater purpose on a larger scale, if that makes sense.\n\nThat magic show I saw...um...fine? Now...how can that act be used on a grander scale than some mere parlor tricks to keep the kids quiet for more than 5 minutes? THAT'S where you've pulled me in...and maybe that's what it's always really come down to for me that neither has anyone genuinely understood, nor until now have I been really able to articulate and explain.\n\nSomeone responded to my post on Facebook with the greatest conceivable comment imaginable:\n\n\" you like complexity that also has function. like a grandfather clock, a ticking sound with some gears isnt what makes a person like those-its how all of it goes together. or why i like cars and mechanical engineering. i like levers sure but their boring, use a lever to flip a switch and add in other components that align and function-like how a solar system seems to be a dance through the sky and requires all bodys to be in sync to work and i can watch that forever. \"\n\nThe entire reason I bring this up is....did I likely know all this deep down since I was 4? Yes, but for those 33 years since, for the life of me I just never knew exactly how to articulate all of this, until now.\n\nThis I believe is part of the problem that people have in trying to reach us; I feel they're only really doing it from an area of extremely limited understanding of how our minds work now; i.e. just hoping that something--anything--from the \"established\" way will get thru, and it won't.\n\nThe thing is...when they're willing to put the effort into attempting it from a different angle, the results may be some of the most incredible they could have ever asked for; everything they never even knew they wanted that their non-Autistic ilk likely would've never provided on such a degree.\n\nBut doing that takes work, and approaching it differently. I'm glad I finally came to this understanding, and I'm hoping that it may inspire others now too.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AutisticAdults","subreddit_id":"t5_2zf7w","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AutisticAdults","subreddit_subscribers":3105,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Weekend of Revelations Part 2","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AutisticAdults\/comments\/eib37n\/weekend_of_revelations_part_2\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

If I ignore the Tac-22 ammo that it didn't like, it shot 4\/13 groups sub MOA and if I look at tight groups with only a single flier, it's 6\/13 and 11\/13 that are better than 1.3 MOA. I did not expect that level of precision out of pretty basic factory ammo (Federal AutoMatch, CCI Standard, and CCI Mini Mags).\n\nIt'll be very interesting to keep logging data as well as to see how the same stuff performs at 100 yards where I'd expect CCI Standard to do better than the supersonic varieties, but who knows.\n\n**How'd the rifle do**\n\nI love this rifle with or without the suppressor. With the suppressor and subsonic ammo, it sounds like shooting a BB gun. My range buddy said from behind it sounded like (with ears on) a rubber band gun. With supersonic ammo, you don't hear the rifle cycle at all, just the initial (quieter) crack and the ricochet from behind the target. The trigger is super crisp. The stock actually fits me. The glass is way overkill for 50 to 100 yards but really nice to have for how inexpensive it is. I could have got better rings, but these work fine for now. The standard spring in the bolt seems to work well and I only had any ammo ejection or feed issues with the Tac-22 ammo.\n\nEverything just works together beautifully (for me) with this. And the whole rifle is 6.6 lbs. A sight better than the 9.5 lbs when I had similar equipment on the Ruger Target rifle. It's balanced just in front of the trigger, making it pretty easy to keep on target when standing or kneeling, especially with the sling (where the Ruger Target was very barrel heavy and had me drifting quite a bit more). I don't need weight in a 10\/22 other than enough to dampen any jitters. The stock is just barely adjustable enough to get me a good cheek weld and enough LOP, but it *is* adjustable enough for that (I'm 5'11\", but I guess I have non-standard arms and neck lengths), so I'm far more solid than on a standard 10\/22. The bolt is smooth ... still has the normal hitch about halfway down where you feel some resistance as the rod moves slightly, but I don't know how correctable that is in this configuration of bolt.\n\n**Method**\n\nSo I put this together over time, but the action, bolt, barrel, and suppressor are new parts as of this last week and I got to put the first roughly 100 rounds through it today. The first 15 or so just to sight it in at 25 yards, but boy, those were tight as well right off the bat (I didn't include them since it was only 25 yards and hard to measure well, but they were CCI Standards and were 1.01 to 1.29 MOA).\n\nI shot  two 5 round groups at a target 50 yards away with various kinds of ammo and with the suppressor on and off for all types. I'll definitely be repeating this test multiple times and also at 100 yards. I used a bipod and shot from a bench, but no rear bag (probably would have been a better test of the ammo, but less fun and less a test of me and my rifle together).\n\nAmmo choices were dictated by what I had, but pretty common selections for most folks, depending what you're doing. CCI Standard and Mini Mag are everywhere and are kind of the standard shooters and plinkers. Federal AutoMatch is, from what I understand, their bulk batch of their HV Match, and has generally been *pretty ok*. Comparable (to me) to CCI Mini Mags, and sometimes a lot cheaper. Norma Tac-22 is supposed to be a higher end subsonic, and I've had great success with it depending on the rifle or pistol. My Ruger Standard liked it a lot and my Ruger 10\/22 Target (before I had this rifle) liked it pretty well, so I have a bunch of it.\n\nI shot the first sets without the suppressor, then added it and re-shot the same groups with the suppressor (\"Q\" after the ammo type is with the Q El Camino on that group). Here's the straight results in the order I shot them. The entries with \"\\*\\*\" on them are where I had a really tight group with a single flier, so I listed the tight group's MOA as well. The CCI Standard entry with the \"###\" should honestly have been discounted since it was the first 5 shots out of the suppressor\n\n**Results**\n\n|**Ammo (Q=Supp)**|**Inches**|**MOA**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|CCI Standard|0.66|1.26|\n|CCI Standard|0.52|0.99|\n|Tac 22|0.59|1.13|\n|Tac 22|0.59|1.13|\n|CCI Mini Mag \\*\\*|0.89 (0.35)|1.70 (0.67)|\n|CCI Mini Mag|0.96|1.83|\n|CCI Mini Mag|0.65|1.24|\n|Federal AutoMatch|0.82|1.57|\n|Federal AutoMatch|0.3|0.57|\n|CCI Standard Q|0.58|1.11|\n|CCI Standard Q|0.65|1.24|\n|Tac 22 Q|1.38|2.64|\n|Tac 22 Q|0.9|1.72|\n|CCI Mini Mag Q|0.43|0.82|\n|CCI Mini Mag Q \\*\\*|0.46 (0.28)|0.88 (0.53)|\n|Federal AutoMatch Q|0.64|1.22|\n|Federal AutoMatch Q \\*\\*|0.59 (0.27)|1.13 (0.51)|\n\nAnd here's the results in order of best MOA to worst MOA.\n\n|Ammo (Q=Supp)|Inches|MOA|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Federal AutoMatch|0.3|0.57|\n|CCI Mini Mag Q|0.43|0.82|\n|CCI Mini Mag Q \\*\\*|0.46 (0.28)|0.88 (0.53)|\n|CCI Standard|0.52|0.99|\n|CCI Standard Q|0.58|1.11|\n|Tac 22|0.59|1.13|\n|Tac 22|0.59|1.13|\n|Federal AutoMatch Q \\*\\*|0.59 (0.27)|1.13 (0.51)|\n|Federal AutoMatch Q|0.64|1.22|\n|CCI Mini Mag|0.65|1.24|\n|CCI Standard Q|0.65|1.24|\n|CCI Standard|0.66|1.26|\n|Federal AutoMatch|0.82|1.57|\n|CCI Mini Mag \\*\\*|0.89 (0.35)|1.70 (0.67)|\n|Tac 22 Q|0.9|1.72|\n|CCI Mini Mag|0.96|1.83|\n|Tac 22 Q|1.38|2.64\u200b|\n\nNow, before we judge most of these ammo results, this is just *four* 5 shot groups (2 suppressed). *Yes, I shot an almost 1\/2 MOA group with Federal AutoMatch out of a 16.5\" barrel. And yes, that's super exciting. But statistical anomalies are going to anomaly.* I would definitely need more data before saying anything really conclusive about any ammo.\n\nBut it was awesomely fun to get those results regardless :)\n\nThat said, before, with my admittedly pretty solid 10\/22 Target edition, I was shooting roughly 2MOA consistently. This rifle (and me), minus a couple slip ups from me, seems more than capable of *sustaining* at least 1.2 MOA, and it seems more than likely I've got something quite capable of sub-MOA results if I can pull it together. I hit 4\/17 groups sub-MOA legitimately, and, if allowing for a single flier in an otherwise tight group, look like I could have hit 6\/17.\n\nSomething interesting to me was that the suppressor *hated* the Tac-22 ammo. It spread out dramatically compared to  the fairly tight and virtually identical groups without the suppressor. It was also the only ammo that had any feeding problems. Once per ten round mag, it failed to cycle fully (bolt didn't close completely). And conversely, the suppressor *loved* the CCI Mini Mags. It tightened those right up.\n\nThe CCI Standard was pretty consistent, but the CCI Mini Mag seems to be the likely winner so far, but again, we'll see when I have time to go out to 100 yards.\n\nI'm not planning to try any ELD or Wolf or anything. I mean sure, I spent a good amount on building this rifle, but I just can't get over spending that much per round on 22 ammo. Maybe some day when I feel I've dialed everything else in just a little more, I'll try a box just to see, but not any time soon. In the mean time, I have some Federal Gold Medal Match \/ HV Match, some Winchester Wildcats, some Blazers, and some Aguila Super Extra I'll try as well, though I expect from previous history all of them to be less consistent than the basic CCI ammo.\n\nI do like gathering the data, though! That's always a good afternoon.\n\nEdit: I added some of the sub-MOA groups to the imgur both for confirmation and to re-measure :)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"1022","subreddit_id":"t5_2v7cn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/1022","subreddit_subscribers":12631,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"First 100 rounds with new Kidd rifle","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/1022\/comments\/eib6by\/first_100_rounds_with_new_kidd_rifle\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

We were best friends for a few months then things took a relationship turn when we got \u201cdown and dirty\u201d at her house one day kinda out of the blue. You could just tell we both instantly fell in love, it was the most intimate sex i\u2019ve ever had. Like cupid himself shot a arrow so far up my ass it hit my brain and I went on autopilot. This happened not too long after her previous BF cheated on her and she broke up with him. Also very shortly after my previous \u201cThing\u201d with someone ended because she wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship (she then started dating an abusive drug addict so I think that was for the best) And me and \u201cAmanda\u201d had been helping each other with each of our \u201cproblematic\u201d relationships so we grew a great bond over expressing our feelings and we just clicked. Fast forward back to the day we had sex for the first time. And within 3 weeks we were officially BF and GF. This has been the best relationship Ive ever been in in my entire life. We fell in love, REALLY in love, talked about moving to Vegas since we are both graduating this year. She talked about having kids, getting married, the whole shabang. We have never fought or had problems, relationship was strong, and our communication was perfect......until the last month. She became suddenly distant. Wasn\u2019t talking to me as much, hanging out with friends and not inviting me, not really telling me what she was doing she was always just \u201cbusy.\u201d Then a week and a half ago she gives me the \u201cwe need to talk\u201d text. And I was extremely confused. saying \u201coh there is no way she is gonna break up with me she wants to move to Vegas get married and have kids we have everything planned out, were gonna move to idaho and montana and explore the world together.\u201d And then she tells me she \u201clost interest\u201d and doesn\u2019t see anything in the relationship anymore. Im shocked. Why didn\u2019t she talk to me about this? we always tell each other if there is a problem and 100% of the time when we talked about something it got resolved so I cant understand why she held this in for so long to the point where she broke down and broke up with me. We had one last kiss that she said \u201cshe shouldn\u2019t have done\u201d and said she needed space and to not talk to her and it was over. So there I am  a week after the breakup, classic depressed in my room at 3 in the morning listening to my favorite \u201cI feel like im dying\u201d songs. When I get a text. Its from her. She wants to come over to my house tomorrow on christmas. (my dad wont be home that day and she knew that) So I say sure thinking she just wants to talk or something and stop by. And then she had sex with me. Within 20 minutes walking in the door. BOOM it happened. She left later that night and I was in deep thought realizing wtf just happened. She came over the next day, we had sex twice this time. I went to her house the day after and yes you guessed it. We had sex again. And here I am 3 days after that and I feel so empty. I feel amazing when im there with her like she wants to get back together. But then she ignores my texts and lies that she isn\u2019t home when I know she is. I feel so.....dead. At this point I feel like the only thing I can do is tell her that we can either get back together and fix whatever was wrong (if she would tell me) or we just cant be in each others lives anymore and i need to end it. She still wants to be \u201cfriends\u201d but she also wants to have sex. I love her more that you could imagine and yes I would love to keep having sex but I want our honest relationship back and doing what were doing is hurting me while not being together.

Any naivete in this is probably because of us being teenagers.  \n \n\nAnyway, my boyfriend and I had been together for 9 months. He was my first boyfriend and very sweet. He sat with me and my friends at our lunch table because, according to him, his friends all branched out and left at his table one by one until he was sitting there alone. We bonded pretty quickly.  \n \n\nHe left to become a marine in August, and all throughout his training I was his cheerleader. I encouraged him and made sure to let him know i couldn't wait until he got back. He wrote me letters and I wrote back, and he told me how good it was to hear from me. \"It kept him going,\" he said.  \n \n\nHe graduated and got back this month. He got back to our town and was staying with his sister who lives just down the street from me, so he walked over and stayed for about an hour, watching Netflix and talking to me just like he did before he left. Eventually he has to go and we hug and say our goodbyes. All was fine at first, if a little slow, and I get the feeling he's not as into me as he was before he left. I ask my friend about it (who was his friend long before we met) and she said he talked to her and told her he felt I wasn't into him anymore. So I messaged him on Instagram (he was staying with his folks in DFW, I live in a small town about 3 hours away) and tried to talk him up, trying to lead up to reminding him I love him and I'm proud of him. He's giving one word, uninterested responses. I ask what's wrong, and he has a bit of an episode, telling me I've barely talked to him since he got back. This left me... jarred, to say the least, since last we texted he left ME on read and hadnt gotten in touch since. The conversation kind of drops off until a few days later, when he texts me again and just... This exchange still baffles me.  \n \n\n\"Hey\"  \n \n\n\"Yo\"  \n \n\n\"Is that all I'm worth. A simple yo\"  \n \n\n\"No\"  \n \n\n\"Ight\"  \n \n\nI'm kind of pissed at this point. I tell him I dont know what's been going on with him lately, but if he wants to talk, awesome, but if he's just going to act pissy and weird to please leave me alone and let me recover. \"Oop. Goodnight then\"  \n \n\nA few more days pass and I text him, apologizing for talking to him that way and admitting I lost my patience when he seems to need my support the most. He responds with \"it's whatever. It just be like that.\" Dismissive and kind of rude, but whatever, this isn't about me. We kind of manage to talk normally until he jokes about me giving my sister IT (intensive training?) for playing Skyrim strangely and calling me a subordinate as a \"joke.\" I got pissed at this as he knows how much I value being equals in a relationship, as well as that he's trying to invalidate my feelings with a joke when the day before he left for marine training we got into an argument over me poking fun at him about his penis size (he was doing it to himself as self deprecation first and I jumped on thinking it was okay)and him half-seriously calling me fat in return, which ended with me apologizing in depth and saying I should be more empathetic to his feelings, while he never even really directly apologized to me for his slight. I remind him of this incident and he blows me off, basically calling the circumstances different. After a while of feeling like he hasnt cared since he returned, I confront him and ask him straight up: do you care about me anymore?  \n \n\nHe replies that his training has made him numb to just about everything (\"except cats and taco bell.\" What the fuck?). That answer isnt as straight an answer as my question so I ask him to clarify, is he numb to me, too? Yes, he says. Did he ever care about me? \"Of course :(\", he says. At the time it was a small comfort, but I'm not even sure if he was being honest despite my pleas for him to be. It hurts, but I decide that sticking around with someone I loved while getting \"numbness\" in return wasnt worth it. I want to give him a piece of my mind and call him every name in the book, but I like to think I have more grace than that. I restrained myself and told him I hope whatever the marines broke in him gets fixed soon, and I thank him for being my friend while he could.  \n \n\nMy grandm and mom were quite fond of my boyfriend despite barely ever interacting with him, so when they next bring him up and I tell them I broke up with him, they tell me how sorry they are for me, how it's normal to be sad. I regret it now, but I acted strong in front of them and insisted I broke up with him with no heartbreak or trouble. I vaguely told them he was acting like a dick, and thankfully they didnt prod for more info, or else I might have broken down right then and there.  \n \n\nMy family, my friends, they all see me as so strong, and I've moved on fairly okay, but it still bothers me. I miss the old him, the him that traded memes and discussed video games with me. I miss going to the movies and holding his hand. I miss the him I made a birthday cake for. I recently found he blocked me on Instagram, and when I asked my friend if she and her still talked just fine, she said they talk like he never left. What gives then? I kind of want to tell her not to talk to him anymore, but I know that's just me being petty. I dont really know a good way to end this other than saying yes, I'm aware that lots of this sounds overdramatic and ridiculous, but it still hurts me. I was just so tired of acting above it with my friends and family, I needed to get this out somehow. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my rant! I hope I can move on and start 2020 with a clean slate now!

Does that mean it is? \n\nNow for background\nA slight preface: I'm 22 and I just got out of a long term five year relationship that ended due to being about 80% my fault. I have spent the last five months doing a lot of introspection and working on the things that my ex pointed out led to our failed relationship that I believe were genuinely true. I am finally feeling a lot better about myself as a potential romantic partner due to all of this. \nI've been speaking with and spending a large amount of time with a particular female for a little over a month now. Ive been very open about my feelings for what I want in a relationship, my mental health issues I'm overcoming, and what kind of life I'm seeking for myself and my eventual family. I've been honest about my quirky interests and generally just been very openly me. Usually I temper my personally as most people don't mesh well with the real me, but I decided fuck it, I don't want any pretense anymore when it comes to meeting people. She has seen no issue in any of this. She has repeatedly told me she's very much okay with me being a work in progress, she shares many of my quirky interests(particular genre of reading, D&amp;D, artistic endeavors, etc). She says I make her happy when she's around me. She feels comfortable and safe around me which she doesn't normally with most people. She looks at me like I'm the only person in a room, and it makes me feel that way. She listens and makes an effort. I have no idea why I can't just be happy with his and why I'm anxious due to it.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"love","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhnh","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/love","subreddit_subscribers":110970,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"It seems too good to be true, does that mean it is?","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/love\/comments\/eibk7w\/it_seems_too_good_to_be_true_does_that_mean_it_is\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

To set the scene, I'm 24 and my Mum is nearly 60. She's a textbook narcissist - obsessive to the tee and demanding all the same. When I was small (5), she left my Dad and my brother of 15 years old to go and live abroad. She didn't return until I was 18 and expects everything to be completely normal and hunky dory. To say our relationship is strained is a massive understatement.\n\nThis year I couldn't spend Christmas with her - my O\/H had a rough year and lost someone central in his family. It's been rough and this is the first Christmas after that, so I chose to be with him. I told her that I'd be with her in-between Christmas and New Year instead to keep things sweet.\n\nEven still, I went to see her on Christmas morning to drop off her present. It was something I'd put considerable thought into and thought she would really like, but she opened it and told me that she wouldn't use it. So I went to the trouble to explain what it is, how to use it, what it's for, why I'd bought it - but still, she says she wouldn't ever use it. Instead she asks me to return it instead. It really upset me, not just because it's hurtful to put such effort into something only to have it completely cast aside, but also because she's always told me her mother did the same to her and that she'd never to the same to her children. It's incredibly upsetting and frustrating to say the least. We eventually had a phone call after where I told her how I felt and how upset I was, but she didn't understand and just flipped it round on me saying that I thought she was a 'Shit Mum' for how she behaved. This was after I spoke to multiple other people to see what they thought of the whole situation, only to hear that they thought it was absolutely awful for her to throw the gift back in my face.\n\nSo after all this, I decided I wouldn't spend Boxing Day with her nor New Years or any time in-between. I thought she didn't deserve my company if that's how she would treat me - this was after she had to spend Christmas with friends because she's pushed literally everyone else in her family away from her.\n\nI know it wasn't the nicest thing to do, but she doesn't respect me or my feelings. I know this time of year is a time for family but when they treat you like this I really don't think it's an obligation. She might be my mother, but she acts anything but. It's been a bit of a final straw, and I don't want to feel beholden to her.\n\nTL;DR - AMITA if I don't see my Mum over Christmas because she's been intentionally rude and callous?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AmItheAsshole","subreddit_subscribers":1870850,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA if I ditch my Mum over christmas for being nasty?","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/eibtrs\/aita_if_i_ditch_my_mum_over_christmas_for_being\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

This is super unusual for me because I'm definitely not one to put myself out like this. But for the last 10 years I had a tradition with my old friends from grade school where we would spend New Years together. For one reason or another, I lost all of those friends over this year and therefore it's my first New Years by myself and I'm having a bit of a hard time with it. \n\nBut enough of the sad stuff! Let me tell you a bit about me so you can determine if you want to tell me a bit about you! \n\nLike I said in the title, I'm 20 years old and I live in the Midwest trapped in the boring suburbs. My main hobby is playing video games: PS4, Switch, and PC but I only have multiplayer for PC. Lately I've been playing a TON of Monster Hunter World in preparation for the Iceborne expansion on PC. I've also been playing a ton of Spyro Reignited Trilogy, the new God of War, and Jurassic World Evolution. Maybe you'd be interested in hunting a monster or two with me? :D \n\nI'm into stuff that isn't video games though. I often have YouTube running in the background of my life and I'm always looking for new suggestions! I also have been watching shows from my childhood on Disney+ (Suite Life of Zach and Cody still holds up do not @ me on this). \n\nI'm gonna combine two of my interests into one since they're kinda hand in hand for me. My second biggest hobby is DnD though I never get to play. I've been working on my own Homebrew fantasy setting which I think is *really* cool and I love working on. As a result, I also consider myself a bit of an amateur writer\/author, with one of my major aspirations being to write and publish a novel someday! I've been told that my writing is *really* good, and I'd like to think that's true! \n\nAs for miscellaneous likes that I have, I'm a passive fan of anime but it's not something I watch frequently due to me not having a VRV\/Crunchyroll sub. I also like movies, especially the Marvel movies (we can't all have unique movie tastes!) and TV shows, especially sitcoms since that's easily digestible and like I said I watch stuff more in the background. And if it's your cup of tea, I also dabble in RP here and there. \n\nOther than my interests, I'd like to think I'm an enjoyable person to talk to. Though I will say out of the game I'm more of the calm and quiet type as a default state, but that definitely does *not* mean I won't get pumped up if the situation calls for it. I'm a fan of both casual chitchat and heavy philosophical conversation, so you can throw whatever you have at me. It takes a lot to catch me off guard. I've seen it all, people! \n\nSo, yeah, I think that sums me up at least a little bit.  I don't have anything going on tonight so you can expect at least semi-quick replies. I have Discord (most used), Steam, and a bunch of misc. messaging apps that we can talk on, or we can just use Reddit! (Though, I will say I have had little luck in Reddit's messaging system working for me so it's not preferable)\n\nI hope to hear from some cool people! Even if you don't think you're cool, I probably will :D\n\nEdit: Wow I just realized how long this is.

Now, all females in my family are small, like, small small. I am only 5'2 and I was taller then my mother, my Nan and my grandmother. The males are lucky and obvious take all the tall genes my family has. But I also have a baby face and there are plenty of times where no one has belived my actual age cause I look younger, and my choice of clothes don't help at all.\n\nThis happened one morning, and just my luck that both my brother and Great uncle were out. So, when there was a knock at the door I answered. There was a guy, he was going around house to house with a card about cleaning driveways. Now, the house I stay in away from Uni is actually in the joint tenacy of me and my Great Uncle. That is a completely different story. But he took one look at me and his first words wasn't even a greeting.\n\nGuy: The advertising guy\n\nMe: Me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGuy: Are you're parents home?\n\nMe: I am 21, how can I help you?\n\nHe gives me a odd look, and sort of looks amused.\n\nGuy: You're joking\n\nMe: Nope, I am 21.\n\nGuy: You don't look that age.\n\nMe: I know, I get it alot.\n\nGuy: Well, I can't be too careful. Is there anyone else living here?\n\nMe: My Great uncle, but he's out and my brother.\n\nGuy: Is your brother in?\n\nMe: He's two years younger then me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I think he realised that I was the oldest in to speak to him, and went through his pitch. At least I had a fun story to tell my uncle when he got back.

But finding it definitely opened up my eyes even more to my addiction. I'm 2 days sober and deleted my dealers number thanks to you all and this sub. Like so many of you, I have let this completely take over my life. Started at 14 in highschool, very quickly transitioning into an every day smoker. Using it to push down  loneliness, anxiety, feelings all together. Currently I'm 24. 25 in a few months. A whole decade. Being high has allowed me to be comfortable with not doing anything or reaching out to anyone. Every time I was going through something, I ran to my bong although deep down I was craving human connection more than anything. It made me comfortable with believing that I can't amount to anything without being high and that my feelings didn't need to be felt.

I know that was what I looked for desperately when I started taking the medication - but I instead found a laundry list of horrible side-effects. As someone with OCD and began taking it in the middle of a depressive episode, **finding the side-effects didn't encourage me to start taking it nor did it help me cope with the transition after I DID start taking it.** \n\nI have been on the medication for around 8 weeks now. I only take 5mg because I am sensitive to the medication. I am 19, female, and a sophomore in college. I'll save you the long-backstory as to why I started taking it, but just know I was suicidal, isolated, and losing hope quickly. Luckily my therapist and my boyfriend convinced me to start taking the medication. \n\nThe first few days were pretty intense. My suicidal ideation worsened, I was tired, and I was scared of the work I was going to have to put in to get my life back on track. I didn't know if that work would even pay-off. The side effects are real; I'm not going to sugar-coat it. But what helped me get through it was **writing down all of my side-effects** and telling them to my doctor. **Give yourself some extra TLC those first few days**. Stay with a friend, your family, or do whatever you have to do to keep yourself as safe and comfortable as possible. ***You're not a burden for needing help, I promise.*** \n\nI noticed that my mood was steadily improving. I opened the blinds in my room to let light in, I began to socialize, and I started to notice some positive changes in work ethic. Still, I got frustrated though because I didn't feel 100% after a few weeks. I was scared that I was putting in all of this effort - and hope- into something that would end in disappointment. Nonetheless, I kept taking it every night. \n\nI went back home for the holidays around week 6, and I don't know if it was the change in environment, the medication stabilizing, or both...but **suddenly all of the disjointed and scary thoughts that I had are fading or making sense.** I began to notice what triggers a bad mood, what behaviors I had that kept me in a depressive loop, etc. It just felt like I could *breathe* for the first time in months. What a relief that is.\n\n**Do I feel 100%? No,** **but** I am finally back to feeling comfortable with the unknown. I embrace growth, and **I embrace the life around me.** I noticed that I have to pee a lot and I bruise easily, but otherwise, I haven't noticed any prolonged side-effects. \n\n**I am so fucking thankful I started taking this medication**. I think it saved my life. I have more energy than I ever had before taking it, I am more confident in myself and my ideas, and I have *hope*. I have dreams again, which I haven't had since I was very young! This medication offered me a subtle change, which I appreciate. I still get anxious, I still have OCD and I still have depression. But now I know how to adapt and overcome those ailments. Anxiety is actually not all that bad as long as you have it in control. *I am starting to take control of my life.* \n\nI was very tempted to turn back to taking MDMA and saying fuck it - if I die, I die. In my experience, depression makes me feel like happiness is a thin veil that lies over a very cold and worthless reality. If you're currently depressed and reading this, you might not believe me, but I hope you hear and listen to a little nagging voice in the back of your brain telling you this: **It can improve. This life is worth living. Your quality of life is worth improving. You are capable of overcoming the side-effects that come with medication in order to heal.** \n\nAnd, if Lexapro is not for you, **you are brave enough to start a new medication, a new dosage, a new doctor\/therapist, until you find something that works for you.** \n\nNo, I don't know you, but I firmly believe this is true for everyone. Your path will look different than mine, but similar in a lot of ways too. That is sort of a beauty that comes with life\/humanity. We can relate from each other and learn from each other as well :)\n\nI did not intend to sound preachy or overly optimistic, so if I did, I am sorry. I know this post will not suddenly make your life infinitely better or necessarily increase the speed of your recovery. But I hope it gives you some relief while you are fighting the good fight. \n\nIf you have questions or want to talk, I will do my best to answer. \n\n**Good luck, friend.** \n\nThank you for reading my story.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"lexapro","subreddit_id":"t5_31mz6","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/lexapro","subreddit_subscribers":11413,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Hope DOES Exist - 8 Weeks on Lexapro","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lexapro\/comments\/eicmik\/hope_does_exist_8_weeks_on_lexapro\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I was a late college graduate (May 2018) and was unable to begin my 401k contributions until February 2019. I have been contributing 17% (with a 3% employee match) to that account, with 14% going into a Roth 401k and 3% going into a Traditional 401k. My wife is hired as a PRN at a local hospital, and therefore receives no benefits. \n\nI decided since I was behind in retirement, and she did not have any retirement, I opened a Roth IRA for us both in June 2019, putting $1,000 in mine and $1,500 in hers initially, with $500 going into each account every month. I began doing some reading on the differences between LSI and DCA, and found that lump sum was the better way to go, when one article talked about periodically investing from your paycheck when you receive it. We have the money automatically deposited and then automatically invested the next business day, so we do not invest using DCA. We do this because our emergency fund is right at 5-6 months of expenses, and we do not want to take money out of that to fund our Roth IRAs.\n\nMy question is: **should we stop monthly contributions to our Roth IRAs and put that money into our savings so we can invest it as a lump sum at the end of each year?** I am just worried about holding that money out of the accounts for an entire year only to deposit the whole $6,000 at the end of 2020, then 2021, etc. versus depositing the money monthly.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/personalfinance","subreddit_subscribers":14151602,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Should I stop our monthly Roth IRA Contributions in order to switch to an LSI approach?","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/eicred\/should_i_stop_our_monthly_roth_ira_contributions\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I'm a bit of a chill guy, whos just a bit anxious about going out to meet new people, but it's \"cuffing season\" with the new years around the corner figured I'd make a post on here as a way to try and get through that.\n\n-About me: I'm 5'11\". Dark brown hair, and eyes. Average-Thin build. Pale complexion (white).\n\n-Basic favorites: Color? Crimson Red. Food? Dish-Steak. Meal-Pizza. Treat-Sushi. Dessert-Candy. Movie? Terminator 2: Rise of the Machines. TV show? Rick and Morty. Song? Changes A LOT but currently: Good Man-Devour the Day. Car? Tesla Model X or 1969 Mustang. Animal? House-Cat. Wild-Penguin. Season? Fall. \n\nNow, that some of the obligatory stuff is out of the way; I'm also a bit of a \"nerd\" I play video games; especially League of Legends more than I probably should. Waiting on BL3 to come to steam. Also emulate pokemon, play runescape and a few other games sometimes but mostly League (atleast I'm good-ish at it, multi-season Diamond)... I also like anime\/manga (mostly anime) quite a lot; and in most varieties dark gritty things like Gantz&amp;Devilman Crybaby are two of my favorites, but I still love the shonen things such as Dr.Stone or Dragonball, the thought provoking ones like Code Geass and Death Note, and even still some of the emotional ones such as \"Snafu\" and Golden Time. \n\nBesides those 2 main hobbies of mine: I also enjoy going out walking, driving, swimming, etc... Or to go shopping sometimes, or sight seeing. An afternoon coffee shop stop just enjoying coffee and conversation is always nice. Who knows? Honestly pretty hard to suggest a time I won't enjoy. I'm 420 friendly and drinking friendly but I personally don't smoke or drink much due to bad lungs\/stomach not really agree with it. Bars and big parties and such make me a bit anxious but I can handle them usually. \n\nLastly: Now here's the real reason why you're here I'm sure I'm a cat guy if you noticed above in the favorites section... [Here's my boy Halo aka your main competition for my heart](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/534656985099010050\/661518485993685002\/IMG_20190831_222222.jpg) and well I have roommates who also have cats soo [Here's the real reason you're here; Kittens](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/534656985099010050\/661518854404571136\/IMG_20190725_150046.jpg)\n\nAnyway, please message me if interested in atleast talking... I'm down for just about anything, Gaming Buddy? Someone to talk to? Friend? Fwb? Girlfriend? Future-Wife? It all starts with a message on Reddit (or if you're shy-er than I am; a comment for me to send you some sort of icebreaker, which I totally will do)\n\nEdit: 1. Ignore my bad camera on the cat pics, 2. If you want a photo or anything else from me just message me asking for it, I'll happily provide confirmation","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ForeverAloneDating","subreddit_id":"t5_2sdpe","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ForeverAloneDating","subreddit_subscribers":117588,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"23 [M4F] Introverted Lansing\/Michigan Guy looking to meet","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ForeverAloneDating\/comments\/eicrjk\/23_m4f_introverted_lansingmichigan_guy_looking_to\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}
