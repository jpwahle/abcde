I feel so hormonal, just moodiness and emotional, I just want to eat and cry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I should just keep taking the pill or just go off it completely or what. I only have 1 refill left and I have an appt on the 27th to get a pap and a new prescription. But I am just so tired of being hormones. What can I do? I don&amp;#39;t want the paraguard or any IUD, I don&amp;#39;t want to be on hormones, I am too scared of getting pregnant to not be on a prescription bc. I&amp;#39;m just so frustrated and overwhelmed and my poor husband has to deal with my pyscho emotions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As of now, I just want to get off it. I am thinking about getting off of it for like 6 months and just see how I feel and trying to lose weight and get my blood pressure back down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone commenting about having a similar experience or to give advice/encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","mod_reports":[],"score":0,"permalink":"/r/birthcontrol/comments/1rvcpf/rant_i_feel_like_im_going_crazy/","domain":"self.birthcontrol","secure_media_embed":{},"gilded":0,"media_embed":{},"user_reports":[],"num_comments":0,"id":"1rvcpf","over_18":false}

{"created_utc":1385940664,"selftext":"First I'm going to give you a little bit of back story so you will be able to understand things thoroughly instead of starting from the middle.\n\nI joined the US Navy in the beginning of 2013, and was in the DEP program for about 5 or 6 months. Finally I was sent to bootcamp in July. I am an undesignated seaman so when I made it through bootcamp my A School was only about 3 weeks long. After I graduated my A school I was given 10 leave days, so like everyone who I graduated with, I went home to see family and friends. This is where things start to pick up a little bit. \n\nI was pretty excited to go home and visit everyone. I could finally relax a little bit and just have some fun before I reported to my ship.\n\n(I just want to say I will not be giving the name of my ship nor the location. Also I will be changing the names of certain people. Everything else is 100% true.)\n\nHome at last. When I walked inside It was pretty much the same. I put my stuff up in my bedroom and walked outside on our back patio which is where my older brother Zach was. I hadn't seen him since I had left for bootcamp so I was pretty excited to see him. We had a pretty strong relationship, and could talk about anything. Anyways, to my surprise my other brother was also out there. I hadn't seen him in years. My brothers are both older than me. I am 20 now but when I was about 16 my other brother Jacob took some job where he was always traveling around. We have no clue what he was doing. We had limited contact with him, so we only heard from him maybe a few times a year. Needless to say when I saw him I was pretty excited. Jacob and I hadn't had that strong of a relationship but I mean who wouldn't be excited to see their brother after about 4 years. We all visited with each other, ate dinner and then all decided to call it a night.\n\nEveryone had pretty much fallen asleep. I was up in my room watching TV just like I always used to before I left for bootcamp. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Jacob just standing there staring at me. I looked at him and asked him what was up, and he said, \"come here I have to show you something.\" My brother was a little strange and growing up with him you learn to just deal with it, so although it seems weird to you guys I didn't think anything of it. I got up and began to head downstairs, but couldn't see where Jacob had gone. He had literally just gone down the stairs, but it was though he had just vanished. I walked through the kitchen, and heard some noise from the back patio. I figured well Jacob must have went out there, and sure enough he was.\n\nAs I walked over to him he says, \"look out into the field and tell me what you see.\" Things were starting to get weird now. I chuckled a bit, and began to scan the horizon. I couldn't really see anything so I turned off the patio light so my eyes could adjust to the dark. I started looking again as I asked, \"what exactly am I looking for?\" I received no reply but I didn't need one. I glanced at Jacob and he says, \"you see them don't you?\" I definitely fucking saw them. I'm not sure what the hell these people were doing, but there was 6 of them. They were wearing these robes and they were just staring right at our house. I asked Jacob what they were doing and he said that he knew them, and that they wanted us to go with them. I told him it was getting pretty late and I think I'd pass. He just stared at me. No expression on his face or anything. I could feel this heavy pressure weighing over me and then Zach walked outside flipped on the light and said, \"oh you guys are still up? What are you up to?\" Jacob breaks the intense stare and says that we were just visiting, but that I was about to head to bed. I looked into the field to see if the people were still there and they were gone. I was pretty uneasy about the whole situation so I just went back to my room and went to sleep. Zach and Jacob stayed outside just bullshitting. I wanted to tell Zach what happened but I couldn't with Jacob there.\n\nThe next morning I woke up pretty early. Everyone was going about there usual day. My dad and step mom were off running errands, Zach was still asleep and Jacob was no where to be found. I couldn't stop thinking about the people in the field last night. I went over to the patio door and peaked out into the field. No one was there. Maybe Jacob went with them last night? I tried to just put it behind me and enjoy my leave. I cooked myself some breakfast and turned on ESPN. Not to long after, Zach walked in, and with a very puzzled look on his face said, \"when did you get back?\" I just laughed and asked what the hell he was talking about. He laughed a little himself and said, \"you and Jacob left to chill with his friends last night. Did you guys get back in this morning or what?\" I was a little creeped out now. I knew I didn't go anywhere last night. If I did I know I would have remembered. I tried explaining that I never left and asked if he was fucking with me. He got really serious, and asked if I really don't remember going with him. I kept telling him I didn't remember a thing. Zach said, \"that's weird dude maybe you guys drank a little to much last night. I was pretty much done trying to convince him that I didn't go anywhere last night. I decided I was going to try and get out of the house, and told Zach to let me know when Jacob got home. I put on some clothes and decided to go visit some friends.\n\n(Ill end here before it gets to long. I have much much more to tell, so please stick with me. Things get way more crazy and I can't explain what's happening. I am typing this on my ship as we speak, but like I said I wanted to start from the beginning because I feel whatever is going on now has to do with what happened when I went on leave, which was about 2 months ago give or take.)\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1rvltz/part_2/","is_self":true,"link_flair_css_class":null,"media":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":68,"author_flair_text":null,"banned_by":null,"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"author":"Joeshmo21","title":"My recent paranormal experiences which are still occurring.

{"retrieved_on":1411527479,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I&amp;#39;m 25 years old and have been trying to wrap my head around finance for the last six months or so. I wasn&amp;#39;t taught much other than to spend as little as possible while still having an enjoyable life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was finally able to pay off the last of my debts in October and have a decent (I think) surplus of cash starting to come in. I am beginning to analyze my spending habits to see where I can trim any excess expenses, but would like some other people&amp;#39;s opinions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My current finances are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salary: $53,500/year, paid weekly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary Checking Account: $2,092&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondary Checking Account: $1,200&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savings Account: $3,300 (depositing $100/week)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Retirement:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roth IRA: $725.00 (depositing $200/week)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investments: $10,000 in blue chip companies (inheritance)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was recently promoted to the head of the R&amp;amp;D department in the small company that I work at. I am assured a minimum of a 7% annual raise and have yet to receive one less than 9% (admittedly, I have only worked here for 2 years). This company has been around for over 20 years and is considered to be one of the best in it&amp;#39;s niche. It is a very stable company and I don&amp;#39;t anticipate my position being in jeopardy anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I currently have about $300 in savings a week, $100 of which I allocate to my savings and $200 to my Roth IRA. My secondary checking account is being used as a saving account (I realize I need to transfer this) for a musical instrument that I will be purchasing at some point in the next 10 years. I deposit $30/week in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My savings account is currently also serving as my emergency fund. I do not touch this and keep all funds for monthly expenses in my primary checking account. Once I accrue $6,000, I plan to invest $5,000 in a money market (something I just heard about). I will then build up another $6,000 and again invest in a money market. These two money market investments will then serve as my emergency fund. I would like to then build up my savings account to $2,000 and keep it there as a liquid reserve. Do you agree with this plan?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently started up my Roth IRA with Betterment.com. I know that they have higher fees, but I like the ease of use, the straight-forward information and general guidance. Once I exceed $100,000 in savings, I plan to switch to another platform with less fees (the transfer incurs a $300 fee), most likely Vanguard.

I wasn't taught much other than to spend as little as possible while still having an enjoyable life.\n\nI was finally able to pay off the last of my debts in October and have a decent (I think) surplus of cash starting to come in. I am beginning to analyze my spending habits to see where I can trim any excess expenses, but would like some other people's opinions.\n\nMy current finances are:\n\n* Salary: $53,500/year, paid weekly\n\n* Primary Checking Account: $2,092\n\n* Secondary Checking Account: $1,200\n\n* Savings Account: $3,300 (depositing $100/week)\n\nRetirement:\n\n* Roth IRA: $725.00 (depositing $200/week)\n\n* Investments: $10,000 in blue chip companies (inheritance)\n\nI was recently promoted to the head of the R&amp;D department in the small company that I work at. I am assured a minimum of a 7% annual raise and have yet to receive one less than 9% (admittedly, I have only worked here for 2 years). This company has been around for over 20 years and is considered to be one of the best in it's niche. It is a very stable company and I don't anticipate my position being in jeopardy anytime soon.\n\nI currently have about $300 in savings a week, $100 of which I allocate to my savings and $200 to my Roth IRA. My secondary checking account is being used as a saving account (I realize I need to transfer this) for a musical instrument that I will be purchasing at some point in the next 10 years. I deposit $30/week in it.\n\nMy savings account is currently also serving as my emergency fund. I do not touch this and keep all funds for monthly expenses in my primary checking account. Once I accrue $6,000, I plan to invest $5,000 in a money market (something I just heard about). I will then build up another $6,000 and again invest in a money market. These two money market investments will then serve as my emergency fund. I would like to then build up my savings account to $2,000 and keep it there as a liquid reserve. Do you agree with this plan?\n\nI recently started up my Roth IRA with Betterment.com. I know that they have higher fees, but I like the ease of use, the straight-forward information and general guidance. Once I exceed $100,000 in savings, I plan to switch to another platform with less fees (the transfer incurs a $300 fee), most likely Vanguard. In the meantime, I will be reading and learning more about savings. \n\n$200/week is more than the maximum I can invest in a Roth IRA in a year, so I will be putting the excess in a Roth 401K.\n\nAll money I receive from my stock market investments I put toward my Roth IRA/ Roth 401K.\n\nI live in NYC, so living costs are high. I plan on investing any extra income from raises into my retirement funds and don't see any reason to start living a more lavish lifestyle other than the singular large purchase of a marimba (~$13,000, to be purchased in about 10 years).\n\nWhile I plan on eventually purchasing a house, it won't be until I leave NYC, which won't be for at least 7 years.\n\nSo does this seem like a decent plan? Do you have any suggestions or critiques?\n\nThanks for everything, I feel like I've learned a lot reading this subreddit!\n\n\n**Edit:** The Betterment account does not cost $300 a year, it costs $300 to switch from them to someone else.\n","author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":8,"media":null,"link_flair_css_class":null}

Everything on the table including wife&amp;#39;s first bi experience, all was good except screwing the other dudes wife.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We met at a club, things are going ok. A few drinks, decent conversation. More drinks, wives are heavily flirting, but I&amp;#39;m getting no vibe from his wife, call her Elle. She had a couple of those, lean in real close to ask a question type things, but other than that, I had no clue. Full disclosure, she was 5&amp;#39;9 and I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;7, but I was fine with the height differences if she was, but as the night went on, I began to wonder if she wasn&amp;#39;t digging me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At another club, wives began dancing, guys are all over my wife, but their both having fun. The husband, call him Ray, says, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll play voyeur tonight.  You and your wife should get a piece of Elle, she&amp;#39;s great&amp;quot;. I tell him I don&amp;#39;t know how the night will go, but I thanked him for going out of his way to make me feel comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mention that his wife doesn&amp;#39;t seem interested in me. He says no way, she&amp;#39;s excited. Says I&amp;#39;m over thinking things. I have that tendency, so I decide he&amp;#39;s right. We invite them back to our hotel room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are experienced, but things seem awkward. Everyone is sitting back. So I take the initiative and take off my wife&amp;#39;s pants, I kiss her and let her know it&amp;#39;s ok to kiss Elle. Ray tells Elle she should give my wife a kiss, and Elle responds a bit coldly that they are grown women and can make up their own minds.  Not exactly a hot start. The girls start kissing, and Elle is very slow about it. My wife keeps moving her hands down but Elle is keeping her legs shut. Note: My wife doesn&amp;#39;t like slow and sensuous, she likes passion and agression, I can tell she is getting bored.  My wife asks if we are joining, but Ray kept his word and said no, and I said not yet, not wanting to barge in on my wife&amp;#39;s experience.  Besides, I was waiting for Elle to nod or invite me, but got nothing, so I assume I&amp;#39;m not wanted yet...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They end up naked and touching. She goes down on my wife. Ray said I should join in. I went to the side of my wife, touched her breasts, kissed her - she reached for me and started giving me a BJ. I&amp;#39;m getting hard, I reach down to touch my wife, but Elle doesn&amp;#39;t move or acknowledge me...after a while, I again decide I&amp;#39;m not wanted yet and go sit.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife takes her turn giving Elle oral, again Ray suggests I touch his wife. I go to her side and massage her breasts, I touch her clit while my wife tongue fucks her. She never once reaches for me. I touch my wife from behind and think about fucking her, but really, it feels like we&amp;#39;re the only ones interested in any of this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Elle isn&amp;#39;t cumming, so Ray asks if she wants us to suck her tits. She says yes. Me and him suck her tits while my wife continues oral. Elle finally reaches to me and plays with my balls...and nothing else. I am not turned on at all. Not hard. In fact, I&amp;#39;m disconnected and bored. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ray says maybe it&amp;#39;s time the girls concentrate on me. My wife gives me oral while Elle again plays with balls again. I ask my wife if she wants oral from Ray, she says yes and I invite Ray over. 3 different times he declines. No matter what, I can not get this party started and I am done being hard. Elle leaves to go to the bathroom, my wife gets in position for me to fuck her, but I can&amp;#39;t hard. We both agree we are done with a fairly disappointing evening. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ray and Elle say they had a great night, but my wife and I just feel kind of deflated from the evening. We decide to have sex, she&amp;#39;s wet and I&amp;#39;m hard and we have great sex. After, we wonder why we even bothered doing this.

Everything on the table including wife's first bi experience, all was good except screwing the other dudes wife.\n\nWe met at a club, things are going ok. A few drinks, decent conversation. More drinks, wives are heavily flirting, but I'm getting no vibe from his wife, call her Elle. She had a couple of those, lean in real close to ask a question type things, but other than that, I had no clue. Full disclosure, she was 5'9 and I'm 5'7, but I was fine with the height differences if she was, but as the night went on, I began to wonder if she wasn't digging me.\n\nAt another club, wives began dancing, guys are all over my wife, but their both having fun. The husband, call him Ray, says, \"I'll play voyeur tonight.  You and your wife should get a piece of Elle, she's great\". I tell him I don't know how the night will go, but I thanked him for going out of his way to make me feel comfortable. \n\nI mention that his wife doesn't seem interested in me. He says no way, she's excited. Says I'm over thinking things. I have that tendency, so I decide he's right. We invite them back to our hotel room. \n\nThey are experienced, but things seem awkward. Everyone is sitting back. So I take the initiative and take off my wife's pants, I kiss her and let her know it's ok to kiss Elle. Ray tells Elle she should give my wife a kiss, and Elle responds a bit coldly that they are grown women and can make up their own minds.  Not exactly a hot start. The girls start kissing, and Elle is very slow about it. My wife keeps moving her hands down but Elle is keeping her legs shut. Note: My wife doesn't like slow and sensuous, she likes passion and agression, I can tell she is getting bored.  My wife asks if we are joining, but Ray kept his word and said no, and I said not yet, not wanting to barge in on my wife's experience.  Besides, I was waiting for Elle to nod or invite me, but got nothing, so I assume I'm not wanted yet...\n\nThey end up naked and touching. She goes down on my wife. Ray said I should join in. I went to the side of my wife, touched her breasts, kissed her - she reached for me and started giving me a BJ. I'm getting hard, I reach down to touch my wife, but Elle doesn't move or acknowledge me...after a while, I again decide I'm not wanted yet and go sit.  \n\nMy wife takes her turn giving Elle oral, again Ray suggests I touch his wife. I go to her side and massage her breasts, I touch her clit while my wife tongue fucks her. She never once reaches for me. I touch my wife from behind and think about fucking her, but really, it feels like we're the only ones interested in any of this. \n\nElle isn't cumming, so Ray asks if she wants us to suck her tits. She says yes. Me and him suck her tits while my wife continues oral. Elle finally reaches to me and plays with my balls...and nothing else. I am not turned on at all. Not hard. In fact, I'm disconnected and bored. \n\nRay says maybe it's time the girls concentrate on me. My wife gives me oral while Elle again plays with balls again. I ask my wife if she wants oral from Ray, she says yes and I invite Ray over. 3 different times he declines. No matter what, I can not get this party started and I am done being hard. Elle leaves to go to the bathroom, my wife gets in position for me to fuck her, but I can't hard. We both agree we are done with a fairly disappointing evening. \n\nRay and Elle say they had a great night, but my wife and I just feel kind of deflated from the evening. We decide to have sex, she's wet and I'm hard and we have great sex. After, we wonder why we even bothered doing this. We spent money on clothes for her for the evening, drinks, and a hotel room when we could have spent the money on ourselves and just had the sex with someone we know we connect with,  each other.\n\nWe seriously left the hotel the next morning saying it wasn't worth it and we were done with it.

Any ideas, thoughts, advice welcomed.\n\nI am 24 year old, 5'10.5\" female. 200lbs, large frame with muscular athletic build. Overall in good health. Physically active, very diet conscious.\n\n2012-ish:\nTwo years ago, I was diagnosed with tachycardia. I wore a monitor (holt I believe?) for weeks and had labs and an EKG done. Everything was normal except the tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. I was not referred to a cardiologist but one reviewed my monitor results (military healthcare). My resting heart rate is around 100-110 with regular spikes into the 140-50s. Simple exercise, say 1-2 minutes on an elliptical, pushes my heart up to 195-205. (This is new- I've not had this kind if elevation until the last year or two). I was given the choice whether to take beta blockers and chose not to as they'd make me tired.\n\n2008-2009ish:\nOther possibly relevant health history might be an incident from 5 years ago with a sharp, unbearable pain in my left side under my ribs. Wasn't costocondritis or a rib dysfunction or anything. No brain lesions. Numerous ER visits, specialty care. and PT never found the cause. The pain was consistently terrible for months and slowly subsided. The area is still occasionally tender.  Along with the pain came numbness and tingling in my hands, feet, and occasionally on my face (chin and upper lip). The tingling is much better and is now more of a rare occurrence. No cause was found. The doctors did find a huge  Schmorl's Node that they disagreed with each other over the significance of.\n\nToday:\nMy tachycardia has gotten worse. My resting heart is still 100-110, but it now gets so high working out that it's hard to deal with (205-210 during cardio). My heartrate spikes randomly and I often wake up with an elevated heart rate. No headaches but I'm sometimes dizzy standing up.\n\nI had an incident three weeks ago of severe nausea and vomiting with tachycardia and palpitations after TWO bourbons (no caffeine or anything) 4-5 hours previously. The incident last 6 hours or so. I saw my primary care the next day. He ran fasting bloodwork and it was all normal. (Sodium was a tiny bit low). He ordered a 24 urine for pheochromocytoma but I haven't been able to complete it yet (was planning on today until last nights incident).\n\n had another incident last. After 4 bourbons between 11am and 6pm during football games (no caffeine or nicotine or anything else), my tachycardia kicked up around 10pm. I don't think my heart rate was that high but it felt like it was beating so hard (just as the previous incident). I started vomiting uncontrollably and eventually ended up in the ER. The doctors got my to stop vomiting and gave me fluids and ran blood work. All normal I believe. They gave me Ativan to try to slow my heart down an relax me (it was about 115 after 4 hours of no vomiting and laying down).

Any ideas, thoughts, advice welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am 24 year old, 5&amp;#39;10.5&amp;quot; female. 200lbs, large frame with muscular athletic build. Overall in good health. Physically active, very diet conscious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2012-ish:\nTwo years ago, I was diagnosed with tachycardia. I wore a monitor (holt I believe?) for weeks and had labs and an EKG done. Everything was normal except the tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. I was not referred to a cardiologist but one reviewed my monitor results (military healthcare). My resting heart rate is around 100-110 with regular spikes into the 140-50s. Simple exercise, say 1-2 minutes on an elliptical, pushes my heart up to 195-205. (This is new- I&amp;#39;ve not had this kind if elevation until the last year or two). I was given the choice whether to take beta blockers and chose not to as they&amp;#39;d make me tired.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2008-2009ish:\nOther possibly relevant health history might be an incident from 5 years ago with a sharp, unbearable pain in my left side under my ribs. Wasn&amp;#39;t costocondritis or a rib dysfunction or anything. No brain lesions. Numerous ER visits, specialty care. and PT never found the cause. The pain was consistently terrible for months and slowly subsided. The area is still occasionally tender.  Along with the pain came numbness and tingling in my hands, feet, and occasionally on my face (chin and upper lip). The tingling is much better and is now more of a rare occurrence. No cause was found. The doctors did find a huge  Schmorl&amp;#39;s Node that they disagreed with each other over the significance of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today:\nMy tachycardia has gotten worse. My resting heart is still 100-110, but it now gets so high working out that it&amp;#39;s hard to deal with (205-210 during cardio). My heartrate spikes randomly and I often wake up with an elevated heart rate. No headaches but I&amp;#39;m sometimes dizzy standing up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had an incident three weeks ago of severe nausea and vomiting with tachycardia and palpitations after TWO bourbons (no caffeine or anything) 4-5 hours previously. The incident last 6 hours or so. I saw my primary care the next day. He ran fasting bloodwork and it was all normal. (Sodium was a tiny bit low). He ordered a 24 urine for pheochromocytoma but I haven&amp;#39;t been able to complete it yet (was planning on today until last nights incident).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;had another incident last. After 4 bourbons between 11am and 6pm during football games (no caffeine or nicotine or anything else), my tachycardia kicked up around 10pm. I don&amp;#39;t think my heart rate was that high but it felt like it was beating so hard (just as the previous incident). I started vomiting uncontrollably and eventually ended up in the ER. The doctors got my to stop vomiting and gave me fluids and ran blood work. All normal I believe. They gave me Ativan to try to slow my heart down an relax me (it was about 115 after 4 hours of no vomiting and laying down).  The Ativan was calming and made me sleep, but my heart rate and BP stayed elevated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So from my understanding, I still need to rule out pheochromocytoma with the 24 urine. The doctors have said it might be a benign tachycardia and I may just need I start on a beta blocker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything else I should be asking about?

I dont claim to be a master, but I do know how to conduct myself in these areas and I&amp;#39;m not afariad to ask questions when I dont know how to do something. I work well with others, and Im very good with customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have also been a stable boy(6 horses) and worked on farms my whole life. Ive woken up early to feed cows, goats chickens. This is more what Im looking for, but anything will do as long as its not in an office or on a computer or in a retail store. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have experience with chainsaws, splitting wood. Small machinery(tractors, small excavators bob-cats)\nI have my diploma and have some college under my belt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone actually contacts me for work it must be extended at least to the winter, and I may stay through winter depends on the situation. I may even stay forever. This is my dream and I have gotten so close on different occasions to be brought back by family members worried about me. I need a foothold to get started. Im no McCandles, My intent is to work and create a living for myself that is simpler in ideas but created by my own hands. I am a country boy raised hunting and taking care of animals. And the area/culture that I live in looks down on this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","permalink":"/r/alaska/comments/1ruvxl/looking_for_work_in_alaska_anywhere/","score":4,"domain":"self.alaska","num_comments":13,"user_reports":[],"id":"1ruvxl","over_18":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"media_embed":{},"gilded":0}

But, with the environment I&amp;#39;m in now, there&amp;#39;s NO WAY I can come out. I live in Jacksonville, Fl, which is this huge CONSERVATIVE city with a small-town feel. I&amp;#39;m filipino &amp;amp; my ENTIRE family is extremely religious, like kick-my-ass-out-of-the-house-&amp;amp;-never-talk-to-us-again type pious. I&amp;#39;m still largely, financially dependent on them, so I can&amp;#39;t move out or anything. I wish that when I was younger &amp;amp; in high school I knew what I was doing with my education, but instead I fucked it up, by moping around, being sad as fuck, &amp;amp; trying to get people to like me. I could&amp;#39;ve been in Med school or in a grad program by now, but I let my insecurity as a goddamn fairy get the best of me. So instead, I&amp;#39;ve let my intelligence go to waste &amp;amp; I&amp;#39;ve underachieved every opportunity I&amp;#39;ve had. I always dreamed of running away from my family &amp;amp; the people I grew up with and being someone else and being in a bigger city, but my worst nightmare has come true: I&amp;#39;m still the same, insecure as shit person I was 6 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now, here I am, venting to bunch of random strangers who 90% who read this have NO idea how being gay feels. LET ME TELL YOU HOW IT FEELS. Imagine going swimming in a pool &amp;amp; drowning, and NO ONE is coming to save you. Instead of thinking some lifeguard is going to come for you, all you FEEL, is the constant force of being dragged down. All you THINK, is how no one is going to come for you, not even family. But everyone knows what&amp;#39;s happening, everyone can see the water splashing around &amp;amp; your arms flailing about. Everyone can see you suffocating, but FUCK YOUR LIFE kid, you don&amp;#39;t deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is how it feels every fucking day, like you can&amp;#39;t breathe, like your swimming against the currents. Everyday is a constant battle with me &amp;amp; how masculine I&amp;#39;m portraying myself. Did I say that in a deep enough voice? Are my hands moving around too much? WALK STIFFER, YOU GODDAMN HOMOSEXUAL. All you hear everyday is how some gay dudes got beaten up outside the bar or that FAGS ARE GOING BURN IN HELL. Shit, I hated that. Why would GOD make me gay just to send me to eternal damnation? I remember hearing that God gives you burdens that He knows you can handle. ARE YOU THERE GOD, IT&amp;#39;S ME, RXHCS &amp;amp; I&amp;#39;M FALLING APART! I feel so incredibly lonely and lost, &amp;amp; just, well I don&amp;#39;t know, I can&amp;#39;t stop crying to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to give myself ultimatums. When I was 14, I thought to myself that if I was still gay by the time I was 18, I&amp;#39;d kill myself. When I was 18, it became 21. All that time in between was a waste of trying to be someone I wasn&amp;#39;t or denying who I was. And now, I feel so trapped, like theres no end in sight. No bright light at the end of the tunnel, no sense of happiness at the end. And that fucking scares the shit out me, that I&amp;#39;m going to be forever alone. That I&amp;#39;m never going to find someone who ENJOYS me &amp;amp; being around me &amp;amp; being in LOVE with me. Instead I just feel like I should just stop swimming &amp;amp; stop trying, because to be honest, I&amp;#39;m eager for completion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried putting myself out there. I went to a gay club in Orlando, but then I left because it was pretty fucking boring &amp;amp; no one was there. Apparently, 10pm is pretty early for nightclub. WHO MAKES ALL THESE RULES UP? I tried going to an &lt;a href=\"/r/gaybros\"&gt;/r/gaybros&lt;/a&gt; meet up, but there was only like 5 people there &amp;amp; I got hella insecure &amp;amp; decided to hang out with my friend much more instead. I know, I know -- I&amp;#39;m a fucking pussy. TBH, I&amp;#39;m not much of a gaybro, I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m masculine enough. Then I tried strictly visiting &lt;a href=\"/r/gaymers\"&gt;/r/gaymers&lt;/a&gt;, but then I&amp;#39;m not much of a gamer. All I feel is that I&amp;#39;m this blob of an existence that not even the gays will appreciate. I have an OKCUPID profile, but mostly a lot of people seem so weird &amp;amp; random &amp;amp; cringeworthy. I felt that once I started putting myself out there, the stars would align, a unicorn would come &amp;amp; I&amp;#39;d ride her out on a rainbow to pot of weed. But no such luck, GODDAMN JACKSONVILLE, 12th most populous city in the US, &amp;amp; not only does the Jaguars suck, but I can&amp;#39;t find ONE DECENT guy who&amp;#39;ll just understand the place that I&amp;#39;m in &amp;amp; just be friends or maybe more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to this end here, because my eyes are now past the point of tears &amp;amp; it&amp;#39;s starting to feel irritated. I would love to go on, but this post has gotten too long. Sorry for all the words &amp;amp; I apologize if I offended anyone.

It's a great joke to him to say a sentence then bark: 'NADIA WHAT DID I JUST SAY?!' at the end of it, and make me stand up in front of the other girls and repeat what he just said, on the off chance I was paying attention.
