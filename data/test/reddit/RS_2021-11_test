My mum is mentally ill, she has borderline personality disorder. Her behavior is wrong in so many areas, she was physically abusive and emotionally too. I think she was sexually abusive with me too. There was not an explicit sexual intercourse nor even masturbation but some things are really off and so I'm 20 and I have intimacy issues, I can't kiss guys or show affection to others, I grew up feeling guilty, disgusting and dirty so her behaviors really affected me. When I'm with friends and we're just on our bras I feel disgusting, I've always felt disgusting and dirty.\n\nI really need to share my flashbacks and connect to others who can understand because I'm broken now, although I understand it might be triggering for some. Thanks for anyone who reads me, I really need some support now because I'm coping with dissociation, I can't make sense of many things and I still live with her 🥺\n\n\\- The most disturbing thing is that until I was like 10 she would touch my genitals making me arouse and laugh. For example she would tickle my vagina or rub my genitals and that would make me arouse and laugh so she thought it was funny. Sometimes I had my clothes on but sometimes I didn't, she always wanted to see and check my genitals and she wanted to check my pubic hair when it was growing. As I became an adolescent she kind of stopped wanting to touch my vagina. She would joke how my little sweetie pie is only hers and only hers. She would also tickle my thighs. I think the fact that it made me arouse as a kid makes me feel so guilty and disgusting. Like I wanted it to happen. \n\n\\- Another disturbing thing is that whenever I had a medical issue as a kid she seemed to be a bit sexual when rubbing oil on my skin or on my genitals or butt. I remember when I got sick she would put on my anus a pill and she did nothing explicit but I felt so dirty when she did it somehow. I've internalized a lot of dirt associated with medical care. I mean she was my mum so she had to take care of my medical needs, but her over sexuality due to her illness really made me feel so disgusting. This was until few months ago, I remember my feet hurt and she would massage my feet in a passionate way. I've realized it was uncomfortable so I've stopped. But I've never went to see a gynecologist because I'm afraid of being sexually aroused and I don't want her to be disgusted at me. It was just my mum was making me aroused by robbing oil on my gentilas so... I feel so disgusting if I think about it I want to cry desperately\n\n\\- Another very disturbing thing is that she would let me be naked in the house. She would make me take off my clothes and take pictures of me. I have some pictures where I'm laughing with my clothes off, showing my private parts and being happy. I feel extremely sexualized by her behavior. I felt used like a sex toy. I know it wasn't extreme but it really affected me and broke me, to see my naked pictures. Even as a toddler there's a picture of me naked... It was so heartbreaking.\n\n\\- Another very disturbing thing was that she sexualized me and my brother. She would make us kiss everyday for years, in her ill mind she thought it was a way for us to get along. Also she would make us run naked in the house and just be naked a lot. Especially taking naked baths together. We just played together. But there's a picture where we were kids and we were both naked and I was hugging him from behind so my gentilas were probably robbing on his butt and I can't shake the feeling of having harmed him. I also have a memory of us taking a bath and it breaks my heart because I remember as a kid sitting on his back naked, so I have this feeling of my genitals rubbing in his back and I feel so terrible because it feels I've violated him. I know it was my ill mum who sexualized us but I feel so heartbroken and terrible. I care about my brother. I never wanted to be sexual with him... Why would she do that?\n\n\\- Another very disturbing memory is that until I was 10 she would sleep on my bed with me and to make me fall asleep she said she needed to massage my butt. She called it \"the little massage\". She trained me so that I couldn't fall asleep if I didn't have this little massage. She would massage my butt with my clothes on and it relaxed me aroused me a bit. It felt really good to me because it was my only way to fall asleep and my mum would make me do it. I feel disgusting because I used it as a way to fall asleep. I remember once going to camping with friends and I couldn't fall asleep so I've started to give myself that little massage and I could fall asleep. I felt really wrong and disgusting because of it. Also she gave me her clothes to sleep with so that it had her smell on it, it was my way to fall asleep as a kid. Her smell was really relaxing to me but now I really feel disgusting when she's close to me.\n\n\\- She has a very disturbing relationship with brother too and it makes me nauseous so bad. Like now still that he's 16. He was circumcised last week and she took pictures of his dick for \"medical reasons\" and was constantly checking on him and medicating him. And when he gets hurt or something she's super happy to put body lotion on the area, like it's arousing to her and it's disgusting.\n\n\\- She let me take care of her physical needs like rubbing oil cream on her back, neck, putting her bra on and zipping her clothes. \n\n\\- As a kid she let me touch her breasts often, letting me touching them and how big they were. Until last month, she touched my breasts saying they are very cute and it's hers. That I'm cute. Ive stopped letting her do that. Last time she saw me with my bra and panties she looked at me in disgust so I stopped showing myself with no clothes on in front of her.\n\n\\- The way she kisses me is not appropriate. That's because she kisses me on the cheeks but her lips are humid and moist and I've always found it disgusting honestly. It was very very hurtful for me. She always asks me for a kiss and when I reject her she forces herself on me. She gives me that moist disgusting lips kiss and I just feel so dirty when she does it because I don't want it to happen.\n\n\\- The way she hugged me was not appropriate. When laying in bed as a kid she would come on top of me in a sexual pose like a cat and forces herself on top of me and kissing me. I felt very powerless and defenseless, I didn't know what to do and felt suffocating because I didn't want it to happen. As a kid I would play with her and get aroused but I feel guilty somehow.\n\n\\- She had explicit sexual moments of intimacy with my dad. As a kid they had sex leaving the door half open and she didn't care. So I was really shocked by her extreme sexuality, the way she would be in top of him and I have images of her rubbing him. I was so shocked as a kid and felt disgusting for assisting the scenes. Or she would sit on my dad laps and rub his genitals in front of me. Or she would kiss him showing her tongue. \n\n\\- She had sexual explicit moments with strangers: she touches her boobs in front of strangers, shows her butt slightly and her panties and she jokes about it. She says she's used to seeing naked people and there's nothing bad with nudity and penises. People are SO UNCOMFORTABLE. She explicitly flirts with guys she explicitly shows she's sexually interested and available and I've always felt embarrassed because she's married. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean thanks for anyone who reads this I'm feeling devastated right now... It was emotionally releasing to write it though. I'm so heartbroken and I can't shake off the feeling of disgust for being aroused at those things as a kid. What can I do?

I've kinda been on cruise control, no major cravings or desire to drink for a few weeks.  I'm really looking forward to saying I have 60 days in.  It was never my intention to quit for good.  I enjoy drinking, I stay out of trouble.  When I was drinking it was probably around 15 lite beers a day, everyday.  I keep reminding myself how much work sucked every morning, feeling like crap.  I felt guilty for drinking everyday especially work days.  If not for health issues I wouldn't have quit.  In the past week I've been flirting with the idea of drinking a 40 before dinner but I know I'll just end up running to the store to buy more.  Last night I had a bad mood swing. I didn't even have a huge desire to drink I was just so bored and angry for no reason.  When I went to bed I felt thankful that I didn't drink, when I woke up I felt thankful I didn't drink.  But today I'm still in a bad mood.  Nothing seems to be making me happy or even interested in anything.  I love football and just don't care today. I feel really sleepy.  I woke up at 7am and took a nap from 12:30 to 2:30 PM. Then again from 5 to 7.  I feel hopeless for some reason.  I have a set goal to not drink until at least the 17th when I see my doctor again, I know I won't slip up before then.  I keep thinking about the next time I drink. Under what circumstances? I don't know.  Right now I can't even think of a circumstance that I would want to drink.  It's probably going to end up being a night like last night when I'm just bored.  I'm dreading how I'll feel the next morning, not so much the hangover but the feeling everyone shares after ruining a streak of however long.  Why am I even stressing it if I'm stopping for health purposes mainly?  My doctor said it probably wouldn't hurt to have a few drinks.  I guess all that matters is I'm sober now, I'm 100% confident I'll be able to say I'm 60 days sober Friday, and I'm 90% sure I'll be able to say I'm still sober of the 17th.\n\nBy the time I got done texting all this I started feeling a little better.  I probably won't be able to get to sleep tonight because I slept so much today.  I hope I don't have anxiety. 1 thing I've learned is working tired sucks but it's a lot worse working tired and hungover.  Til next time.\n\nPs.

Headache medication just makes me tired or I am just getting side effects from them. I never tried opioids.

Thank you for reading my post.\n\nI am a very young stepmom. I'm 24 and have been a stepmom for 5 years since I was 19. I was just a kid, just moved out of my parents when I met my now-husband. I knew he was the one and also knew that he had a son right after we started dating. They didn't get married nor divorce. They were together for 2 months when she got pregnant and she left him 6 months after SS was born. Then took him to the court to get the child support that she wants. He also introduce me to his son ( was 2 at the time, now he's 7) almost immediately.\n\nI have to say the first 3 years were really hard for me. The jealousy, the insecurities ate me from inside out. Knowing how bad she treated my husband and what she put him through, it was not a good first impression. She took advantage of us a lot and always lie to get what she wants. It makes me not trust her anymore. for example, lying that she was sick and needed food, asked us to get her some food and she would give the money back. Did that, she said she doesn't have cash and would pay back later but ofc, she lied to get what she wants. Now mind you, I was a kid and nobody teach me how to be a stepmom. I thought about quitting a lot but it was my husband and my son that stopped me from doing that. I love them both so much and they are a big part of my life just like how they are a part of mine.\n\nBut I've never realized how much anxiety I have when she's around like today. This is what happens to me every time when I know we would have to get together. My heart beats so much faster, I get hotter, I sweat for no reason, my mind closes down, I can't think. Just like I put myself into a defend mode. it's an anxiety disorder when you have anxiety even when there's no threat. Maybe I think she's a threat to our relationship? I don't talk to her. I let my husband do all the talking and do my stepmom's jobs when my son is with us. I try my best to have a good relationship with her but I don't know how to handle this anxiety. It really messes me up and I do not like it a bit. I will make this straight, I do not want to be her friend, we just co-parenting and everything is for my kid. My goal is not friending but I give my son his best life and I feel like I can do that without being friendly to her.\n\nMy husband totally understands its hard shoes that I am in and he really supports me with whatever I want to do. He put my feelings second after our son and I appreciate it so much. He tries to keep their relationship business likes and only talks about our son.\n\nI realized what really trigger me is when she is insiders my houses. I'm fine with her when we're all outside at sport practice, school or public events. But as soon as she set a step in my house, i can feel the anxiety starts raising. I tried to ask my SO about it, like let get him ready and wait for her outside when she picks him up. But yesterday was Halloween and we said be here at 6pm so we can do trick or treat. She came 15mins earlier and just wandering in our house. I hate that! There was time we asked her to wait outside but she opened the door and get in anyways. I feel like i have power and boundaries about that. I don't want to tell my son that i don't want his mom in my house because sometimes he wants to show her things that he has here.\n\nMy question here is, how can I handle the anxiety that I have about my son's mom? it's not healthy and i do not like that but at the same time, I don't know how to make things better.  Please help!!!\n\nIf you read until this, thank you so much. :)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stepparents","subreddit_id":"t5_2t08x","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/stepparents","subreddit_subscribers":58858,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I don't know how to handle my anxiety when my SS's mom is around.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.44,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/stepparents\/comments\/qk2dyy\/i_dont_know_how_to_handle_my_anxiety_when_my_sss\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I am apart of the youth league since I am not 18, and there are a lot of younger children than me. there is a kid who normally plays really well, and because of that he is held to a high standard by his parents to exceed in this sport, but I believe they are abusive to him.

I'm a switch looking for another switch but if you aren't, then either a domme or a sub works too since I lean both ways. I have been rp-ing for a while but never really found anyone who clicked so now I'm trying to create a detailed post to hopefully find the one I'm looking for. This is going to be a long post and somewhat convoluted at times but if you believe we'd be a good match, hit me up! While I do not expect you to write something as long as I did, please put some effort into it :)\n\nMost activities I list below are ones I enjoy both as a dom or as a sub! You don't have to be into everything that I list but if there's anything in particular that you like, I'd be happy to discuss more and almost everything that I list is open to negotiation (I'm pretty flexible) and I'm open to any ideas that you might have as well so feel free to share because chances are I’d be into it if it’s not listed as a limit!\n\nSome things about me: I'm 20, over 6 feet tall, skinny, and have short black hair. If I'm playing the dominant role, I like putting a collar and a leash on my sub because it gives me a sense of ownership and I would be open to trying out the same as a sub. I always enjoy casual activities with my partner. If you enjoy being tied up we could just lie on the bed or on the couch while watching a show or a movie while I practice tying you up different ways. I enjoy both a relaxing night in and going out to eat or have fun or just go on a long late-night drive. While I enjoy having rules and a good girl that follows them, I'm not too sadistic for the most part. If, however, you enjoy getting paddled till you're bruised and have a hard time walking or sitting, I'd be happy to oblige, but I'd like to draw the line at blood or anything that causes permanent damage. I'm okay with a sub that's naughty\/ a little bratty, but I'd prefer someone who's not too bratty (I am into CNC though).\n\nIf something is not listed in my limits, chances are I’m into it so hmu even if you have unusual or specific fantasies because I love to explore!\n\nNon-sexual ideas\/rules I'd enjoy doing to you:\n-Massages. You ask and I'll consider allowing you to touch your Master. Maybe I'll even give you the pleasure of seeing my body so you can please me more. Sometimes I may just demand it.\n-You will be on a collar that's attached to me (such as my leg or ankle) by a leash. there will be some loose reign but not too much. If I feel that leash tug it's a punishment.\n-A point system. You drink 3 cups of water a day? You get 3 points (no, there isn't drinking more cups for more points). However, if you miss one of your daily cups you get 4 points taken away. These points can be saved up and used to \"buy\" rewards or fantasies that are within my ability.\n-You will answer my questions with \"yes\/no, __\" (depending on the title you decide to call me). If you are asking a question then my title must be used in it.\n-Wearing a collar at all times (a discreet \"collar\" will be used outside of play such as a choker, bracelet, or a ring).\n-I take a shower with the curtain open and you wait outside on your knees, naked (maybe tied or gagged) and with a towel for me to finish.\n-You write in a journal how every scene\/punishment\/funishment went and how everything felt. Should include what you, what you didn't and any other comments. I will read it with an open mind and no judgement whatsoever. This will help both of us.\n-I will snap and point at the floor by my feet, you should be on your knees in front of me.\n-I take the first bite of anything we eat, you must wait. You make me a plate of food and bring it.\n-Leg rest for me if I need it. Or just kneeling by me while I sit down and rest your head in my lap.\n--Once a month tell me a new punishment, funishment and reward you would like.\n\nBedroom\/behind closed doors ideas\/rules I'd enjoy doing to you:\n-After I finish certain amount of times you may cum once.\n-Flip a coin. There can be a lot that goes with this. Heads you get a reward or tails we do a funishment. Heads you serve me for an hour, tails you serve me for 3 hours ;) That type of stuff.\n-You get a chastity coupon that you can use at any time to be put in chastity.\n-Ask permission to cum, ask permission to touch me, ask permission to...well anything we decide.\nYou would be given a certain time outside chastity to make yourself cum while I watch. First day would be 30 seconds, you didn't do it? Well now it stays on for another day. Better luck tomorrow and if I'm feeling generous I may allow you 45 seconds.\n-Setting a limit of how many orgasms you are along in a week. Only 2? Better decide wisely when to cash them in.\n-Always thank me after you cum. I don't care if I made you get yourself off, In the end it was still me that allowed it.\n-Tell me when you're turned on- doesn't mean you get to cum. I just get to tease you about it.\n-I may gag you until your mouth has a use.\n-I blindfold you, maybe even tie your hands. Now get me the chastity belt in 30 seconds or it's going on for an hour while I tease you.\n-Tie up your hands so you can't use them to help. You must then get hard for me in 5 minutes by whatever means necessary, you can bump the fuck out of my leg if you think it will help. If you can't, it's chastity. If you do, I'll ride you for a certain time (with your hands still tied of course). If you don't get hard enough to my standards it's a punishment. (If I'm the sub)\n-Making you crawl towards me\n-Marking. Body writing, biting, bruises, hickeys.\n\nSome ideas\/rules I'd enjoy doing in public areas:\n(Though I'm not one for public play, serving outside of kink as a reminder that I'm still in charge even if I don't have a flogger in hand. These would include things such as:)\n-Carry things I hand to you.\n-Open the door and make sure I walk through first. This could extend to opening the car door for me.\n-You drive when we go places. I may want to rub my hands on your leg or tease you.\n-Holding hands but my hand will be in front\n-Piggy backing off the other one, but I'll hold my hand out in public and you immediately grab it. Or while we are spending time together.\n-I order for you. You tell me certain things you'd be interested in but I'll be the one choosing what you'll be eating (I wouldn't make it anything you don't like\/allergic to of course).\n\nLimits:\n-As mentioned before, blood. I love giving bruises, bites and hickeys but I don't want to do any permanent damage to you.\n-Complete servitude. While I enjoy having my sub as my personal fuck toy to do whatever I want with- you are your own person. You won't be completely dependent on me. I'll encourage your hobbies and support you but I don't want to be in control of your whole life.\n-Watersports and scat.\n-Diaper play\n\nPunishments:\n-Lengthen time of chastity\n-Edging yourself for an extended period of time and never getting to cum\n-Kneeing on rice, hard floor or anything uncomfortable.\n-Holding things for a certain period of time, if dropped time restarts and may be doubled.\n-Standing for a certain period of time, maybe in a awkward position so you can think on how to please me better next time.\n-Write out coupons...for me!\n-Write lines such as \"I won't cum unless Master allows me\" 100, 200, maybe 300 times? Depends on how bad it was.\n-Hands tied for the day, that mouth will be getting a workout.\n-Give the worst 3 punishments. Next time all 3 are put in a bowl and you draw one out to do.\n-You watch me make myself hard, then you wait until I go soft then immediately make me hard again. This goes on until you're satisfied or I physically can't. In that case it will continue tomorrow. (If I'm a sub)\n-I can't get hard for a certain amount of time, if I do then I go in chastity. (If I'm a sub. If I'm the dom it would be you getting wet)\n-Tickling for a certain period of time. If you move at all it continues.\n-Take a cold shower or sit in cold water for a certain amount of time.\n\n(Funishments and rewards are short because these all depend on you and what you like but I still left some ideas)\n\nFunishments:\n-Being tied up and left (maybe with a vibrator on?).\n-Certain amount of days you aren't allowed to cum, or you can try to make me finish that many times. Of you succeed the punishment is avoided, if you don't the days are doubled.\n-Keep legs spread for a certain amount of time while I touch and tease. If they move or flinch I'll tie them down.\n\nRewards:\n-Permission to cum\n-Hugs, kisses, cuddling and verbal approval\n-Me hugging you tight while stroking your hair (if I'm a dom) or me sucking on breasts while you hold me (if I'm a sub). This can be very comforting for both people after an intense punishment.\n\nWhile you'll be my perfect slut, and I'll treat you as such, I'm very caring. I'll hold you to my chest at the end of the day and run my hands over you while dropping small kisses. You will always have aftercare and a shoulder to turn to. Safe words will always be respected and check ins regularly to make sure you're okay. I'll give you a massage and tell you how proud I am of you\/how much I appreciate you. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this. I know it's a lot but to have a clear understanding of everything is very important to me.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BDSMpersonals","subreddit_id":"t5_2smyd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BDSMpersonals","subreddit_subscribers":235207,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"20 [M4F] #Washington \/ #Online Switch looking for a connection (long post)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BDSMpersonals\/comments\/qk2jki\/20_m4f_washington_online_switch_looking_for_a\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

White, Ohio county with no confirmed rabies cases, no symptoms. Only existing but probably irrelevant condition is T1 diabetes.\n\nEarly 2019 I caught a small bat flying in our living room that got in through the covering on our chimney being worn away. I wasn't asleep, but was getting there, so I can't really say. I don't think I was bit, but I do know it's impossible to tell because of how small the bites are.\n\nI ended up carefully catching the bat in a container and throwing it outside. No physical contact was had with it. This was in a county with no documented rabies cases for a while, none in 2021 but I don't recall 2019. Since the animal is long gone it can not be tested, I had no place to save it and was doubtful I'd been bitten so it wasn't a concern.\n\nThis sort of lurks in the back of my mind, as I know treatment is necessary to prevent symptoms which indicate inevitable death. It's also expensive and I don't think I got bit...but don't want to die a painful death.\n\nEssentially, I've also read it can remain dormant but usually doesn't. I've read as long as seven years, and saw some talk of very rare cases being a couple decades, but had a hard time finding evidence based medical talk on those.\n\nAt the time, I was less worried about my health in general so to speak. I'm working on cleaning it up and however unlikely would hate to get hit with some dormant rabies in a few years when I'm otherwise healthier and getting my life together.\n\nHowever, I'm 2.5 years out.

I'm on mobile and english isnt my first language\n\nI have been married to my husband (30M) for a year and I am 31 weeks pregnant with our first baby. I had to quit my job in retail since the pregnancy is extremely hard on me and being on my feet all day was nearly impossible. From being a college student a year ago who also worked full time while maintaining a domestic relationship I have now become a full time stay at home wife, the opposite of the busy lifestyle I was used to. I feel like a completely different person, like I dont know myself. To compensate for me not working anymore my husband has taken more hours at his corporate job, leaving me fully by myself 10 hours a day 5-6 days a week. I didn't have any \"out of work\" friends and my dads are the only family I have and have their own jobs and lives. When my husband comes home he is understandibly tired, and me being huge and pregnant we have not had much room for intimacy or any couples activity really. We just eat dinner and then he falls asleep in front of the TV.\n\nI love my husband, and i appreachiate all the effort he puts in to make a living for us. But I am so lonely, and I cant help but feel like I am missing out on life.\n\nI started seeing a counselour (30-35M) as I showed some signs of depression and PTSD from some childhood events. A very good looking man and extremely charming and charismatic, a smile to die for and one of those golden radio voices that make you just melt. He is fit, has a great sense of style and smells good. He's the whole fucking package. All of that paired with the amazing conversation we have, for the first time in a long time I feel listened to, understood and empathized with. I know thats his job but it just lights something within me every time we have a session.\n\nThe thoughts began right away on my drive home from my first session, sexual thoughts and romantic fantasies, wich only grew stronger each and each session. I find myself thinking about him all day, wishing he was with me as I do household chores, imagining him around. Then my husband comes home and thats when the guilt comes in, like a huge rock in my stomach, I feel disgusted with myself. \n\nI know I should change counselours.

My husband did as well. We started with like the basic facesitting and him watching me dildo myself. We decided to have a bull fuck me and get freaky with it.\n\nThe bull we found was \"Mark.\" He was a big and tall black guy was a 9 inch cock. I never had someone that big. The first time was tough. I remember my husband playing with my hair and holding me I was almost crying taking Marks cock. \n\nWe have been with Mark for over 3 years. Trust me I am Pro at taking his cock now. My husband and I still fuck but Mark really hits deep. Mark 2 years ago started dating a white woman named \"Emma\" who actually liked him fucking other woman. We basically became a swinger couple with them. Except my husband mostly got pegged by Emma.\n\nMark and Emma got married like 8 months ago. Before they got married she found out she had major fertility issues. They both wanted a kid. One night the four of us decided I should surrogate for them. I always loved being pregnant and it would be a great match in many ways.\n\nMark got me pregnant after a few tries. I still remember crying and hugging Emma when I found out I was pregnant. Now I am 6 months along with their son.\n\nI get so much love and cuddles from my husband, Mark, and Emma. Being black bred is so hot. My husband eats me out almost daily.

Name's Isaak. Please read all the way before replying. It'd do wonders &lt;3  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So- How'd we get here:**  \n\n\nI've been thinking about relationships...  \nNever had a serious, healthy relationship, nor have i ever looked for one, but- I'm thinking maybe it's time for that to change.  \n\n\nI've always had the idea that i'm not good enough yet- I'd.. Grow for a bit as to be \"worthy\" within my own mind of the person i love.. I don't think i'm there yet. I've not... Grown sufficiently. But- Well- First of all, i'm not sure i'll be able to say when i have, and- Secondly... Why not grow \\*with\\* someone instead?  \n\n\nSo- Since i'm a huuuuge homebody who barely ever gets out- Here we are. I won't be meeting anyone IRL for some time, but i'd like to dip my feet in the water, so to speak. I'm 100% fine with a LDR (Long-Distance Relationship) with the right person so- Might as well!   \n\n\nI am looking for something more serious though. I'd like to hang out a bit- Having discord and some time for a movie\/game with me would be amazing for that. I don't want to rush into a \"hey stranger, are we dating now??\" so- Y'know, let's chat via the reddit chat thingy, see about adding eachother elsewhere if we click &lt;3  \n\n\nSo- That ramble out of the way-  \n\n\n**Who am i?** &gt;!Yelled Jackie Chan in 1998!&lt;\n\n  \nI'm Isaak! I'm 20, soon to be 21. I'm a pretty tall guy living in Belgium- Dutch being my first language.  \nI'm fairly lean- 194cm\/80kg (That's 6ft4\/180lb in freedom units). I've got some fairly long brown hair and far too crackable knuckles ever since i lost 25kg a year or 2 ago.  \n\n\nI'm a bit of a bear IRL-  Some peeps find me intimidating, although that disappears fairly soon after getting to know me &lt;3 Golden heart, really.  \n\n\nI'm amazing at finding the wonders in life- You'll find me going giddy over the first episode of the 3rd campaign of Critical Role which came out this monday on yt afhfhahffaHAFHAH- But- You'll also find me playing a melodramatic version of Chris Isaak's \"Wicked Game\" on my acoustic guitar some nights.  \n\n\nMusic wise- I'm mostly into blues-rock but it goes far beyond. I'm really into a particular acapella group called VoicePlay, i'm into a lot of pop-y stuff- Some punk rock, etc etc etc- Gotta love some nice cliché songs to dance to when i've got the house to myself as well ofc.  \n\n\nI- Am also a student. Trying to get my HS degree after hitting hurdle after hurdle after hurdle. My dream job afterwards would be something creative, preferrably also as geeky as voice acting- If that doesn't pan out after i take a swing at it, i'll likely go into something more psychology-ish, although it'd take me a loooong time to graduate, hurdles &amp; all that.  \n\n\n\\^\\^ This- Is often a deal-breaker, or so i've noticed. If it's an absolute deal-breaker to date someone who hasn't worked a day in his life, that's understandable. Not much to be done about that, but that's where we're at and i'm hopeful to move forward into what the world has to offer me with or without you.  \n\n\nBut! That's me! Or- Part of me atleast, there's more to me but you get the gist- Hmu for chapter 2 &lt;3  \n\n\n**Now, about you:**  \n\n\nYou- Can be absolutely anyone. You can be green, you can be mean, you can be violet sky, you can be helpful, you can be- You get the idea.. I don't really mind. I've got my preferences, ofcourse, but while i may love redhead irish lasses more than asian cutie pies- If you manage to capture my soul i won't care whether your heart-thief lookin' ass is black, white or- Y'know. Just- Capture my soul, 2head.  \n\n\nUhm- I'd prefer it if you're closer to my age. 19\/20\/21\/22- Not... As necessary? You can be 23\/18, but i'd prefer it if you're in a similar stage of life as me.  \n\n\nIf you're emotionally mature? God, say no more just message me already.  \n\n\nI do prefer someone who's easy-going &amp; a romantic though. I- think i might be a sucker for cutesie shit. Y'know- Like- Cute stuff. I'm- Absolutely the kind of guy who would just LOVE saying yes to your proposal as you're on your knees shoving that mcdonald's toy ring on my finger to take me as your +1 to a concert of some kind.  \n\n\nBut- Honestly? Idrc what your labels are. Just- Be female? It's.. Tough for me to feel anything sexually for a man sadly, otherwise tom hardy'd be getting it rn, but- Yeah, just be female. Tattoos or no tattoos. Christian virgin pressured by family to stay in the closet about listening to punk-rock and eating snacks after bed-time. Tomboy with a fear of abandonment who finds it so so tough to speak out those 3 words in case i won't say them back. Perhaps a fiery young woman on her way to being the best doctor on the continent. Whatever it is you are, if i sound like a good time, then come take a closer look, promise i won't bite yet &lt;3  \n\n\nAnother thing though- Don't- I'd like it if you're capable of listening. I've spent a lot of my life with family members who cannot for the life of them listen. I don't want to date that person. I want to date someone who listens to what i have to say. The kind of person who- when i struggle to say what i have to say, will actively try to understand what i am trying to say. Not the kind of person who'll prioritise yelling her \"defense\" at me after i've tried listening to and understanding you for an hour.  \n\n\n\\-----------------  \n\n\nSo: I'm- Getting a tad tired. It's very late here. Gotta go to sleep so the monster under my bed can go get his halloween &lt;3 Please feel free to gimme a shout if i seem at all interesting and i promise to respond as soon as i can. Night folks!

No idea \"mandated reporting\" was even a thing until my 30's, actually the backlash of the unintended court case, while I was 1000+ miles away, was more traumatizing than the actual mdsa...), but it was the late 90's and there was no definition of \"covert incest\". (I also experienced the \"emotional incest\" stuff but that doesn't count in this community because it was...uhh...just parentified toddler\/enmeshment throughout childhood type stuff? Which is still NOT OK but it's emotional abuse not sexual abuse of any kind.) I don't even know if \"covert mother-daughter incest\" is a definition that's legally reportable now or one that is circulated mainly in (don't mean that in a minimizing sense, at least not for the rest of you, I myself was basically psychologically brainwashed out of even believing it was abuse of any kind throughout my later teens and well into my mid-late 30's. Btw I'm 38 now.) So genuinely asking here. I'm a part in a DID system, so obviously much more likely went on, and likely with non-family members (men specifically), as well as a bunch of other trauma\/abuse, none of that stuff belongs in this community, though.\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING for the following:** \n\nOk so progressive families in general are known for often teaching very young children the mechanics of heterosexual sex, the anatomical names for their body parts and those of the sexual organs they themselves do not have. (I'm not intersex nor was I born so--it's a completely valid identity, however I can't speak to how progressive families of intersex children may approach teaching intersex children.)\n\nHowever my own family of origin was fairly extreme in it's countercultural identity and also fairly cult-like, particularly in the \"narrative\" that \"we are the only family that does things right, we never make mistakes, and anyone who differs from us in any way whatsoever is \"wrong\" aka \"making bad choices\" aka \"bad parenting\" aka in a 3 year old's naturally black-and-white interpretation, bad\/evil. So I have literally zero idea what a \"good enough\/healthy enough\" progressive family does. You'll see how this applies in a couple seconds.\n\nSO yeah, my mother taught me the intricacies of the mechanics of sex basically as soon as I asked where babies come from, definitely by\/around age 3, including defining and describing orgasms (using that word) and that \"they feel good, and you get really excited\" (as close to exact words as I can remember 35 years later with diagnosed DID\/CPTSD.) She also showed me very graphic (bloody as all heck, literally bloody) photos of my own birth at the same general age, as well as telling me that it was so bloody because I \"tore her\" (aka she refused an episiotomy). Edit: I felt guilty for \"tearing her\" for years.\n\n**OK MASSIVE TRIGGER WARNING** (however I'm pretty sure nobody's actually weird enough to do this besides my mother, please lmk if I'm wrong?!)\n\nShe also taught me about menses at that age. As in not only did she describe them in complete and total graphic detail,  including visual and tactile aids. (This was the 80's when they still sold those hospital style sanitary napkins, that use the belt that goes around your waist and you pull the little paper tab through the little metal thingie that hangs down...I genuinely do not know if this was a thing or if she just made up the belt thing, because I was 3, 4, 5, maybe even 6 by the time it stopped? Those hospital style napkins were what she always wore, any time we were out in public and she couldn't really carry around a bunch of stinky used cloth napkins to bring home and wash and reuse. That's what she wore at home. They also I believe must have used the same type of belt although that part is just fuzzy darkness in my mind.) So basically both in public restrooms with the disposable ones and in our own bathroom at home, it was...for some reason...my assigned job to attach said napkins to the belt...I'm not sure if \"my job\" was to attach it in front *and* back, or if she did it herself in back--because obviously they're just suspended between your legs, they don't stick to your underwear, so they have to be attached to the belt in both front and back. Anyway it did NOT involve touching her actual private parts aka the \"g\" word, but it was basically impossible to do that without touching her hairy whatever part in some way. Which is pretty inappropriate and uncalled for and basically if you're not incapacitated you should be doing it your own self. Basically anything to do with periods including the word \"period\" is triggering and I felt as a small child who likely had already been assaulted\/abused by at least one man if not repeatedly by a second (hypothetical!) like I was an abuser who had abused my own mother.\n\nOk there's a whole bunch more but it's from later on so I'll leave it there for now before I lose my freaking mind.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"mdsa","subreddit_id":"t5_9khmz","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/mdsa","subreddit_subscribers":1841,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"TRIGGER WARNING!: Uhh DID system here called The Pi System been lurking\/only commenting a couple times?

Name's Isaak. Please read all the way before replying. It'd do wonders &lt;3  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So- How'd we get here:**  \n\n\nI've been thinking about relationships...  \nNever had a serious, healthy relationship, nor have i ever looked for one, but- I'm thinking maybe it's time for that to change.\n\nI've always had the idea that i'm not good enough yet- I'd.. Grow for a bit as to be \"worthy\" within my own mind of the person i love.. I don't think i'm there yet. I've not... Grown sufficiently. But- Well- First of all, i'm not sure i'll be able to say when i have, and- Secondly... Why not grow \\*with\\* someone instead?\n\nSo- Since i'm a huuuuge homebody who barely ever gets out- Here we are. I won't be meeting anyone IRL for some time, but i'd like to dip my feet in the water, so to speak. I'm 100% fine with a LDR (Long-Distance Relationship) with the right person so- Might as well!\n\nI am looking for something more serious though. I'd like to hang out a bit- Having discord and some time for a movie\/game with me would be amazing for that. I don't want to rush into a \"hey stranger, are we dating now??\" so- Y'know, let's chat via the reddit chat thingy, see about adding eachother elsewhere if we click &lt;3\n\nSo- That ramble out of the way-  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Who am i?** &gt;!Yelled Jackie Chan in 1998!&lt;  \n\n\nI'm Isaak! I'm 20, soon to be 21. I'm a pretty tall guy living in Belgium- Dutch being my first language.  \nI'm fairly lean- 194cm\/80kg (That's 6ft4\/180lb in freedom units). I've got some fairly long brown hair and far too crackable knuckles ever since i lost 25kg a year or 2 ago.\n\nI'm a bit of a bear IRL- Some peeps find me intimidating, although that disappears fairly soon after getting to know me &lt;3 Golden heart, really.\n\nI'm amazing at finding the wonders in life- You'll find me going giddy over the first episode of the 3rd campaign of Critical Role which came out this monday on yt afhfhahffaHAFHAH- But- You'll also find me playing a melodramatic version of Chris Isaak's \"Wicked Game\" on my acoustic guitar some nights.\n\nMusic wise- I'm mostly into blues-rock but it goes far beyond. I'm really into a particular acapella group called VoicePlay, i'm into a lot of pop-y stuff- Some punk rock, etc etc etc- Gotta love some nice cliché songs to dance to when i've got the house to myself as well ofc.\n\nI- Am also a student. Trying to get my HS degree after hitting hurdle after hurdle after hurdle. My dream job afterwards would be something creative, preferrably also as geeky as voice acting- If that doesn't pan out after i take a swing at it, i'll likely go into something more psychology-ish, although it'd take me a loooong time to graduate, hurdles &amp; all that.\n\n\\^\\^ This- Is often a deal-breaker, or so i've noticed. If it's an absolute deal-breaker to date someone who hasn't worked a day in his life, that's understandable. Not much to be done about that, but that's where we're at and i'm hopeful to move forward into what the world has to offer me with or without you.\n\nBut! That's me! Or- Part of me atleast, there's more to me but you get the gist- Hmu for chapter 2 &lt;3  \n\n\n**Now, about you:**\n\nYou- Can be absolutely anyone. You can be green, you can be mean, you can be violet sky, you can be helpful, you can be- You get the idea.. I don't really mind. I've got my preferences, ofcourse, but while i may love redhead irish lasses more than asian cutie pies- If you manage to capture my soul i won't care whether your heart-thief lookin' ass is black, white or- Y'know. Just- Capture my soul, 2head.\n\nUhm- I'd prefer it if you're closer to my age. 19\/20\/21\/22- Not... As necessary? You can be 23\/18, but i'd prefer it if you're in a similar stage of life as me.\n\nIf you're emotionally mature? God, say no more just message me already.\n\nI do prefer someone who's easy-going &amp; a romantic though. I- think i might be a sucker for cutesie shit. Y'know- Like- Cute stuff. I'm- Absolutely the kind of guy who would just LOVE saying yes to your proposal as you're on your knees shoving that mcdonald's toy ring on my finger to take me as your +1 to a concert of some kind.\n\nBut- Honestly? Idrc what your labels are. Just- Be female? It's.. Tough for me to feel anything sexually for a man sadly, otherwise tom hardy'd be getting it rn, but- Yeah, just be female. Tattoos or no tattoos. Christian virgin pressured by family to stay in the closet about listening to punk-rock and eating snacks after bed-time. Tomboy with a fear of abandonment who finds it so so tough to speak out those 3 words in case i won't say them back. Perhaps a fiery young woman on her way to being the best doctor on the continent. Whatever it is you are, if i sound like a good time, then come take a closer look, promise i won't bite yet &lt;3\n\nAnother thing though- I'd like it if you're capable of listening. I've spent a lot of my life with family members who cannot for the life of them listen. I don't want to date that person. I want to date someone who listens to what i have to say. The kind of person who- when i struggle to say what i have to say, will actively try to understand what i am trying to say. Not the kind of person who'll prioritise yelling her \"defense\" at me after i've tried listening to and understanding you for an hour.\n\n\\-----------------\n\nSo: I'm- Getting a tad tired. It's very late here.

I am 15 years old and Asian-American (Filipino) and I just want to vent no matter what. So I have been undergoing issues whether it's my mental health or not. I've vented on support subreddits before but I just thought it would be okay to vent here, and asked God as well if it's okay. \n\nSo I was homeschooled for my freshman year of high school due to COVID-19 and other personal reasons. I hated it so much and wanted to stop, and I struggled with anxiety issues as well as depression. To give you a bit more context, I was bullied severely during middle school. Jumped, harassed, cyberbullied, and made fun of. I went to a public middle school in 6th grade then transferred to a private catholic middle school through 7th-8th grade. It was horrible, but still a bit better than my current situation and would rather go back in time to live in those moments than to endure a current hellhole I'm undergoing. So last February, I tried talking to my parents about what's bothering me and all and tried to convince my parents to take me to therapy, and I hoped that they would comfort me because I had no other choice. I was bawling my eyes out and my dad was yelling at me, threatening to hit me physically. He then tried to \"comfort\" me, but get this. He kept talking to me, and now that I think about it, he was the one acting passive-aggressive to me, since my parents keep calling me names such as emo, spoiled, entitled, ungrateful, problem-child, and a selfish, self-centered mess etc. He took away one of my social media platforms since he thought it was \"corrupt\" and \"twisting my mind\" when we had that talk back then. And he also said, \"you know (don't want to give away my name), I need help too.\" And I thought to myself, \"HECK YEAH YOU DO.\" A few months later, a few days before I completed my homeschooling, I tried to get into a public school that is not in our district. I didn't get in when I received the news last month that the classrooms were full (I'll talk about that later), but here goes right now, bear with me with this EXTREMELY long post.\n\nSo right now I am in a small school, my parents thought this would be a good alternative to the school I wanted to go to which was not in our district, but my parents still tried to enroll me to the school so I would shut up for once (they didn't tell me they tried). \n\nDuring the summer, I went to Chicago alone to spend time with my aunt and uncle. My parents agreed luckily with my aunt and uncle. It was fun and relaxing there and did many things with them that I look back on, I even vented to my uncle as well and he listened to me without getting mad, unlike my aunt, well... I even find my uncle as a father figure more than my dad which sounds wrong and I'm assuming my dad knows as well because my dad LITERALLY knows everything about me which I accept, but it doesn't give him and my mom the right to act emotionally and verbally abusive towards me and my little brothers. But anyways while I was there, I was looking forward to the small private \"affordable\" school thinking that maybe I should stop obsessing over the out-of-district public school and focus on this one which I did. They claimed to be a college-prep school as well as a go at your own pace one which I thought was a big plus because college is right around the corner and homeschooling kind of messed me up. \n\nAs soon as I got in that school, it was FAR from what I imagined it to be. You usually forget what you learned in this school just like in a public setting, and you can literally get away with anything here because everyone in my class sneaks their phones in all the time and I am the only one who gives my phone to the teacher because I believe in strong integrity whether it's my faith in God or not, because I even told my parents the truth about me cheating throughout my homeschool. The school lunch is absolutely terrible, and I only order food on Fridays because we order pizza all the time. The white kids act like they're gangsters, the seniors like in public schools act like they're at the top, the kids call me out on every move I do whether it's wrong or not, but because it's \"weird\" to them, and we have snitches too. We only have 4 kids in my grade (10th grade), and I don't like dealing with the younger kids who are immature and talk wayyy too much. Remember I said everyone sneaks their phones in except me? Well they always tell the teacher they have to go to the bathroom and he doesn't question it, and lets them off the hook. While they are in the restrooms, they pull out their phones and do whatever. But hey, I don't want to snitch because well... In this school, WE HAVE NO EXTRACURRICULARS AT ALL. Though I am glad that I studied and worked my butt off and passed every test here in this school. I know God commanded us to love one another and treat them the way they want to be treated, but I am just here to vent my frustrations. I don't hate the kids themselves, but I hate the way they act. I only have two friends here, and I don't talk to the rest and just leave them be. At this school, my friend tells me that almost EVERYONE leaves this school at some point without graduating here and that's what I'm planning to do. And the ones that do make it do not ever come back to this school to visit ONCE. The school I'm zoned to is the WORST in the south bay area which I live in. It's known to be extremely ghetto. My bullies from middle school even told me to go there just so they could watch me get bullied. At first I did not take it seriously, but now that I found out I live in the area, I am panicking and upset that my bullies might win as well as me getting hurt there. It's also known to have horrible teachers as well. But anyways, I'll carry on, get mad at me if you want, I don't care if I sound like a spoiled brat anymore according to my parents. \n\nSo yeah, the reason I got into a relationship with God is because I thought it was the missing piece of the puzzle. When I had to endure months of mental stress and confusion, I thought of going to God because I was a lukewarm Christian\/Catholic back then and I didn't put Him first in my life unlike now. Now I talk to Him every day, I pray without ceasing, and I told him EVERYTHING. I mean EVERYTHING about me and about my situation big or small and in general. More than I probably typed in this post. I vent to Him and cry to Him and I read a few pages of the Bible every day. I finished the Book of Matthew and enjoyed it a lot. Now I'm reading the Book of Job because people told others who are going through a hard time to read it, and I still enjoy it as much as the Book of Matthew. I devoted myself to loving God and talking to Him as a friend and telling Him whatever is on my mind. \n\nEvery time I try talking to my parents, it gets harder and harder because my parents keep punishing me and they yell at me in front of my brothers who don't deserve to hear the very words out of their mouths. Like many toxic parents, they use tricks. And I now know the whole situation of me and my parents, like everything. Whether I'm the one at fault or not. My parents say they're imperfect, but when I try to be honest with them, they get set off thinking that it's beyond what they expected. And correlating to that, my parents act like they validate me, but when one word comes out of my mouth, they get upset and punish me by taking my phone a lot. I can tell they're scared and we can't communicate effectively. They even have the excuse of them being stressed out, thinking they could get a pass with what they're saying to me. They act like me and my brothers owe them something for raising them, and they tell me I should be lucky and learn to be happy and man the f\\*ck up (excuse me). They even get extremely mad at the smallest things I do. Like you could be the perfect child or meet their expectations, and they will always have something to say. I try not to set them off or anything but they make the smallest things a big deal. I cannot reason out with them anymore and they say I'm the one who is passive-aggressive and abusive. They straight up TOLD ME THAT. They told me I'm gaslighting them and that I am entitled. They tell me I'm selfish and that I don't think about them. My parents always put their needs first now that I think about it. I may be at fault here, but I'm just pointing out what I notice with my parents because I felt something wasn't right. My parents tell me to be situationally aware even though I make mistakes and fall sometimes, but use that excuse without even teaching me how to be situationally aware. \n\nFor example, this morning my dad woke me up on the phone telling me to do something with my email since something is wrong which I won't be specific about. But after that, my dad told me to get the recycling bottles from the patio. Which I did and put it on the cart. But then I went upstairs and I did not know my dad was telling me to put it in the car. Then my dad called me and told me to put on my car and yelled at me so bad. So I put it in the car and as I was about to leave and as he was about to leave for his business work, he told me that I am selfish, entitled, and that I don't think about them but myself. I told him I was sorry and that I make mistakes sometimes. He denied it and told me to be more situationally aware. He told me things about what I did last last Friday when I was at a theme park with my friends late at night. From that, I knew he was wrong and resorted to tricks like telling me about that one mistake I did at the theme park. He never told me anything like this before unlike my mom who would constantly remind me of every little mistake I did. But I'm guessing my dad knew he was in the wrong and resorted to cheap little tricks. I even prayed to God about this as well, and asked if venting in this subreddit was a good idea. Because people in other support groups tell me that my situation is impossible, and that was BEFORE I talked to God and started maintaining a relationship with him a month later. And about theme parks, I remember in Chicago I was at a rollercoaster one with my other friends I made there and I embarrassed myself a lot there (don't want to talk about that), and my uncle said I was just being myself. I'm also upset that I can't talk to him at all because he got busier and busier and I have to talk to my aunt now asking her how she is doing. About Chicago, I was thinking of moving there because I am zoned to a bad school and want to get out of my current one the first day of school. I planned that out for one month straight and failed miserably and got punished for it. I tried talking to my parents about how I don't like this school and think that moving to Chicago may be a good option. But my dad said, \"WOW! YOU DON'T LOVE US!\" And I was like I didn't mean that dad. But anyways, my phone and laptop got taken away, supposedly permanently, and I prayed to God for giving me back my phone and computer. Which he did during the weekend and I thanked Him so much for it. \n\nAnyways I have a little bit more to say and then I'm done, just bear with me. My situation is unique compared to others who have lost their loved ones, went through depression at some point, or is undergoing suicide. My aunts (my mom's sisters) were arguing with my mom and dad and yelling at them. I didn't know what it was about and my uncle didn't as well. But my uncle said it was not my fault no matter what. But what I did know is my aunts forced my parents to get me a counselor which my parents fortunately did like THANK YOU GOD SO MUCH. But my parents had to find ones through our insurance and I was referred out-of-network. I talked to some of the counselors and they were condescending and rude towards me and never listened. From that, I now have episodes of suicide and still do to this day which I try to prevent. But please pray that I get lucky with the counselors, and I pray for those who are going through every tough time there is. We also have lots and lots of money because we have businesses with physical therapy. HECK, my parents said they could afford a porsche and a house up in the hills in just a year or less. But I'm also praying for this school that I found. I've been to it before because of my middle school mass field trip. At first they were advertising it in our middle school and I didn't take it seriously then. But when I toured the school, I was completely wrong. I am also assuming that this business is God's answer and He is working towards what I asked for but he probably also said no to what I planned for myself with the out-of-district school and moving to Chicago because I couldn't take it here. With the school out of our district, God probably said no because my best friend moved out of that school and went somewhere else. So THANK YOU GOD FOR TELLING ME AT LEAST WHETHER IT WAS A NO OR NOT. The private school I want to go to is a little expensive, but it is a college prep one and they accept everyone there and is EXTREMELY diverse and every teachers are good and dedicated since I talked to them. But I'm just concerned about the space availability there because I got denied from the other school since it was so full. But please pray that I get into that school. Though I am ashamed that I sound like an entitled brat when I talk about this school, I am glad I was honest and I got this all off my chest. Is God telling me to wait? I wonder every day what God is telling me even though I read the Bible. Is God mad at me for telling Him everything whether it's disturbing or not? Is God telling me to just endure my time here at this school? I pray I pray I pray. I also notice that God only answers my small prayers which I am thankful for, but not the big ones. I feel like you guys are going to get  mad at me, even God might be mad even though I try to love Him and maintain a relationship with Him as well as improving every day and getting wiser. But nonetheless, I thank God for letting me be honest here even if He probably was against me venting here. Thank you for reading and Happy Halloween I guess..\n\nEDIT: To add, I also dedicated myself to God because things that require skill aren’t my thing and I wasn’t interested in piano or chess. So I talk to God and read the Bible at my own pace and enjoy it a lot.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TrueChristian","subreddit_id":"t5_2u489","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TrueChristian","subreddit_subscribers":75440,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Maintaining faith and a relationship with God during my struggles.

Right now I'm 8 Barb, 2 Pal. I'd like to take 1 more Barb, but I also want to take 2 more of Pal for Oath and Feat (Great Weapon Master) first.\n\nMy question is, what Oath you guys think I should take? Storywise we play that my character so far felt 'the calling' and we're working on how to incorporate it with the DM, so pretty much all options (Aside from Oathbreaker) are valid, some would be more in character but I don't want to put a whole character profile here. If you know any good UA or HB, I might ask my DM about those as well.\n\nAlso any other ideas you think would work with this build? I don't have the exact cap, but the DM said that the campaign should go to about Lv 15, so how would you recommend me spread my stuff?

A few weeks ago I did a dive to Ginnie, and was forced to turn on gas before even hitting Hill 400, she really kicked my butt.\n\nNow not uncommon solution is to grab a stage, bigger tanks, a DPV, or all three at once. But I knew that I can go at least 1,000 feet on my LP85s. And thinking I realized that I don't really know Ginnie. I followed the route that my instructors showed me to get through the gallery, but I didn't realize why we took that specific route, because I didn't know Ginnie. \n\nSure I knew the basics of \"Sticking close to the inside wall, and to stay high,\" but that is general rules that doesn't always translate over to finding the best pull points, in a huge room like the gallery that most people are transiting quickly to get to the \"interesting\" parts of the cave. So my solution, spend about 4 hours across three dives, just in the Gallery, from the eye to the lips go back, and repeat until I hit a rock bottom pressure I set.\n\nThere were \"Ah hah\" moments where I think I got it, only to realize, \"Hey wait here is a better idea.\" It allowed me really to soak up each area and know them. But best of all it allowed me to take in the gallery, I could sit at the various calm areas of the gallery, and just look around and appreciate that I am 60 feet underwater in a cave room large enough to drive a tractor trailer through. Sure that that isn't as impressive as the hanger sized rooms of Nohoch, and the 180 feet deep ball room of the Nest. But this is in the first 300 feet that anyone with an Intro Cert can visit.\n\nI also realized I need a lot more video lights, I want to light up the gallery and take a video of just that float back to the Ear. And that I should do this again just for kicks, an hour with no goals, no expectations, just me and this amazing room.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"scuba","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhii","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/scuba","subreddit_subscribers":126694,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Software solutions to software problems - How I learned to stop worrying and love the flow...","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.79,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/scuba\/comments\/qk3eir\/software_solutions_to_software_problems_how_i\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I'm more confused now than I was when I was 23.\n\nHow do I explain... OK so I see a woman right, she looks amazing, maybe even tonite I kissed said woman, I was even crushing on her for a few weeks, I even know her from work and think she is gorgeous. We kiss and... nothing... i get a little aroused but like..  OK..  I can barely hold a convo with her, I dunno what to talk about or say or anything. I admire her though, she talks about her life a bit and I'm pretty sure I came off as confused to her as I am in my own head. So she's probably disappointed or whatever. Nothing I can do.\n\nNext minute, a dude beside me starts joking with me and he's cute as shit but straight and I immediately click with him. I find it so natural, so comfortable to just play with men, to giggle or even flirt (albeit this guy had a GF so obvs I wasn't going to try).  But still, it felt like everything was ok.. I could just be me...\n\nAnd I just..  I don't know, I see guys and think oh yea he's  hot but no way would he go for a bear like me.. or she looks gorgeous and I think..  ok that's a really gay way to describe a woman. I watch both men and women p0rn and both types excite me..\n\nBut I just.. I can't understand it. I'm 25, thicc like a bear. Single, never dated.

I'm a 29F and single, and have been for years, by choice. The main reason is I felt like I wasn't enough for someone else, and have been working on myself. I returned to school and finish my degree in December, and have been interviewing left and right. However, once I have the career I've always wanted, I don't feel the need to go and get \"wifed\" up immediately. \n\nWhy is it WEIRD that I don't want to be in a relationship? Like why is this so frowned down upon? Why is it so engrained in our society that we need a man to be complete? First of all, I'm not even 100% positive I'm straight. Second of all, no matter if I end up with a man or a woman, I don't need someone else to be complete. Why am I viewed as such an outlier since I'm choosing to not meet people and trying to start a relationship? I cannot wrap my head around this.\n\nThe people who are on me for it, are the ones who have been in long term relationships. I've been told I'll learn to love myself more when I find someone who loves me for me. Like why? What about self love? Why do I need someone else. I don't understand this, and it honestly makes me irrationally angry. Maybe since I've never been in a \"serious\" relationship? I'm not sure, but I cannot comprehend how dating someone will make me feel more \"complete\" and like I've finally reached a \"milestone.\"\n\nFurther piggybacking off of this, KIDS. Like no, I'm not going to change my mind. I'm 29, I've never wanted kids and newsflash, I still don't. I can recognize cute kids, and I actually get on with kids quite well. However, I don't have that maternal instinct and I never see that in my future. This is probably another part of my reasoning for not feeling this feeling of \"doom\" and like I need to find a partner ASAP. My ovaries can dry out, I couldn't care less. \n\nI'm so sick and tired of these societal norms and people constantly trying to push their narrative on me. Why can't people just accept that I am happy enough single, and maybe the right one will come along one day, but I don't need to spend every day looking for them. Also, I cannot even begin to imagine what my life will look like when I do get serious with someone and I continue to say I'm not having kids. The pressure will only get worse then. And one more last thought, good luck to me finding a man who doesn't want to pass on his genes.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TwoXChromosomes","subreddit_id":"t5_2r2jt","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TwoXChromosomes","subreddit_subscribers":13385603,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Getting so sick and tired of people telling me I need to find someone to date and I will eventually change my mind about wanting children.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.78,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/qk3go2\/getting_so_sick_and_tired_of_people_telling_me_i\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

A short into to my I’m a massive anime and video game nerd, a Japanese enthusiast. This is vanilla me. I have my beautiful wife, I am married we are Poly and have been for two years. I work at a bank have a steady job. Ask me about anime, pc games like LOL or mobile games.\n\nAs for kink, the way our poly works is that  I’m open and honest with my wife about everything. She provides all the wife and home\/vanilla feelings I need. I am 21 years of age soon to be 22.\n\nI’m looking for a sub, who will adhere to medium strict rules. The sub I’m looking for will earn my trust and respect before a relationship is started, likewise I should earn your as well. I am looking for someone who can take lots of pain, preferably a pain slut. My sub would crave pain and beg for it. Would love to be abused every time we meet. They would idolize me after it’s earned. Put me on a pedestal so to speak. Be open to trying some tougher stuff later on the line. Such as piss play or possibly scat. I want to fulfill some nasty desires. You will need to have a personality, I do not want a lifeless doll. Be willing to learn as you go and improve behaviors based on my guidance. If and when you fail receive punishment that’s agreed upon before any contract is signed. Know your place below me at my feet and feel enthusiastic about being whatever I want you to be.be it slut, anal whore, blowjob cumdumpster, a hole to be used after a day of work, my sweet bottom who takes it like a champ and begs for more pain. I’m looking for a sub\/slave that will 100% and will be willing to receive 100% of what I have to give. I want someone I can build a relationship with. Someone who has their own life and problems. Who is stable and not childish but can still laugh and love. \n\nMy love is not split 50\/50 it’s 200% my wife does not like to know a lot of details but will ask from time to time what we’re doing. Be sure you are okay with me disclosing info to her. \n\nBe comfortable talking about red flags and trauma if any, things that could cause issues during play. Help keep me in line staying within preordained boundaries. As to play safely. Aftercare is very important after scenes and it’s highly encouraged. Aftercare should be agreed-upon before a relationship\/contract is started but can be improvised later on down the line. I have been into kink for 7 years and actively prancing for two at first with my wife then other submissives. Or pick up play at the local dungeon. I have toys and experience, I no longer see my wife as a submissive and have swapped over to a more wifey role with much less kink. Hence why I’m looking for a Sub\/Slave\n\nWhat I’m asking for is specific and non negotiable please do not msg if you can not fulfill this role. The dynamic is not 24\/7 it will be in person and over text\/calls. We do not have to be public and can remain private. Be open to going to the local BDSM scene here in Alabama at The Red Chair. You can PM and ask for pics. (I rock the Viking look on the larger side with broad shoulders and a shorter beard. Blond hair brown eyes. 5,9 height) Very into short girls. Online at first for a time then meeting later when comfortable.

So I did take them out to theme parks, the zoo, restaurants ...etc\n\nSo with our trips I got to know her sister (who's the same age as me) and I really liked her personality, the way she dresses, her appearance, and most importantly her religion.\nI'm not sure how she thinks of me tho, we haven't talked much, but I hope she has some feelings towards me.\n\nMy mother already told me that her family won't let her get married until she graduates (Which is good news to me so I could get better prepared financially), but I'm really worried that I might get rejected or smth or it might just be weird for us two siblings to be marrying two sisters of the same family.\nI still haven't talked about what I think to either my mother or my brother's wife (obviously)\n\n\nAnd btw during their stay I established a very good relationship with her mother, and her mother knows that we are a good family, so I'm hoping her mother won't have a problem with me.\n\nSomethings to add:\n\n-She needs 2 more years to graduate, while I need 3     (1 year late due to prep year)\n\n-If we get married, she would have to move to my country (same as her sister), so she would leave her family behind (I'm really worried about this point because she might wanna stay and reject me because of that)\n\n\nAnother question, when do u think is the right time to open this topic up to my mother? I'm thinking after I get a stable job, even though working while being a dentistry student is very hard (Jobs are mostly full time; require a graduate), but I will try my best\n\nAnd btw my father has been murdered long ago, so that's why I only mentioned my mother.\n\nThank you, and I hope to hear some responses from you!\n\nEdit: formatting","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MuslimMarriage","subreddit_id":"t5_39x1d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/MuslimMarriage","subreddit_subscribers":35367,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Is it ok to marry a girl from the same family as my brother's wife?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.97,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MuslimMarriage\/comments\/qk3k2v\/is_it_ok_to_marry_a_girl_from_the_same_family_as\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

It was the scariest fucking time in my life.. I literally got PTSD from everything that was going on and it fucked me up for a while.. took a long time to work through all the shit I had on my plate.\n\nSo my business had been falling apart for a while and more of my time and energy was spent focused on using and trying not to feel sick everyday.. I was taking extended release hydro's from my sibling who has a script, percs, or any pills I could get my hands on.. never injected I've always been afraid of needles and a bit naive about my addictions..\n\nI always felt like shit everyday but convinced myself I didn't have a problem until things came crashing down one day. I owned two large dogs (male &amp; female) and one day they got into a squabble at feeding time.. 100% due to my lack of spending time with them, burning their energy and my own nervous stressed energy from daily wd's. Regardless, my body couldn't recover from it.. something inside me broke and I spiraled into a pit of fear and panic. My resting heart rate was over 130 BPM  just sitting down trying to get control of myself.\n\nSo typically i'd go for a fix but for some reason I went to my parents instead and said I needed to get some help.. I wanted to get, well honestly I just didn't want to feel so scared and broken and I didn't know what I needed. I just knew that if I chose to keep using I was going to die.\n\nSo I went to rehab.. lasted a little over a week (was a 30-45 day program) and I left. Rehab honestly just made my fear and panic so much worse and thats when I realized I had some serious mental issues I needed to work through. I was never diagnosed but i definitely had SEVERE depression, what felt like constant panic attacks ( I went to the ER at rehab because my heart rate wouldn't go down and I thought I was going to die) anxiety, and horrible acid reflux which left my chest and throat constantly burning and aching. My chest hurt so much from my heart constantly racing and being drenched in stomach acid but I had no idea what was going on, it just scared the shit out of me so I left rehab.\n\nLeaving was the best decision. The second I left I felt a weight lift, a tiny weight but it was a start. And the start I needed to get me where I am today.\n\nI feel like im going on and my brains going to mush right now. I'll add more later.\n\nI was only taking about 3-4x 4mg pills a day. when I got to rehab i was told i was going to be put on sub but ended up going cold turkey, i think they gave me a gabapentin on the first night and that was it.\n\nI left rehab and had to take a flight back home to my disappointed parents who had also told our church community that I was going to rehab ( my family is heavily religious).. so that sucked but I knew i wanted to get clean and I had the best intentions.\n\nI went about 4 months clean and ended up using one night because i was just sick of feeling like shit and depressed and I just really wanted to use. I used for the next couple weeks because it took away all the shit I had been feeling for the past months and helped me to start working through what I went through instead of running from it. After a couple weeks i decided to give quitting another go. I lasted about a week and then used the next weekend because it was the weekend...\n\nI carried on like this from about November 2019 - July 2021. Quitting for a couple weeks at most, using for a week\/end and then restarting. I figured, at worst im getting my body used to the acute wd's and a little paws, so when I truly want to quit it won't be so bad and I know what I'm going through. But everytime I felt so disappointed in myself for using, like if I didn't use the last time, id be a month clean. And everytime I relapse I'd lose the progress I'd made, lose my appetite\/weight and be a douche to anyone around me..\n\nJuly I decided to quit for good. I did good for a month and 3 weeks and relapsed on a saturday after feeling great all day.. But then there was a moment after dinner where I was dehydrated and felt like shit and because of how I felt I relapsed.. I sat there with a pill for half an hour debating whether or not to take it and convinced myself to do it. Stupid.. Threw away almost 2 months for nothing. Usually I'd use again the next night to \"make it worth it\" and then restart.. but I was so sick of myself I couldn't.\n\nSo I restarted and now ive been clean for 42 days and I feel like I have it in me to truly stay clean for good. I'm sick of the addiction and I want a life, I want to start a family. I'm turning 30 next month and Im so excited for my birthday; I'm actually sober and I don't have to worry about waking up with those demons ruling my days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"opiates","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0y3","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/opiates","subreddit_subscribers":165541,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"42 Days clean","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.71,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/qk3mjs\/42_days_clean\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Others are far more deserving of love and attention than I am. I guess I just wanted to get it out there. Finally, open up.\n\nI've been wishing I was dead since I was 15. Like everyone I thought it was just a phase. Then those thoughts never left me. They made me depressed as they went from being an every other week thing to everyday. I fell into a depression at 18 that lasted for years.\n\nIt became crippling at 20. Suicide was the only thing on my mind every day. \n\nUntil about 21 when I finally suddenly out of fucking nowhere got the strength to try again. I started exercising and working a job. My interest in everything returned. I felt human again for what felt like the first time in years.\n\nThen\n\nI was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder II at the age of 22. I'm 24 now and I spent so long trying to prove the doctor and psychiatrist wrong. Even when it finally explained everything in my life. The mood swings. The depression without a trigger. The sudden weeks or solid month of productivity then back to depression. The constant thoughts of wishing I was dead. But I wanted to just be depressed. Ya know? Something I could fix with exercise and therapy. \n\nI avoided medication and refused to do any more research about my diagnosis as the more I looked the more it made sense and I didn't like that. It hurt every time I saw yet another symptom that fit me to a T.\n\n\nMy family has always been very inconsiderate of mental illness so I didn't want it to be true. I didn't want to be anymore of a burden to my family than I already am as I tried to get my young adult life together.\n\nThen 3 weeks ago from now it hit me. The crash after a long lasting high.\n\nI went from being in the best shape of my life. Running 6-12 miles a day everyday. Working a good manual labor job. Lifting heavy weights 5 days a week. Constantly moving and being productive and making good savings to finally move out, to with in one night being unable to even get out of bed.\n\nI never even realized it. I was hypomanic and just thought I was finally getting my shit together. I thought I was becoming competent but it was just a part of my goddamn mental disorder.\n\nI've missed work everyday since those 3 weeks now. I haven't lifted or ran since then. I haven't left my room unless it's to eat or use the bathroom. And of course I have regained tons of weight from emotional eating. \n\nIn my darkest and saddest moments I can hear voices telling me to kill myself. Those same voices that plagued me at 20 years old. Voices I can't stop or silence.\n\nThey tell me I'm a freak, a burden. And they're right. Who could ever love me? I'm mentally ill. Nobody can ever understand. No one will really ever care. \n\nHow could they?\n\nI'm not only mentally ill, I'm a failure. Because so many others function better than I do. Better than I ever could. I read such inspiring stories about those who have overcame there mental illness, those who can persist even when things get dark and I cry. Because I know I never will.\n\nI can't live like this.\n\nI shouldn't be alive. I shouldn't have been born. My family shouldn't have to deal with a failure of a son like me. I can't be cured. I can't be changed.\n\nMy plan is to buy a gun. And shoot myself. I know it's not my fault but I can't take this sadness anymore and I cannot live the rest of my life with this sickness. I'm not strong enough.\n\nI don't know when I'll do it but I just don't see myself making it past 27 years old.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SuicideWatch","subreddit_id":"t5_2qpzs","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/SuicideWatch","subreddit_subscribers":360676,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I'm a burden to everyone around me.

Cars since 1980s have only shown km\/h instead of dual units, making miles an archaic unit.\n2. **Fuel economy**:- As common for developing nations, we use *km\/l*, not *l\/100 km*.\n3. **Units used to describe people:-** This one is mixed. We as Indians don't weigh ourselves in lbs., but in kg. I weigh 60 kg. :) But when finding how tall we are, we generally use ft. and in., although telling our height in cm is on the rise. I am 6 ft. 2 in., as well as 188 cm tall.\n4. **Cooking**:- Just like above, cooking is also a bit tricky. Although the mass of ingredients is primarily in kg, volume can be both l as well as tsp. and tbsp. Basically, if the volume is large like 1 L, then we are in metric, but if smaller than that, then we are in tablespoons and teaspoons. *Note:-* Many people have also started using ml for such smaller volume.\n5. **Science**:- No doubt it is completely metric! :)\n\n*There was a typo in my height in cm.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Metric","subreddit_id":"t5_2r25p","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Metric","subreddit_subscribers":6568,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Indian Metrication","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.97,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Metric\/comments\/qk44nr\/indian_metrication\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I was in my late 20s and worked with a bunch of guys who were much older than me. A bunch of macho bros who liked to try to turn every unload into a weird masculine pissing contest. \"Hey look at me I just stacked this pallet full of 100lb air conditioners by myself!\" They would try to tease me about not doing as much as them and for asking for help lifting heavy things. (Always team lift heavy things people!) \"I'm old enough to be your dad and I can work circles around you kid!\" A lot of the standard jokes about the younger generation being useless blah blah blah. I'm 6'4\", 210lbs and I keep myself in good shape. I could have easily out worked all of those guys but I'm not stupid and I'm not going to risk my health for any job. I got paid the same whether I did the bare minimum or gave 200%. All these guys had bad backs, bum knees, dodgy hips and the like. I ran into one of my former co-workers yesterday, he is in his early 60s now and not doing good. Multiple back surgeries and unable to work. Just walking looked painful for him and he is on some pretty strong pain meds, which can lead to a whole mess of other problems. I feel bad for the guy but maybe slinging 100lb air conditioners and lawn mowers around by yourself for all those years wasn't the best idea. Don't sacrifice your body for your work! You don't want to finally get to retirement and not be able to enjoy it because your body is too broken down.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_subscribers":2009232,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Ran into a former co-worker.
