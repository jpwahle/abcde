I joke a little, she laughs, and is incredibly cute and shy. Where she wanted to go was a good 30 mins away and there is no direct way of getting there, lots of turns, streets to go down that sort of thing. So I try to explain how to get there and I can tell she really isn't following. She is still laughing and this is where I fuck up. I know she looks interested, and I know all I have to do is just say \"I'll take you there\" and we can chat and flirt on the way. But I dont! and this is what I'm so fucked off about. I know I can flirt, she is flirting with me, everything in this interaction is saying YES YES YES! But I don't offer to walk her there. All I'm thinking about is getting to the pool to have a swim. I didn't really need to go, it's not like I was meeting people there. Worst of all at the time of talking to her I knew that's a shit excuse, and I know I should offer to walk her there. I have missed swim days in the past for less meaningful things. But I just dont offer, I sabotage myself...\n\nAnyhow after explaining the rout a couple more times, she starts to look a little distant/disappointed then says \"I will ask someone else, thanks\" and she starts to walk off.

A while ago, after building a career for myself, I came to the realisation that I just haven't had a girlfriend for quite a while. To start off with I was just career focused and enjoyed being single, as a matter of fact I loved being single. Then after a few years I met a woman I really liked, she had guys around her all the time so I knew this was going to take a little bit of work. I started reading pickup and self-help stuff and have completely turned my life around. I have pursued my hobbies and developed many interests (away from computers) and built a life I enjoy living. I work full time so I'm constantly busy and always have evenings/weekends booked out, where I'm doing something I enjoy.\nI exercise regularly and in very good shape. I don't have a problem approaching strangers and know a lot of different people. After all of this work I found out a lot about myself and also discovered that the girl that I initially started doing this all for I was no longer interested in, but fuck it I'm doing this for myself now and I'm going to keep doing it.\n\nThe girls in my social circle have either friend zoned me or I've fucked up with due to my past AFC ways.

I'm mostly working on day game, I don't like clubs and I'm also looking for more than just a one night shag.\n\nLearning this stuff has improved me drastically, before I could never look a girl in the eye, I didn't know what flirting was and there was just a whole bunch of stuff that I was clueless about.

I will try and keep this as short as possible, and just present the facts.\n\n        I'm 25, my boyfriend is 38. I've been out for about a year and a half and he's been out for 4 years. I met him 6months ago when I moved to London. He was the first guy I'd gotten with here, and we both fell instantly in love, we moved in together about a month or so ago. \n\n        Back home in Ireland I have gotten with exactly 4 guys, so my boyfriend is my 5th. My boyfriend has had 3 long term boyfriends (over a year) and loads of sexual encounters, even a period of 6months he calls his “slut phase”.\n\n        I love him to bits, I really do, and I know he loves me. My problem is that he talks about his exes (alot) and some of his sexual encounters (sometimes) around me, and it makes me acutely aware that I never really went through that “fun period” when I came out, he has so many stories of randomly hooking up, which frankly just make me jealous. Sometimes I think “I want that, I want to have that crazy single London experience before settling down”. I think he loves the fact that no one else in London got their paws on me before he did, and I hate the fact that a lot of people have had him under such casual circumstances. \n\n        The weird part is I never used to feel this way, whenever we first got together, from day one when he would talk about his exes etc I asked him not to talk about it around me, as it made me very uncomfortable. He just can’t seem to help himself though and says he’s being as honest as possible. Last night I really summed it up for him by saying “Every time you mention your past experiences around me, it is a constant reminder that I don’t really have many, it makes me jealous, and kind of wish I had have met you a few months down the line in London” I think he got the hint, but I’m worried the damage has been done.\n\n        As I say we now live together, I love him, but I’m questioning whether or not I moved way too fast on this one.

I will try and keep this as short as possible, and just present the facts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    I&amp;#39;m 25, my boyfriend is 38. I&amp;#39;ve been out for about a year and a half and he&amp;#39;s been out for 4 years. I met him 6months ago when I moved to London. He was the first guy I&amp;#39;d gotten with here, and we both fell instantly in love, we moved in together about a month or so ago. \n\n    Back home in Ireland I have gotten with exactly 4 guys, so my boyfriend is my 5th. My boyfriend has had 3 long term boyfriends (over a year) and loads of sexual encounters, even a period of 6months he calls his “slut phase”.\n\n    I love him to bits, I really do, and I know he loves me. My problem is that he talks about his exes (alot) and some of his sexual encounters (sometimes) around me, and it makes me acutely aware that I never really went through that “fun period” when I came out, he has so many stories of randomly hooking up, which frankly just make me jealous. Sometimes I think “I want that, I want to have that crazy single London experience before settling down”. I think he loves the fact that no one else in London got their paws on me before he did, and I hate the fact that a lot of people have had him under such casual circumstances. \n\n    The weird part is I never used to feel this way, whenever we first got together, from day one when he would talk about his exes etc I asked him not to talk about it around me, as it made me very uncomfortable. He just can’t seem to help himself though and says he’s being as honest as possible. Last night I really summed it up for him by saying “Every time you mention your past experiences around me, it is a constant reminder that I don’t really have many, it makes me jealous, and kind of wish I had have met you a few months down the line in London” I think he got the hint, but I’m worried the damage has been done.\n\n    As I say we now live together, I love him, but I’m questioning whether or not I moved way too fast on this one. Does anyone have any similar experiences? I’m worried that if I end things with him so I can experience the single life in London, I will never find love like it again. I’m also worried that if I stay with him I will constantly begrudge him for taking that experience away from me.\n\n    Stuck between a rock and hard place eh?\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I’m being a dick for thinking about throwing away love to have a “slut moment” please tell me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1312238150,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

First time post so I appreciate the advice. I've been with my wife about 7 years, married for 2. We've both always been pretty welcome to partying and drinking so this is really nothing new. The problem is my wife tends to be the girl that over drinks and blacks out and makes a fool of herself. Over the years I've kind of just been thinking she'd grow out of it. I've got nothing against drinking - I love it. But I'm starting to lose count of the number of times we're around friends and she's the drunkest person there. \n\nI just hit the breaking point on a boat trip we were on. She's not a great swimmer and just jumped out of the boat for no reason. I had to jump in and rescue her. The worst part is that she doesn't remember this happening at all. \n\nWhen we're sober together things are great! I love her, but I'm all of a sudden the guy married to the lush that's going to embarrass (or endanger) herself. I'm kind of wondering if I'm just growing out of that stage and she's still there. I've talked to her before about it and she got defensive about how I'm trying to change her and accused me of \"getting old\". I know I have to talk to her, but what's the best way to do this?? Anyone else run into this situation?? And what am I supposed to say if we go to a party or something? Its OK for everyone else to get drunk except you??\n\nIn case you're wondering, I'm 28 and she's 25. Thanks!\n\n**UPDATE**\nFirst, thank you everyone for the replies. If anything it helped me get my thoughts straight and help me believe that I'm not a crazy person here. \nSo, I laid it all out there for her tonight. Told her that I'm not happy with the amount she drinks sometimes, told her it embarrasses me, told her that I just flat out don't like being around her when she's like that. Most of which we had argued about before in the past.... but this time I said I just can't handle it anymore, the boat incident was pretty much the last straw. \nWell she went through her stages... got defensive; threw it back at me about how I get drunk sometimes (easy rebuttal since I rarely black out or get to her level); started crying; but finally agreed to cut it back. Meaning no shots or drinking excess amounts of wine. There was more to the argument, like discussing several specific examples (she asked....). So she didn't say she would stop drinking, but that's not really what I was going for. I'm just looking for moderation and to have a wife that I, and other people, can respect. The whole thing ended with her going to bed because she works early in the morning, so I wasn't completely satisfied how it ended. She seemed to just get upset and then just admit defeat to end the argument. So I guess I'll just wait and see if she was sincere or not. If not, I'll try the video camera idea. I'll let you know if it comes up tomorrow again. I kind of hope it does because after she went to bed I thought of a bunch of other things I wanted to say.

I don&amp;#39;t want to bring this up if its going to add to the drama that we don&amp;#39;t need; his friend is very friendly, I don&amp;#39;t get any attraction vibes from him, and I don&amp;#39;t want to seem like I&amp;#39;m bringing this up in retaliation simply because I&amp;#39;m still super pissed about Friday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what does it &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;? Should I be worried?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1312234757,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

Somewhat useless background that integrates itself into the story later: I have been in martial arts since I was 4 and have been fighting in various MMA competitions for 11 years, been all over the world competing in Muay Thai tournaments, etc. No internet badassery, just facts.\n\nAnyway, so I was with a girl (off and on) for about 10 years (7th grade - a couple years after college). I went to college in a different state and she stayed in our hometown to work (she’s too stupid for college anyway). We decided it would be best to have an open relationship while I was at college to give us a chance to date other people and make sure that we were the ones we really wanted to spend the rest of our lives with. Well...about 2 years into the \"open relationship\" thing, I went home on holiday and knocked her up (birth control failure). Not taking responsibility was out of the question, so I finished my last 2 years of college, left my girlfriend I had at the time, and went home to be a full-time Dad.\n\nI started working about a week after graduating, got a house, girlfriend and daughter moved in. At this time, I had NO feelings for my daughter’s mom whatsoever; I was mainly just doing it to keep the family together. I knew the whole time it was a terrible idea; I just wanted to keep things together as long as I could. Well that lasted about 4 years. My ex turned out to be an alcoholic and was spending more of my money, less and less time and home, quit her job, and expected me to support her worthlessness and our daughter (she stayed at home all day and yet I paid $900/month for unnecessary daycare).\nSo I kick her out, we go through the whole custody thing and we are awarded split custody. Court doesn't care about the alcoholism, the late pickups from daycare, bringing a different scumbag home every week; not a surprise. I have a good lawyer and he pretty much warned me about all this, esp. how the courts (especially in Texas) favor the mother despite most circumstances.\n\nSo we've been broken up for about a year, but were able to come to an agreement where we would not bring others (boyfriends/girlfriends) into our daughter’s life unless it was someone we were really serious about if not planning on marrying.\n\nThat agreement lasted about 3 months before she introduced our daughter to the first scumbag, we'll call him Steve. I let it slide and figured I would give him a chance, but let him know he was towing a very thing line and all it takes is one fuckup and he's gone.\nHe fucked up after about a month, tried to spank my 5 year old daughter, she tells me about it, I take my daughter to my cousins house, find Steve, and proceed to remove his teeth. He's out of the picture after that. Reported what happened to our case worker and the court; case worker is concerned, but the court doesn’t give a shit. Scumbag 2, we'll call Paul Blart is a rent-a-cop who was probably bullied quite a bit when he was younger cause he abuses the shit out of his authority. He's worked at 6 different security companies in 2 years. When I finally meet Mr. Blart, I politely, but firmly explain to him he does not need to put his hands on my daughter and needs to understand his role as a boyfriend to a girl who has a kid with an active Dad. Mr. Blart decides he wants to prove his badassery and tries to hit me over the head with a beer bottle, except it doesn’t break (pussy). Needless to say, we get into an altercation and I shatter his jaw in the process. Blart even had the audacity to file an assault charge. Investigating detective takes a look at the surveillance tapes where it is clear Blart is the aggressor. No charges filed. Now, my scumbag ex is moving to another scumbag and I'm tired of dodging assault charges, but I was abused as a child and I cannot have my daughter going through anywhere near what I did.\n\n\nSo what do I do? How do I get these scumbags to understand their role and not cross the line?? I've dated a few girls with kids (who were fucking emotion wrecks, btw) but I never tried to be the kids Dad, just simply provide a good example for them to look up to (especially if Dad had bailed), but it wouldn't even cross my mind to spank or lay my hands on someone else’s kid.\n\nSo...anyone who’s been in this situation have any advice on how to keep these scumbags out of my daughter’s life? I have a good lawyer (I think; I pay him loads), but he always says it's up to the judge. So if any lawyers want to chime in, feel free. All I'm asking for is that the guy my ex is dating is to know his role and to respect the fact that my daughter has a Dad who is very much involved in her life and no boyfriend my ex has will ever replace that. For what it's worth, I haven't introduced any girls I've dated to my daughter because I don't want to bring a lot of random girls in and out of my daughter’s life. Ex doesn’t seem to care though. She is her #1 priority and sadly, our daughter is 4 or 5 down the list. tl;dr - ex is introducing scumbags she barely knows to my daughter (which we agreed was a no-no) and the court doesn’t give a shit so I don't know what to do to keep the scumbags away or at least encourage her to find a guy that's respectful.\n\nThanks reddit!\n\n\nEDIT 1* Thanks for the advice everyone. It's obvious I need to stop the fighting, I just kind of lose my cool when I find out assholes are putting their hands on my daughter. It also has to due with my childhood, but I'm 26 now so it's about time I figure out how to get over these things without resorting to violence. Surprisingly, my record is clean and it has been brought up in the courts, but I have some pretty well-respected character witnesses.

I'm 20, in college, she's 17, going to be a senior in high school. We've known each other for a while, even played together in our church worship band on Sunday mornings. Up until this past week or so, we had never really hung out or talked much. We started texting a bit more than usual, and she even invited me over to hang out one night where we just sat and talked for a solid 3 hours, and it was really fun. Two nights after that, my family was going out for ice cream and her and one of her friends came along. So every one else leaves, the two of us sit talking for maybe an hour until the place closes. She tells me she needs to go to the local store so I follow along, and after she buys stuff she needs we sit on our cars in the parking lot and talk for a few *more* hours until a storm hits and we say a quick goodbye and jump in our cars and go our separate ways in the pouring rain.\n\nThis past weekend, I tell her that I like her. She finds it sweet, but tells me that her dad had told her earlier in the week, before we hung out, \"You know mb9023 is almost 21 (not until January, and she'll be 18 in March) and you aren't allowed to date him, right?\" At the time she didn't think anything of it because she wasn't interested, but now it's kind of a different story.

After starting to go to the gym I easily got up to 130 within a few months, and stayed that way for a long while.

If not, here's what I do:\n\nGym 3 or 4 times a week. Now that it's the summer I'm also trying to ride my bike into work (total distance of about 20 miles, though so far I've only been riding half the way, since my cardio endurance is AWFUL) a couple times a week too.\n\nAlternating between 3 workouts:\n\n...\n\nChest and Back:\n\n3 sets of 125x5 Barbell Benchpress\n\n3 sets of 50(each arm)x5 Dumbell Incline Benchpress\n\n3 sets of 35(each arm)x8 cable fly things\n\n3 sets of 135x8 Deadlifts\n\n3 set of 130x8 seated cable row\n\n3 sets of 120x8 lat pulldown\n\nSome situps and planking and various core stuff\n\n...\n\nArms and Shoulders:\n\n3 sets of 60x8 Barbell dumbell curl (on the seated thing where you rest your arms on it to isolate)\n\n3 sets of 35(per arm)x8 dumbell curl\n\n3 sets of 70x8 standing cable tricep extensions\n\n3 sets of 60x8 lying overhead tricep extension\n\n3 sets of 25(each arm)x10 lateral raises\n\n3 sets of 100x6 overhead press\n\n...\n\nLegs:\n\n3 sets of 135x10 squats\n\n3 sets of 110x8 leg extensions\n\n3 sets of 130x8 leg curl\n\n3 sets of 100x10 calf raise\n\n...\n\nAnd that's what I do. I eat quite well. I can't tell you an exact calorie count since I cook a lot of my own meals from scratch. Usually it's something along the lines of\n\nBreakfast: oats with apples and orange juice.\n\nLunch: Super varied. Whatever I feel like having downtown.\n\nDinner: Something big with a lot of meat and rice/potatoes.\n\nAnother dinner: Something fairly big right before I got to bed.\n\nIf anyone could give me some pointers on improving I'd love to hear it. I seem to have peaked out at 142. I'm not gaining any strength, I'm not gaining any definition, I'm just not going anywhere.

I didn't have to face any fundamentalists or endure church or battle against religious ignorance. On the contrary, I was raised with no concept of a god. I didn't get the concept of ultimate creator or that there were deities out there that watched our every move. \n\nMy parents are not atheists as much as apatheists. They just didn't care. My dad came from a Catholic background, but he stopped caring years ago. He never taught me about it. My mom is an apathetic about everything, not just religion. The TV shows I watched and the books I read never mentioned religion. Stuff like Spongebob, Winnie the Pooh, Looney Toons, Hey Arnold, and Superman didn't bring up religion, or it completely flew over my head. My friends never brought up going to church or that stuff. This is even odder because I had at least two friends who were the \"Christian in name only\" type that went to church and did nothing else remotely Christian. My teachers didn't bring up religion either.

You should not think that I could be Schizophrenic.\n\nI can exchange voice, video, smell,  people can move small move muscles on my body from distance and much more\nand all messages from me are transmitted to big number of people so I am a Mental Radio.\nOne of the most advanced things I can do is to talk brain to brain and it is very fascinating,\nworks  100% and it is really talk direct to brain.\n\nWhat I find most fascinating my telepathy is nearly identical what Schizophrenics experiences.\nThey can get voice, videos and smell, I can transmit voice , video and smell using telepathy.\nPeople can connect my brain in such a way that they are like running my thinking, it is like you connect\nsome ones head and when you think he fill it like he is thinking, difficult to explain.\nWhen someone connect me he can think own thoughts inside my brain and that is exact what Schizophrenics are\ntalking about \"delusional thinking\".\n\nMy telepathy manifest itself exact like  \"Schneider's first-rank symptoms\".\n\nWhat I want to tell is that I think that is very big mistake not to take me seriously and make research with me and stop using me\nfor creating some idiot show in which my life is just getting vested and some idiots find employment.\nI think that some of \"Schizophrenics\" are just receiving from some person from very long distance.\n \nThey are few important differences, moving small muscles on my body and sex.\nPeople can tell me that they are going to move some small muscle on my body and really move it.\nOne of most fascinating things is pen-is erection. It is possible to get my penis erected from distance any time ,\nit means I can have sex forever and very intensive , something like Tantra.\n\n\nI never found any document about any other existing person in human history like myself, but\n science never did serious research on me and I actually did not exist in world of science.\nI could easy give evidence for telepathy.Maybe some of Neurologist or scientist\ncould help me or is maybe interesting to make research on my phenomena.\n\nActually I should be celebrity but they(Croats, Swedish, Norwegians helped with some others and of some idiot church)\nturn it to be opposite. I am educated Software Developer and telepathic but I am going to finish on the street.\nI am very poor, have no job, no accommodation, no girlfriend for last 10 Years, I am 37 Years old.\nTerror for 10 Years, day after day, they call it show but it is cruel torture, but they accepted it to me and they\nfinance some idiots to psycho torture me day and night from distance. They must have spend 500 000 Euro for this.\nTheir show is to fight that I do not succeed in carrier and have no love life.\n\n\nProblem is that I think Swedish media(newspapers) was helping to collect money,\nI think they transfer money to those psychopaths and they are very strong in Sweden.\nI can not understand why they did such a terrible thing against me, probably they think I have no chance against them, they can do\nas they like. Is is just incredible what happened of my life because of Swedish/Norwegian media and police protection  to some mad\nYugoslavs. They turned my life to hell on the Earth.\n\nTorture show is protected in Sweden, I have no human rights there, people working on this can do any kind of  terror agains me\nand they enjoy protection of Swedish and Norwegian police. Norwegian police made actually intervention agains me, i have been badly\nterrorized by Norwegian police when I tried to protec me from those people.\nIt is very difficult to understand reason Swedish/Norwegian police protect this but after actually attack on me from Norwegian police\nI had to live Norway but they just send the same gang after me.\n\nThey found some expert in psycho torture, attacking my intimacy, waking me up, I do not know what is normal sleep for 10 Years.\nThey are psycho killing me, it is just incredible what some people are doing against me and they think this is show,\nI think there is no example in human history of psycho breaking like this.\nThey must have spend 50 000 - 70 000 hours on psycho terror, my life is nightmare , it is very difficult to understand motive for those idiots to\ncontinue day after day with this.\n\nAlso this is some stupid problem, some people think it is fun and show that I have to live for 10 Years single and alone\nin poverty but I find my live tragedy. I can not find a way to explain to some people in Norway and Sweden that this is not fun\nand that they do cruel terror on me.\n\nI have very difficult task to stop this terror. Telepathy do not exists in world of science and they think is Schizophrenia.\n\nTerror:\n1. I am Software developer and i have to focus on my work but he is spending all day long talking to me\n15-17 hours a day and he is using tactics of psycho terror, usually used on war prisoners in concentration  camps\nin Bosnia. He wake me up any time in the night just to psycho break me. Well for last few Years I live on nearly no income,\nsomethimes I find some farm work and I live in total poverty.\n\n2. Diarrhea problem. He can move muscles in my stomach and he do it all the time, he is in distance of few kilometer day and\nnight and terrorizing my stomach. He or group of dirty perve-rts is working\nday and night around me on it.\nAt the end my stomach is really not working and I have eating problems and\ncan get diarrhea.  I am getting to look similar to war prisoner.\n\n3. Stalking and no privacy. He is stalking on me day and night , in shower, toilet, when doing my\nintimacy things and more. He has no respect for privacy.\n\n4. He is trying to get me into fight with some people.\n Also to create conflict and if it no work then they can pay someone to go  more direct on me or to attack on me.\n Once they paid some mad alcoholic to attack me, on the next place they arrange people to provoke me and do\n some things against me .\n \n \n \n This is typical example of story I have to listen to day after night for last 9 Years:\nSTART ======================================================================================\n \n - \"you are old and you are never going to have young girlfriend\"\n - \"I have destroyed the most important part of your life 28 - 37\"\n - \"You have to marry someone that some gay was fu_ck_ing all the time before and you have no life\"\n - \"You want to fu_ck someone wife, what if you fu_ck some girl than you are fu_cking someone future wife,\n    better you not sex. You can fu_ck someone future wife if you fu_ck. You do not fu_ck I am stalking on you\n    you do not fu_ck and you do not fu_ck someone future wife\" .

You should not think that I could be Schizophrenic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can exchange voice, video, smell,  people can move small move muscles on my body from distance and much more\nand all messages from me are transmitted to big number of people so I am a Mental Radio.\nOne of the most advanced things I can do is to talk brain to brain and it is very fascinating,\nworks  100% and it is really talk direct to brain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I find most fascinating my telepathy is nearly identical what Schizophrenics experiences.\nThey can get voice, videos and smell, I can transmit voice , video and smell using telepathy.\nPeople can connect my brain in such a way that they are like running my thinking, it is like you connect\nsome ones head and when you think he fill it like he is thinking, difficult to explain.\nWhen someone connect me he can think own thoughts inside my brain and that is exact what Schizophrenics are\ntalking about &amp;quot;delusional thinking&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My telepathy manifest itself exact like  &amp;quot;Schneider&amp;#39;s first-rank symptoms&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I want to tell is that I think that is very big mistake not to take me seriously and make research with me and stop using me\nfor creating some idiot show in which my life is just getting vested and some idiots find employment.\nI think that some of &amp;quot;Schizophrenics&amp;quot; are just receiving from some person from very long distance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are few important differences, moving small muscles on my body and sex.\nPeople can tell me that they are going to move some small muscle on my body and really move it.\nOne of most fascinating things is pen-is erection. It is possible to get my penis erected from distance any time ,\nit means I can have sex forever and very intensive , something like Tantra.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never found any document about any other existing person in human history like myself, but\n science never did serious research on me and I actually did not exist in world of science.\nI could easy give evidence for telepathy.Maybe some of Neurologist or scientist\ncould help me or is maybe interesting to make research on my phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually I should be celebrity but they(Croats, Swedish, Norwegians helped with some others and of some idiot church)\nturn it to be opposite. I am educated Software Developer and telepathic but I am going to finish on the street.\nI am very poor, have no job, no accommodation, no girlfriend for last 10 Years, I am 37 Years old.\nTerror for 10 Years, day after day, they call it show but it is cruel torture, but they accepted it to me and they\nfinance some idiots to psycho torture me day and night from distance. They must have spend 500 000 Euro for this.\nTheir show is to fight that I do not succeed in carrier and have no love life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Problem is that I think Swedish media(newspapers) was helping to collect money,\nI think they transfer money to those psychopaths and they are very strong in Sweden.\nI can not understand why they did such a terrible thing against me, probably they think I have no chance against them, they can do\nas they like. Is is just incredible what happened of my life because of Swedish/Norwegian media and police protection  to some mad\nYugoslavs. They turned my life to hell on the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Torture show is protected in Sweden, I have no human rights there, people working on this can do any kind of  terror agains me\nand they enjoy protection of Swedish and Norwegian police. Norwegian police made actually intervention agains me, i have been badly\nterrorized by Norwegian police when I tried to protec me from those people.\nIt is very difficult to understand reason Swedish/Norwegian police protect this but after actually attack on me from Norwegian police\nI had to live Norway but they just send the same gang after me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They found some expert in psycho torture, attacking my intimacy, waking me up, I do not know what is normal sleep for 10 Years.\nThey are psycho killing me, it is just incredible what some people are doing against me and they think this is show,\nI think there is no example in human history of psycho breaking like this.\nThey must have spend 50 000 - 70 000 hours on psycho terror, my life is nightmare , it is very difficult to understand motive for those idiots to\ncontinue day after day with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also this is some stupid problem, some people think it is fun and show that I have to live for 10 Years single and alone\nin poverty but I find my live tragedy. I can not find a way to explain to some people in Norway and Sweden that this is not fun\nand that they do cruel terror on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have very difficult task to stop this terror. Telepathy do not exists in world of science and they think is Schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Terror:\n1. I am Software developer and i have to focus on my work but he is spending all day long talking to me\n15-17 hours a day and he is using tactics of psycho terror, usually used on war prisoners in concentration  camps\nin Bosnia. He wake me up any time in the night just to psycho break me. Well for last few Years I live on nearly no income,\nsomethimes I find some farm work and I live in total poverty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diarrhea problem. He can move muscles in my stomach and he do it all the time, he is in distance of few kilometer day and\nnight and terrorizing my stomach. He or group of dirty perve-rts is working\nday and night around me on it.\nAt the end my stomach is really not working and I have eating problems and\ncan get diarrhea.  I am getting to look similar to war prisoner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stalking and no privacy. He is stalking on me day and night , in shower, toilet, when doing my\nintimacy things and more. He has no respect for privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is trying to get me into fight with some people.\nAlso to create conflict and if it no work then they can pay someone to go  more direct on me or to attack on me.\nOnce they paid some mad alcoholic to attack me, on the next place they arrange people to provoke me and do\nsome things against me .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is typical example of story I have to listen to day after night for last 9 Years:\nSTART ======================================================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;you are old and you are never going to have young girlfriend&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;I have destroyed the most important part of your life 28 - 37&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;You have to marry someone that some gay was fu_ck_ing all the time before and you have no life&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You want to fu_ck someone wife, what if you fu_ck some girl than you are fu_cking someone future wife,\nbetter you not sex.
