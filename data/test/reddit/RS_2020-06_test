This only happens ~3 days before my period. I can still exercise during my period and the pain isn\u2019t as bad when it\u2019s before my period. I also get really bad premenstrual cramps (pain scale 8\/10), basically I take 800mg of ibuprofen every 4hours from 3days before my period to 3days into my period, that doesn\u2019t take the pain away completely but it does help. My periods have always been fairly regular expect a 4 month period when I was 18 when I didn\u2019t get my period because of too much exercise and dieting. Before and after then my periods have always been really regular. Other pertinent information: I have Celiac\u2019s Disease (autoimmune gastrointestinal disorder), my maternal grandmother has a retroverted uterus, my paternal grandmother had some type of cancer in her reproductive organs (not sure which) that required a hysterectomy when she was ~36, my mom never had any issues besides having a bartholin cyst removed, other than that she had 5 children with no complications and she never had issues getting pregnant. \n\nI haven\u2019t gone to my OBGYN since I am 19 due to poor scheduling but I don\u2019t know if I should bring this up.

Due to this, my dad has pushed me to pick a college major so I can schedule my classes accordingly. I had originally considered Bioengineering, but after taking a few classes here and there, I quickly realized I was more interested in the Biology part rather than the Engineering. This led me to change my idea of what major I wanted to pursue from Bioengineering to Biotechnology. Considering my dad is currently studying to be an Electrical Engineer, he was not happy to hear I decided to shift my focus away from the career he praised and loved a lot. Since I told him that, he's spent every waking moment telling me how I'm wasting my time, I'm just being a coward for picking an easier major, and that I will regret my choices in the future. Now he's even tried using the fact that, as the prophecies continue to be fulfilled, the knowledge I will gain from my major will be useless to me compared to that I would gain from studying as an engineer. \n\nI feel like his opinions are very biased and unfair but I can't tell him that because since he's the adult and he knows better than me so my opinion doesn't matter unless it aligns with his. As much as I try to ignore his words, though, him constantly bringing up the final days in order to incite fear in me is a very common and effective tactic he uses on me since it constantly causes me to question everything I'm doing and if I'm actually right in what I think despite me being a child.\n\nShould I listen to my dad and change my major since he would know better being the adult or should I stick to I want to do since I honestly think he's wrong in what he's saying?

In one such Japanese class, I was sitting with a friend and the teacher was about to start the class. She started writing on the board \"Prepositions\" then she paused for a second and wrote \"and\" in front of \"Prepositions\", turned around to look at us (the whole class) as if she was thinking something and then turned back towards the blackboard and erased \"and\". She paused again as if she was thinking something and after about 10-15 seconds wrote \"and\" in front of \"Prepositions\" again but this time she added \"the\" after \"and\". I remember looking carefully towards to board and trying to understand what was happening. Then the teacher erased everything and just simply wrote \"Prepositions\" on the top of the blackboard like a heading. Then I noticed something weird. I noticed that I was not in my body, in fact, I was watching all this unfold in front of me from someplace higher up. I could look down on my body sitting in the class and paying attention to the blackboard. It was as if I was almost a foot above my head. Then as soon as the teacher stopped writing on the board my perspective changed and it was suddenly a bird-eye view. I woke up the next morning not thinking much about the dream but remembering every detail very clearly. I continued with my life completely forgot about the dream in a few days.\n\nA few months go by and I am in school waiting for the Japanese class to start, sitting next to my friend. The teacher walked in, settled her things down and started writing on the blackboard. She wrote \"Prepositions\" then she stopped as if she was thinking something and then wrote \"and\" in front of it. She then turned around and looked as if she was deep in thought then faced the blackboard again and proceeded to erase the \"and\". It was as if that triggered something in me and I whispered under my breath to myself \"and\" and \"the\". My friend happened to hear it and said \"What?\", she then looked and the blackboard and pointed out that the teacher wrote exactly what I said. I looked at her a little shocked and told her that she will now erase it and simply write \"Prepositions\" on the top of the board like a heading then turn around and start the class. To my friend's horror that is exactly what happened. She was shocked and I was shocked because by this time I realised that I saw this happen exactly like it did in my dream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was not an isolated incident. Things like this have happened to me several times in my life. Some before this incident and some as recent as 3 weeks ago (I am 22 now). Is this premonition or lucid dreaming? What does this mean? As I have grown I realised that the dreams that do come true are now not as literal as they were when I was younger but a lot of elements and events from my dreams still happen exactly as they did in the dream.

I could barely breathe, I had no stamina -- I started from zero.  Gym class memories still make me cringe to this day, and the stigma and embarrassment of not being as fast or able as other people kept me from being motivated.\n\nI'm overweight\/obese and have been since puberty, clocking in at nearly 290 as a 23 year-old female (I'm 5'7\"), as of the beginning of this year (the last time I weighed myself).\n\nFast forward 30 days, and here I am at W5D1!! 5 minutes straight is a breeze. I feel stronger, faster, more motivated, and FAR more rewarded by a successful jog than my usual whole bag of comforting Cape Cod Kettle Chips (definitely still eating them, but I've started naturally craving moderation). My stamina has improved, I'm visibly slimming down (credit to IF too), and I am so much more in tune with my body. As the weeks go on, each new milestone seems less and less scary, and I'm astounded by the motivation I'm feeling to become better and better (#thanksendorphins). \n\nAll of this is to say that this IS possible! I know how it feels being the person at the beginning of this journey, saying \"well, it must be easier for them, but it can't for me, nothing sticks\/I've tried everything\/etc\". This experience has truly taught me that building a new strength over time is not only possible, but manageable, and increasingly easy.\n\nThis community is so supportive, diverse, and encouraging! Stay here and absorb that energy. Share every success! Even if it's just a walk for 15 minutes for a while until you're feeling able and confident enough to try it. You may or may not notice some fun thumbs up from neighbors or cars driving down the street, as well -- it feels awesome! \n\nSending love and encouragement your way!!!

I will not use any names but I would love to tell my story to all. I am 17 years old, I live in rural Pennsylvania and I converted to Judaism. It all started a couple years ago, when I came out as gay. I came out to my friends, but I hadn't come out to my family (more on that later). I had tried to be an Evangelical homosexual for some time, but I started to notice some things about Christianity that I didn't like.\n\nThe first thing that started to drive me away from Christianity is my Neo-Nazi family. My grandmother is so strictly Christian that it is annoying. Every day I have to listen to her racist, homophobic Christian banter and it drives me insane. My aunt is even worse. She and my cousins are dangerously Neo-Nazi. My cousin has gone so far as to threaten kids in school (and my aunt paints him as the victim). It's their skin-head, Neo-Nazi rhetoric that first drove me away from Christianity.\n\nThe second thing comes from the other side of my family. My great grandmother gave me multiple booklets, novels and pamphlets to help keep me Christian in High School (Look how well that worked \ud83d\ude02). One of the pamphlets laid out the beliefs of the Brethren Church, including topics like Homosexuality and Abortion. The booklet said horrible things and referenced horrific verses from their Bible to justify why homosexuality is a sin. Let's just say that that booklet is no longer in existence. But it's memory serves as the tipping point for when I left the Christian Church.\n\nI then tried many religions to find out who I was. One week, I was meditating and listening to the Sutras; The next week I was facing the Kaaba and prostrating myself to Allah, but not truly fit. What lead me to Reform Judaism, you may ask. It was an article that said how well religions tolerate homosexuals. On top was Unitarianism, but I didn't really understand that religion. Number two was Buddhism, but I don't really believe in reincarnation after I stopping trying Hinduism. Third on the list was Reform Judaism.\n\nThat was two years ago. Although I still am a closeted gay, I wear Tzitzit on my shirts and I wear my Kippah around the house. I have a mezuzah on my bedroom door post and a menorah on my windowsill. That seems like the perfect ending to the story, but my story doesn't end there...\n\nWhen I am not in my house, I always wear an old Stetson hat that belonged to my great grandfather to hide my Kippah. I NEVER wear my Tzitzit outside of the house. This is to hide my religion from my dangerous family members. I now know part of the reason why I have to do this. My great grandmother (the same one as aforementioned) has a picture hanging in her house of one of my ancestors. She is a stark looking woman with an expressionless face. She is wearing a high-collared white shirt and a collar tie (basically a string that has the same purpose as a neck tie for those who don't know what I am describing.). The pin that holds the two ends of the tie together was a Swastika. I was shocked to think that I was related to her! A Nazi! But now that I look at the mannerisms of my grandparents on both sides of my family, I understand perfectly well.\n\nWhat is the moral of this story? My moral is that there is always someone in your family who will help you, who will support you. For me, that is my mother. She has said that she will support me no matter what religion I practice. So if there is anyone who has a similar story to me, I say find that person who will do that for you and hold close to them. That person is the one who will truly love you for who you are. If not, you could always DM me. I haven't been on Reddit very long and I don't know how DMs work on this but I'm also on Instagram under the same username (@isrealfx17). You could always message me there. I really hope my story inspires you to recognize who will truly support you and to hold them close to you.\n\nThank you","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ReformJews","subreddit_id":"t5_3cneh","subreddit_subscribers":4141,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My ancestors were actual Nazis, I converted to Judaism...","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.94,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ReformJews\/comments\/gualxl\/my_ancestors_were_actual_nazis_i_converted_to\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

As someone who struggled with acne I would sacrifice my first born for skin like [hers.](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B55e-cwpX-C\/) She actually has a skin care company where she sells masks, soaps and creams.

My insomnia and anxiety, which I've had since I was 7 (I'm 22 now) now got a new friend which is .. well, hot feet.\n\nSo this got me wondering- on a deeper level, how does this relate to art? Should you be able to make art while tired? Would it be any good? I'm scared to read my clients' emails (I do commission work) because I know my mind is foggy from lack of good sleep and reading is especially hard... but not drawing. I can draw on auto-pilot, I often would have my most productive hours right before bed, it's just more easy to get lost in it when I'm just the right kind of tired. Now I'm extremely tired and still need to draw.. no, rather, I want to draw, because I'll be tired whatever I do, I might as well do the right thing.\n\nI'll be trying to get in... not Flow state but Half-Asleep state as much as I can to get work done. It's easy when there's only one string of thought to follow.\n\nWould like to hear your thoughts if you've got some experience working when tired, negative or positive. How do you\/ would you deal with the situation?\n\nSome 6 weeks ago I started making videos on YT where I document my week-to-week life as an artist and this week I was so tired all the time there wasn't much to say. The way I see it, next week should be the hardest one yet and I'm hoping at least to get something out of it, something smart, something of a life lesson? Haha, I want to make stuff even though I'm tired.

There are, however, some dreams that I can never forget and I would like to know whether this has happened to someone else and what does this mean? \\[Long\\]\n\nI was about 14 years old and my school had a cultural exchange programme with Japan under which we were taught Japanese for 3 years. In one such Japanese class, I was sitting with a friend and the teacher was about to start the class. She started writing on the board \"Prepositions\" then she paused for a second and wrote \"and\" in front of \"Prepositions\", turned around to look at us (the whole class) as if she was thinking something and then turned back towards the blackboard and erased \"and\". She paused again as if she was thinking something and after about 10-15 seconds wrote \"and\" in front of \"Prepositions\" again but this time she added \"the\" after \"and\". I remember looking carefully towards to board and trying to understand what was happening. Then the teacher erased everything and just simply wrote \"Prepositions\" on the top of the blackboard like a heading. Then I noticed something weird. I noticed that I was not in my body, in fact, I was watching all this unfold in front of me from someplace higher up. I could look down on my body sitting in the class and paying attention to the blackboard. It was as if I was almost a foot above my head. Then as soon as the teacher stopped writing on the board my perspective changed and it was suddenly a bird-eye view. I woke up the next morning not thinking much about the dream but remembering every detail very clearly. I continued with my life completely forgot about the dream in a few days.\n\nA few months go by and I am in school waiting for the Japanese class to start, sitting next to my friend. The teacher walked in, settled her things down and started writing on the blackboard. She wrote \"Prepositions\" then she stopped as if she was thinking something and then wrote \"and\" in front of it. She then turned around and looked as if she was deep in thought then faced the blackboard again and proceeded to erase the \"and\". It was as if that triggered something in me and I whispered under my breath to myself \"and\" and \"the\". My friend happened to hear it and said \"What?\", she then looked and the blackboard and pointed out that the teacher wrote exactly what I said. I looked at her a little shocked and told her that she will now erase it and simply write \"Prepositions\" on the top of the board like a heading then turn around and start the class. To my friend's horror that is exactly what happened. She was shocked and I was shocked because by this time I realised that I saw this happen exactly like it did in my dream.\n\nThis was not an isolated incident. Things like this have happened to me several times in my life. Some before this incident and some as recent as 3 weeks ago (I am 22 now). Is this premonition or lucid dreaming? What does this mean? As I have grown I realised that the dreams that do come true are now not as literal as they were when I was younger but a lot of elements and events from my dreams still happen exactly as they did in the dream. Can someone please help me understand this?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Dreams","subreddit_id":"t5_2qmbx","subreddit_subscribers":221469,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Has this happened to anyone else?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Dreams\/comments\/guatba\/has_this_happened_to_anyone_else\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

This is then followed up with (or topped with) a protein of some kind, usually a salmon\/other fish or piece of lamb.\n\nI just eat what I am given and the rest of the day I drink water, and one bottle of gatoraid or cup of coconut water.\n\nSince starting this diet I have gotten into watching food shows on youtube. Basic to Bougie has been my go to but I do also watch some Gordon Ramsay videos. I never watched these shows before but I now watch these shows and drool as other people eat carbs.\n\nOh yeah... I drool now. I don't remember ever drooling in my life before but now I drool pretty frequently. That is weird.\n\nI was very hungry in the first week but even when I'm drooling I don't feel hungry anymore. There is not the intense need to snack as I had starting this out (I did break the OMAD on the 2nd day with a slice of cheese and some salsa in the dead of night).\n\nThe 2nd week I was very moody. I had to avoid my girlfriend one day because I was just in an intense and randomly angry mood all day. There was nothing to be angry about but I was just angry... and I am not an angry person. These first 2 weeks I didn't drink any gatorade (how many different ways will I spell this drink) or coconut water so I think this was just me feeling the carb deprivation.\n\n3 weeks in and I am feeling pretty good. It feels like this is something I can do for the rest of my life and I am told that I look like I am losing weight (I haven't been weighing myself so I couldn't really say whether I am or am not). I feel good and that is all that matters to me.\n\nI did break the Keto portion of my diet 3 days ago when I ordered a shrimp and pepper steak that were both breaded (I specifically asked if they were breaded and the lady on the phone said no... after picking it up and bringing it home turns out it was breaded. I was pretty upset but already ate my salad so I took breaking the Keto rather than breaking the OMAD).\n\nI can say that I don't think I have the will to do Keto without it being OMAD. I feel full in a way that I never really felt full in my entire life. I am someone who would eat at an All You Can Eat Buffet, feel completely full to the point where I would barf, sleep, then eat something that night. This diet fills me in a way where since I eat at the same time I don't get those urges to eat at night.\n\nI am just rambling, but I would be happy to hear thoughts and opinions on my new lifestyle. I am doing this completely on the urging of someone else but it feels so nice that I think its something I would continue.

I haven't seen any of my friends for nearly 3. Just me and my girlfriend in a 700 sq ft flat. She hasn't been working, I have. Yesterday we had an argument. See, it was my birthday on the 21st and we got an air conditioner from my family. It's great, it gets really hot in here sometimes. But between working, exercising (it helps my mood), and everything I can't do I was so exhausted. Emotionally, physically, mentally. I still am. She wanted to do all these things cleaning up the house, all I could do was put together this bloody AC (I'm not exactly a handyman). \n\nFor context, I am 27. I have had a bad drinking problem since I was 18. It got in the way of my life. Thus, I was with my parents until last year, and completely and utterly a virgin until I met my girlfriend. I hate not being able to do something. I hate not being perfect, even though I know I can't be. I put the thing together. I had all the excess packaging strewn out on the floor. I just hit this limit like \"I can't do this anymore\" so I lay down on our bed. I get these anxiety attacks. Like really bad ones where I start to question my own reality. Is earth real? Is the universe? Am I? I feel like I'm really an entity trapped in a room who has imagined this whole life. \n\nThey were never that bad before, but I used to get small ones. What? I don't know. They were really bad after using mushrooms and MDMA. Like what is time? Are we all doomed to repeat this over and over again? I digress. Thinking like that takes me to a really dark place. Suicide seems reasonable. That's how I got yesterday. I lay on the bed and stared into space. My girlfriend came in and I was unresponsive. I could feel my heart beating so fast, like a frenzy. And I snapped out of it. I guess it really scared her and she said all these things and was tearing into me it felt. I had told her I was having an anxiety attack, and she continued like this. I just told her \"you don't care about me.\" or something like that, something about shits being given. She got really offended and I just lost it. I yelled at her, about how I just had a bad attack, was feeling suicidal and she was still giving me the gears (she has IBS or something we don't know but it was bad yesterday). About how I wasn't doing my share around the home. I told her, well I bellowed really, that I have to go out in the world for 8 hours a day! I have hardly any energy after that, when I have to come home and be her entertainment, conversation. She has 8 hours a day and she just complains about how bored she is and she doesn't want to be in lockdown anymore. She does do lots around the house before all this, and during as well. I'm not so great at that, I don't mind living in relative filth for a bit but if I'm motivated I try. But some things I just don't know about. She does my laundry, but I'm happy to do it myself when I feel like it should be done for example. \n\nI've tried taking the garbage out, little things that I can do to lighten the load here or there but I feel like she should be doing the bulk of the load considering she is at home all day while I'm out working. And I have told her I don't feel great about going to work, but she told me she just couldn't handle us both having no jobs (though the government of Canada gives us income). \n\nIt's just a lot of micro things, all this tension and zero pay-off. I haven't had sex in 10 days. I need a distraction, I need the fucking serotonin. I rely heavily on getting some relief from stress. I don't cope very well. She just left for work 2 hours ago and my god I need a fucking drink so bad I feel like it's going to kill me. I just need a vacation from all this. So I'm going to fucking pull-through this without drinking. I'm 8 months sober.

I mean, look at the world. It's fucking trash. Every single part of it sucks. I know that this probably sounds super cliche but like, what is good right now? \n\nWe have racist murderers becoming cops and killing  people, riots in the streets almost everywhere, a motherfucking global pandemic, people being bulled to suicide on social media because of stupid shit on a reality TV show, an entire continent was on fire forever earlier this year, and I'm sure there's a ton of shit I didn't even remember because 1 week of this year feels like about 15 years. And even before all this we had more protesters being murderer in the streets in China. It's just complete horseshit and I'm tired of being a part of all this. \n\nI know the answer is to pull back from the news and online, but IDK if that's even possible anymore. I dropped Facebook and Twitter and it's still finding its way in. Life has evolved to the stupidest point possible now. Everything is a part of a never ending culture war between groups now. People were getting shot in the streets every day and nothing gets done about it because both political parties adopt the most extreme view in one way or the other and neither has any give so people just keep dying while they sit in their fucking offices either screaming into the void or offering hollow thoughts and prayers. Global warming is either wiping everyone out next year or is a myth created to scare people into doing..... something. Abortion talks are just people screaming \"BABY KILLER\" or \"SEXIST PIGS\" at each other. We're in the middle of a motherfucking pandemic and somehow that's in the culture war now too where you're either a stupid pussy for taking even the smallest precautions or you're called a complete POS for going to the grocery store. Now we have one group who wants everything shut down for years on year(can't do that) while the other is legit putting people on TV who are suggesting we sacrifice the elderly to save the economy(WTF). \n\nAnd no matter where you fall on anything, everyone wants you to have an opinion. I don't know isn't an option. I don't care certainly isn't. Saying I just want to live my life because I have enough personal demons to deal with gets people mad because you don't care enough about the \"real issues\" and then when you offer an opinion you're met with the fury of 4 billion suns because you don't have the same feelings as someone else, and now every single opinion someone has is life or death. \n\nLike shit. I'm 23 and I just want to enjoy my youth while I have it. My top worries are finding ways to work right now so that way I don't go homeless next month, not getting a virus to pass on my loved ones, and being sad that I can't watch my younger cousins grow up because of quarantining. That shits taking a toll on me the way it is, especially since my mental health isn't good even in normal situations. On top of that it's a never ending shit storm of politics which are even more unescapable where people don't just expect, but demand that you pick a side and fight for it. \n\nI don't want to deal with this anymore. I'm not suicidal, but it's hard to blame anyone for getting to that point. I'm struggling to find a single redeeming quality about my life or basically anyone elses right now and I'm afraid that we're too far gone to ever have things calm down.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"confessions","subreddit_id":"t5_2qq6g","subreddit_subscribers":808548,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"God damn do I hate being alive right now.

I don't normally visit this sub but I've just woken up from one of the creepiest dreams I've ever had and I need to get it out of my head, so apologies if this post is a bit off. I don't know what else to do because everyone I know is obviously asleep and I would also appreciate another person's input.\n\nReal life backstory before the dream itself:\nI currently live with my grandad and have done for the past year. In September my nan fell very ill and sadly passed away at the beginning of April. She's the closest person to me that has ever passed away and I'm 32 years old.\n\nDream itself:\nI was sat in my kitchen talking to my grandad. Nothing weird about that. Then my nan walked in and started talking to me but not to him. I can't remember what she was saying but she was washing dishes and pottering round the same as she did before she was ill. I was responding to her, and my grandad thought I was being a bit weird and I sort of realised within the dream that seeing and talking to my man wasn't right and she disappeared. \nNext thing I know, I was lying in bed at night and I could hear something in the kitchen. We live in a bungalow and my bedroom is opposite the kitchen so I opened the bedroom door and could just see someone's legs sat at the kitchen table. Not dismembered or anything, just the angle. My nan earlier in the dream had been wearing a white tshirt, beige cardigan and brown skirt, and these legs were covered by a brown skirt. I tried to scream but no noise came out so I ran down the hall into my grandads bedroom. I tried saying to him \"Nanny is in the kitchen\" a few times but again no sound came out. He eventually understood \"kitchen\" and started walking towards it, holding his hand out for me to hold. Just before getting to the kitchen door, we heard the rustle of paper and he looked at me, confused.\nHe opened the door properly and there was some random woman sat at the table, opening post. He shouted at her \"who the f*** are you an what are you doing in my house?\" She seemed shocked to see us.\nThen I think my brain was far too creeped out and I woke up.\n\nWriting that down has helped calm me down actually because I was really on edge after that dream. I don't often have dreams, and when I do they're not that vivid so this one really creeped me out.\n\nThankyou for giving me somewhere to vent, even if this never gets read. However, if anyone who knows anything about dreams could shed some light on my subconcious I would really appreciate it.

I should have listened to my gut when we first met and quit while we were ahead. You made comments about my body that made me uncomfortable. You said it would never happen again. You had tried to give me reassurance that you did find me attractive and that you didn't know why you said things that made me feel inferior. I should have walked away when you criticized me again on my birthday and left me crying and panicking alone in my car, while you slept peacefully in my bed, unaware that I had even left. I should have walked away when I realized that I craved attention and emotional connection from other men, because you couldn't give it to me. I tried to be compassionate. I tried to be understanding. You were depressed, and you never had a father figure in your life to teach you how to properly treat a woman. I communicated with you very clearly, but it was like you never truly heard me. You didn't take me on dates. After almost a year of being together, we have absolutely no pictures together. I have no memories to erase from my phone, but I still can't erase you from my head. I am ashamed that I let you hurt me so deeply, over and over again. You fell through once again on Valentine's day after I had emphasized how important it was for me. I stayed up late the night prior to make chocolate covered strawberries to surprise you with. You were not impressed. You told me you didn't have a sweet tooth and they ended up going to waste. We almost broke up that night. But, again, I was too compassionate. I decided to give you another chance when you begged me not to leave. I shouldn't have listened. The following week, you made another comment about my body, that ultimately, two months later, led to our breakup. I couldn't recover from feeling like I would never really be good enough for you. No amount of reassurance or \"take-backs\" could make me forget about how you compared me to an impossible standard for women. My self esteem grew worse and worse. I couldn't feel comfortable changing in front of you. I sucked in my belly whenever I couldn't avoid it. To this day, I still obsessively work out so that I can get the body you wanted me to have, though spite is my biggest motivator. I am 5'5\" and 120 pounds. I have always been happy with my body type. But now, I aim to get more muscular, like you wanted me to, so that I can find someone else who will appreciate my body regardless. I feel ashamed because, even after I found the courage to walk away and finally break up with you for good, I still came back a week later apologizing for my part in the breakup and wanting to work on things. Of course, you didn't want to. You told me you weren't sure if you were \"romantically interested in me,\" though you consistently assured me during our relationship that I was \"the one.\" I am left feeling absolutely heartbroken and confused, and I am sure you don't give a fuck. I regret ever meeting you. You added very little value to my life. You simply broke me down and to this day have not apologized. I wish I hadn't been so compassionate. If you were to apologize to me today and agree to give things another shot, I'd probably be naive enough to say yes. That's just the human in me, but you did not appreciate me enough.

When I was a teenager I got my one phone and phone plan and paid for it full price by myself. Time goes on, now I'm 22. They kicked me off their health insurance, so I pay for my own health, dental and vision. I also pay for my own car insurance, and pay them rent. Plus, I help out with groceries, and bring home free food from work all the time (starbucks).\n\nI'm still living with them because I'm working part time and in my last semester of college. \n\nShit hit the fan a bit ago and they're kicking me out. I'm on the waiting list for an apartment and everything. Awhile ago, it was agreed between my mom and I that she would sign my phone account over to my name. It had to be opened in her name because I was not an adult when I got my phone, even though I always paid for it myself. \n\nSo today, I get home from work and suddenly, my mom wants to join my phone plan. She wants an iPhone and wants to get on my plan to save money. \n\nI was genuinely baffled because of the previous agreement, and the fact that, THEY'RE KICKING ME OUT!?!?!!??!?!?! \n\nSo I said to her that I was going to actually ask her to sign the account over to me because I'm leaving eventually. And that was a big ol' fucking mistake. \n\nBoth parents are SCREAMING at me now. Saying I'm horrible and selfish. A horrible person. How could I do that to my own mother? They would never do that to their mother. They always treated me well (they have not, I have childhood ptsd). I told them I was genuinely confused and they said that I am lying and to come back when I am ready to tell the truth. \n\nSo can one of you kind souls tell me what the fucking is happening here because I'm still in shock. Am I selfish???? Was that wrong of me???? \n\nThey're also going to kick me off the car insurance plan that I'm on with them, even though I pay for it myself.

Especially since 2017, she got violent with my dad and has gotten worse since. \nI have two brothers with disabilities, one nonverbal with autism, and one with speech issues and Downs Syndrome. I've helped take care of them all my life. \n\nIn 2019, she faked a suicide while I was out of town for a friends graduation (the night I left) and used the cops against my dad. She was hardcore on meth, and got to the point where I couldn't recognize her. Continued using cops against my dad in several states and has played intense mind games with me and my dad. Eventually we found out she had been cheating on my dad with one of his closest friends, and let's say that is it's own issue. She denies every thing and never listens to anything. We moved from Kansas to Georgia in October. She refused to get my younger brother in school or do anything to help us get on our feet while we were living in an RV on my uncle's property. In December, I was finishing the online school I had begun, stressing wildly over finals, when one morning my mom starts a huge fight. She starts before anyone was awake, and then after the fight is over and I am working on school work (inside my uncle's house with wifi) she stole my dad's truck and took my brothers, and all their stuff while he was sleeping. She took them back to Kansas.\n\nMy dad went in February to try to get his truck back and she got him arrested the night he got there, leaving me stranded in Georgia. I had started my new school here and had a roof over my head so I wasn't in danger, but after so many traumas, this affected me. Because of COVID 19 my dad has still been stuck there and dealing with my nmom directly, and is once again in jail due to town drama. \n\nI can't go NC with my mom because of this and for fear of being cut off from my brothers. I love them with every thing I have and I couldn't live with myself if they got hurt because she was neglecting them or my blocking her makes her mad.\n\nHer texts give me instant panic attacks and the sound of her voice let alone the sight of her trigger what I assume to be PTSD (I'm not diagnosed). I mostly let things alone unless I'm really missing my brothers but I know it can't go on this way. My dad hasn't been able to contact me yet and I'm 17. I'm living half time at my uncle's and half time with my boyfriend (with parental permission). I can get a job and finish high school, and go to college, but I have no idea what will happen to my dad and brothers, or what chaos my mom will cause next. \n\nSorry for the long post, it's been bottled up for a while now and I will appreciate all comments that give advice\/support.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_subscribers":696016,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"How do other people deal with their nparents when they can't go NC?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.99,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/gubgmd\/how_do_other_people_deal_with_their_nparents_when\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I remember that I was watching like episode 100 and the other day ep 105. So I was skipping episodes. \nWhen Shippuden came out I stopped watching at the exact ep asuma died.

I started in February and I was so addicted that I was watching 20 eps a day, no joke. I even watch all the fillers. So my routine was, uni in the morning, lunch, watch naruto, go to work, dinner and naruto again. \nI always loved naruto and how well the story is written, the chakra concept and how they have hokages and villages. \nSo now that naruto is done I watched the movies and I start watching boruto.

This is my very first post on Reddit, as in my country it is very unpopular. I would like to share my story with you in the hope that one of you is experiencing something similar. I\u2019ll start from the beginning: from childhood, I felt that I was different from others, the elders told me to think before I did anything and I always had difficulty in being in a team, since my views were always different from the rest. But I did not notice this and my life was full of colors, as I kept learning something new and studying at school was easier for me than for the rest. But at 15, there was a turning point when I tried the weed - I had an experience that was more like an acid trip and my friends never experienced anything like it. After that, my life has completely changed. weed made me look at things differently and think about how I lived before. Then I was closer than ever to suicide, as overnight a huge number of questions fell upon me, to which I could not answer. The next 2 years were a period of rethinking. I began to analyze the events that happened before and came to the conclusion that something was wrong with me. I want to note that until the age of 15 I was quite sociable and had many friends, but after that I began to go into myself and lock myself up. Now I am 18 years old and I spent the last year mainly at home, I have several friends, but my life has turned into an existence. I graduated from high school and entered the best university in my country, but having gone to a lecture several times, I realized that I could not stand it and I had to drop out. Now I am confused because I do not know what to do next. I feel a huge wall between myself and others, I have absolutely no energy and I feel tired 10 minutes after I woke up, sometimes it seems to me that I live on another planet and look for people through a telescope. My relatives say that I have to grow up. But I feel that I have reached the peak of my development as a child. It\u2019s like I\u2019m being reborn every day, all my knowledge of the world is based on logical reasoning, which can change every day depending on the situation. I also found a lot of interesting things in myself, but I already wrote a lot of text here. I will be glad to hear any advice and am ready to answer any questions, I really want to understand what is really happening to me. I'm lost...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. I translated all this into Google translator. I know English, but it\u2019s easier for me to express my thoughts in my native language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n:)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"aspergers","subreddit_id":"t5_2rm6u","subreddit_subscribers":98725,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I need your help","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/aspergers\/comments\/gubks9\/i_need_your_help\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I've always had a weird relationship with suicidal thoughts. I'm 19 now and logically I know I am extremely privileged yet nothing really matters to me. Ever since I was a little dude everything irritated me and angered me. Everything would be so shitty but right before I would break something good would happen. I'd make a friend that said they cared until they left or id get addicted and enveloped in a hobby. Eventually the friends leave and eventually the hobby become a chore. My two most recent mountains were going to university and becoming a christian, not that I want to convert you or anything. I was messed up but my religion was able to pull me out of it but that was 2 years ago and now I lack the people that made me leave. They all just forgot about me. Going to university was a mountain because I could pretend like everything was alright. Everyone was so welcoming but as the months went on and people got to know each other better I've felt lost. And it's really weird for me because I have a lot of friends, I'm popular, people think I'm cool but no one knows me. No one actually cares about who I am on the inside. So many people say that we're friends yet if I don't message them first they wont reach out. I can't count how many times in the last two months that i've asked people if they were okay and doing well yet I can count the amount of times anyone has ever asked me the same question which is 0. Everything is pointless. I find something interesting but when I share it with people they barely register it. I keep reaching out but people have their own worlds and I'm just not a part of it. And this nothingness is giving me too much time to think. I try to distract myself as much as possible but even the distractions have become boring. I don't want to die but I have too much time to think about it. It's hard to explain, I've felt this way ever since I can remember and soon something is supposed to lift me up but this time is just different. Theres no one to reach out too. There is no opportunity to meet someone that I can lean on. Everything is so far away. I've made plans to be better when the school year comes around but thats in 2 months. I've never felt so alone. How can people listen to you express your passions but then just not actually want to connect? \n\nEven writing this feels pointless, because the encouragement is shallow, its surface level. I could say this entire thing to a person I've been friends with for 8 years and I'd get the same support but the support would be shallow either way. No one has passion anymore. Things are forgotten after 2 weeks. Everyone is on to the next best thing. Its been like this since I was a kid. What bigger thing can push me up when I've already found God and i've already completely changed cities and grown up and gone to university. A friend that actually cares this time? but it will happen all over again. They say that I matter so much to them, we'll talk for hours everyday for months than one day its over. They either ghost me, or they slowly fade. I watch them flourish make their own friends, start their own businesses, and I watch and say good for you I'm glad you're making it in life. \n\nDo I think I'll kill myself? Probably not and if I do it definitely wouldn't be planned. I'm glad I don't live in the US. Having a gun would be so easy so quick. but I know its a mistake, I know its selfish, I know I got a lot to live for! I have nice phones and nice shoes and nice guitars and nice skateboards and a nice computer and I go to a top university and no matter what I think that proves that i'm smart in some capacity and I have so many people that I talk to and they all call me friend.

I work from home so I'm not tied down to location, and am open to moving for the right reasons.\n\nA little more about me:\n\n* **Feminine** \\- I range from high femme to chapstick. I'm a designer so I'm obsessed with aesthetic and I love makeup &amp; fashion.\n* **On that self-improvement grind** \\- Super important to me, I'm always working on upgrading some aspect of myself or my life at any given time.

I have no problem opening up and letting people close to me, and I have no problem telling people I love them. It's easier to get hurt, but I've found that the genuine &amp; loving friendships and relationships that come from putting yourself out there are well worth the risk. I'm also romantic &amp; physically affectionate af btw. I'll put everything I have into loving you and making sure you never doubt that I do. \u2764\ufe0f\n* **Love culture** \\- Obviously I love to travel. I love trying new things, and experiencing cultures through mediums of all kinds - art, food, music, etc. Nothing scratches this itch more for me than seeing different cultures come together in harmonious ways. \ud83e\udd70\n* **Kinda nerdy** \\- But who isn't right? \ud83d\ude44My definition of that means: I'm a shameless weeb (and you should probably be at least weeb-tolerant if this is gonna go anywhere lol), I've spent my adult life working in tech, I'm a digital designer &amp; entrepreneur by trade, I love learning how things work, obsessed with space\/futurism\/cyberpunk\/etc.\n* **Ethnically ambiguous** \\- race doesn't matter to me, but most people seem to want to know up front.

I will hopefully be taking college classes next school year. I've been taking part-time classes in public school since 9th grade, but I'm mostly homeschooled. I have received college recommendation letters from public school teachers, but I also received my transcript and a college recommendation from my Nmom. Because I am homeschooled, she's technically my \"school counselor\". I couldn't apply to college without input from a school counselor, so I had to get my Nmom involved. \n\nI sent an invite to my Nmom via the Common App way back in September. Since December, I've been reminding her of upcoming application deadlines at least twice a month. The application deadline for my top choice college is June 1st. My Nmom didn't even look at Common App until last night (May 30th) when I apparently \"dumped it on her at the last minute\". \n\nNot only did my Nmom yell and scream, but she also forced me to help her through her part of the Common App. I understand that she had never done this before and was stressed. However, I am a student who waived my FERPA rights. I should not have heard (let alone helped) her do these things. My transcript and counselor's recommendation were HER job. I told her this, but she didn't care. She was offended by the idea that I would leave any work solely for her.\n\nMy Nmom also has it in her head that my top choice college is the only college she will allow me to attend. She didn't decide this until December, months after I had already asked my teachers for recommendation letters. However, she did say she would allow me to apply to other colleges. Otherwise, two of my teachers would've wasted their time writing recommendation letters for me. \n\nIn my Nmom's college recommendation letter, she decided to specifically address my top choice college. She read the letter to me, and I was appalled. As a school counselor, you can only write one recommendation letter for each student, which will be used on all their college applications. I asked her to change the letter, but she screamed at me, complaining about how much work she's put towards MY application. I told her that if I can't apply to other colleges, then I am wasting my teachers' time by having them write recommendation letters. Her response was \"Too bad. You've wasted two teachers' time\". It wasn't until I begged that she changed the letter. After changing it, she started saying things like \"I wrote a beautiful fucking letter and you just made me ruin it\".\n\nI wish I could've had an actual school counselor give a transcript and college recommendation. It would've been done months ago and with way less yelling.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_subscribers":696016,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Applying to college with Nmom","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.84,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/gubmd5\/applying_to_college_with_nmom\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

My partner has wanted to have a child for years, but I'd never been interested before. I finally decided I was ready and it was like a switch turned on in my brain somewhere and all of a sudden I'm baby obsessed. I've planned the nursery, done the budget, and I've been daydreaming about important conversations and plans on how to be a good parent.\n\nLast night I was daydreaming about how to deal with my child being bullied, and what I would say to them. I was thinking about my own experiences.\n\nI had a bully in primary school who'd managed to isolate me from friends I'd known since kindergarten, and who continued to spread stories about me for atleast 6 years after it started. Even as a teenager, I would have people I'd never met come up to me and ask me why I hated this girl whom I hadn't spoken to since I was 11. I realised eventually that this probably wasnt about me, and my friends did realise what was happening after a month or so, but the damage was done. She was my best friend. We were inseparable right up til she changed her mind, and I never found out why. \n\nThis was a time that played on my mind for years. I'm 27 years old and up til last night, even hearing her name made me want to burst into tears. So here I am, in the passenger seat on the way home from my parents house, thinking about how to advise my future child. \n\nIn my mind, I told them that everybody is unique, a combination of a thousand characteristics. There will be people in the world who share hundreds of things with you, and there are people in the world who will only share a few. Being different is OK, it's a chance to learn something new.  Sometimes the things that make you different to someone will be exciting, and fun, and open your world up to hundreds of new experiences, and sometimes the differences will make you sad, confused or scared. \n\nIf a person makes you feel unhappy, you don't have to be near them.

I might have other psychological issues, ie. depression, anxiety problems. I do not know. I never consulted any psychologist\/psychiatrist. I took a few online quizzes out of curiosity and all of them concluded I have depression and anxiety, but I do not feel like it.\n\n\nMy problem is I get scared easily and a lot. There is no specific triggers for it. However, it occurs mostly when I am alone, or at night. I imagine scary stuffs and it scares me.\n\nSome case scenerios:\n\n1.: I am in washroom, taking a shower at midnight. And it would occur to me if I look at mirror and see someone staring at me I would be scared. There is a small window in the washroom, and I imagine that if I look at that window I would see someone watching me. I just cannot shake these thoughts off. And even though I know nothing will happen if I look at the mirror or the window these thoughts just keeps persisting, and increases my chances of hellucinations which freaks me out even more.\n\n2. I am in my room, being the only person awake(I share my room with my brother). I have similar scary thought. I imagine scary situations, that there is a lady with bloody face is standing over the window in the darkness waiting to haunt me. And when these sort of thoughts starts they just keep pouring in, I cannot shake them off. They persists and keeps being worse. I imagine all the scary stories I have read, heard and keep imagining how they could take place there.\n\n\n3. I am in my dorm, keeping late hours to complete assignment, my other 3 room mates are asleep. And I start having such thoughts ie see something scary in the mirror or window. It worsened to such extent that I stopped sleeping at night. Would not go to washroom(shared toilet facility), unless there was anyone else in the toilet. There were days, when I held my urine for hours out of fear, to the point of almost soiling my pant. These condition continues until late morning when most of the dorm is awake. One exception is that I had occassional sleep paralysis episodes at dorm.\n\n4. When I imagine myself driving along the highway alone, then I thought what I would do if I see someone at my backseat through the rear mirror. Or a figure blocking the road.\n\nI thought it would be nice and peaceful to fly a plane alone, then it occured to my mind that I would freak out if I discover someone in my plane mid air.\n\n\n\nMost of the times, these sort of attacks take place at night times when I am the only person awake. It takes place in early mornings as well, until everyone wakes up. Sometimes, it takes place in daytimes as well, mostly when I am alone.\n\nI have been raised in an extended family and have never been alone in the house. Also, when my brother went on a picnic, I could not sleep at night out of fear, as I was alone. And had those thoughts every night. I have never slept at night by myself in any room( even when there were people on the flat ).\n\n\nI do not believe in ghosts, but had some experiences which are unexplainable. \n\nI do not watch horror movies as I get scared and those scenes get itched in my mind. For example one of the scare thoughts I have is a headless guy will rush at me with knife, a horror movie scene I accidentally watched 10 years ago.\n\nI also avoid gore for the most part, I accidentally stumbled upon the picture of a rape-murder victim and that haunted me for months. Although I can tolerate most action movie-ish gore. Saving private ryan seemed okay to me.\n\n\nI read a few horror stories and wear told a few. But I try my best to avoid them. \n\n\nI am extremely sorry for seeking help here. But when such attacks take place I feel helpless, vulnerable and weak. I know I should seek medical help but I am not in such position.\n\nPlease help me.\n\nI will be much obliged for possible diagnosis\/advice.\n\nThank you for taking your time, have a nice day sir.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskPsychiatry","subreddit_id":"t5_3n8fa","subreddit_subscribers":6969,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I get scared a lot.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskPsychiatry\/comments\/gubtzj\/i_get_scared_a_lot\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

It's very apparent that this subreddit has been going by the wayside either due to inactive accounts on the moderator team or my own inability to balance offline responsibilities and digital leadership roles. I'm sorry for mishandling my time, energy, and attention without offering an explanation let alone a solution. You want and deserve a space on the internet to post about one of your favorite shows whether it's your memes, fanart, theories, and (my favorite) breaking news. Not only did this subreddit close down without explanation but you were given no warning. Make no mistake, as I get a little bit real and a little bit vulnerable, this is for the sake of transparency. These are not excuses and cannot be treated as excuses. I\u2019m also not seeking forgiveness either. That\u2019s not for me to ask for and I\u2019d rather just repair.\n\nThis subreddit grew to an overwhelming amount after Enter the Florpus released last year. Prior to *that,* there was an overhaul seemingly overnight to Reddit's UI for both viewers and moderators. That alone had intensified an already challenging role at a time where my life was changing in profound and private ways.\n\n[\/r\/InvaderZim](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/InvaderZim) was a responsibility offered to me when I was in college. It was quiet, small, and people were popping in and out due to nostalgia or the hopes of a revival rather than the amazing sudden influx of new Invader Zim stories.\n\nBack in college it was... Well\u2026.. It was college. I had courses that were either easy to just do last minute cram work for an exam or arriving to a small little theater to be emotionally vulnerable in front of a dozen people after breakfast. There was also a work-study student job for me to sit around and be on the computer while awaiting new tasks from my bosses when I barely had homework. As you could see, I had lots of free time.\n\nThis was also back when the big topics and communities were more vested in providing experiences, services, content, etc.\n\nInvadercon attendance planning (panels mostly), assisting with Soapy Waffles' mailbag, co-adminning Operation Head Pigeons, and coordinating Project Massive was already feeling like my full time job so, sure, I'll run [\/r\/InvaderZim](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/InvaderZim), too, if it helps me advocate to bring the show back. There wasn't a huge surge of activity and the regular contributors were easily self-moderating, and I really had just needed to step in when an occasional abuse of Reddiquette took place. Otherwise I was just one of you. We talked about Invader Zim and occasionally I tell someone to not be rude. Easy peesy.\n\nThis was a bare bones subreddit and we were okay with it because *even with rumblings of an Invader Zim revival on the horizon*, there wasn't a need for this space to be fancy or detailed.\n\nHonestly, I think I was 21 or 22 when I was at my most active. I'm 29 now. Operation Head Pigeons admin were not expecting to need to wait years for new Zim for it to finally happen when we become full time adults.\n\nI'd like to be semi-transparent about mental health, too. My diagnosis is frankly no one's business but it's been apparent that I used my fanprojects and hobbies to put off the suffocating uncertainty to even figuring out how to be more responsible and self-reliant let alone being the adult I needed to be.Some call that anxiety. Others call it executive dysfunction. A little bit of column A, a little bit of column B.\n\nit's become more apparent that in order to get my life in order, other hobbies would suffer.\n\nand then..... *Enter the Florpus.*\n\nY'all came out in droves with passion and excitement. College-age me would be living for this. If I could get in a time machine and find me at the campus radio station bar parties with my friends, I'd high five him and say \"It took longer than you wanted but you won\u201d and of *course* I\u2019d show him what a new generation of fans look like in 2020.\n\nBut now... I'm exhausted. Not to over dramatize it but it's been like The Dark Knight Rises for me. I'm older and less capable and the battle is over and there's not much to do or say. And then new things I don't understand like a new Reddit UI or a new generation of bright, passionate, unique children come forth who just want to ..... post weird lewds of Gaz (I was partly kidding but it's happened. Kids, seriously, do your*selves* a favor and knock that the fuck off\u2026. *Please*)\n\nI digress. I announced that we needed new mods\u2026..about a year ago.\n\nPlenty were interested. You came to me, you decided to shoot your shot. And I'm deeply grateful that every single one of you who expressed interest had put your best foot forward. But I did *not* tighten the funnel of qualifications enough. Then I got overwhelmed.\n\n\"These fans love Zim and are compassionate, but do I have the time to interview them about subreddit maintenance?\"\n\n\"These are experienced with all sorts of Reddit functionality, but do I have time to vet their account for warning signs of a bad cultural fit like transphobia or systemically racist behavior? What values go away if I choose poorly?\"\n\n\"These have compassion, maturity, insight, and fan fever but... they don\u2019t seem active. Too busy? Easily burned out like me?\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t aimed at any particular people. These were common trends. You came out in droves.\n\nIn retrospect all I had to do was ask friends to help. \"Hey, can you look through a few of these redditers' history and tell me what you think of them?\"\n\nI could have picked 3 and scheduled a Discord interview.\n\nBut I think that I got overwhelmed especially by how many were children (who I am truly glad expressed interest, mind you) *but unfortunately were* ***giving me very little to work with*** on what I could expect from them. I saw a small sample of passion and interest. But I couldn't gauge maturity. I just knew you liked the show and want to help. Which is terrific. Never stop wanting to help. I let you down by not giving you the tools to show me what I need to see. It didn't hurt to ask me if you could help. So please never lose interest in taking leadership roles in this fandom. There were so many cool projects whether it was back the OG fansites in \u201901-\u201803 and the revival wave in '10-'12. The Netflix and Oni Press era we're in now will surely inspire fans who need your help and you'll grow with them. If you messaged me about interest... then please feel free to tell me about other Zim stuff you get involved in. Just as two fans talking. I want to cheer you on. Just as I wanted people to support me in what I did for this community about a decade ago with a dozen *amazing* young guys, gals, and nonbinary pals.Why?\n\nbecause Operation Head Pigeons was founded by children. I just happened to be a young adult that earned their trust with something precious to them.\n\n\"Okay, Ginger\\_Shepherd, it's been a year though\u201dYes, and I tried starting afresh on a subreddit dedicated to finding new leaders.\u201cWell, ginger\\_shepherd, so what about the month or so of silence after *that?\u201d*\n\nSorry. In short let's just chalk that up to this: my family needed me. It's not my place to talk about it but here's some clues: we're all highly susceptible to dying of the virus. My grandmother has dementia. My mother is the sole caretaker. And that's the surface of the problems.\n\nI'm sorry that I didn't keep you in the loop in the details that I could about finding new mods.\n\n\u201cWell you shut down the subreddit without explanation\u201dYeah\u2026. This is a global trauma the world is going through right now. I hope you\u2019ll understand. It was a lapse in judgment and I am still unpacking why I did it without a warning let alone any reassurance that [r\/InvaderZim](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/InvaderZim\/) WILL come back.\n\nWhich is heartbreaking when the Invader Zim community has meant so much to me. That\u2019s a bigger failure of responsibility. If you love something and you can\u2019t take care of it then maybe you don\u2019t deserve to keep it.\n\nAnyways... I finally picked a few moderators. I'll still be around and am going to be in reach for them.\n\nPlease give them the same respect and care you've shown me.\n\n\\~Love,CB Johnny\n\n**TL;DR**New mods are coming who have the time, energy, insight, and passion to lead a space for a new generation of Invader Zim fans. I dropped the ball for the past year because of an inability to balance personal struggles with fan-life. Thank you to everyone who expressed interest in modding. The door isn't closed to opportunities here (or elsewhere!).  \n\n\nedit: hope you all are hanging in there.
