On paper it looks the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I workout my chest with 1 exercise everyday over 3 days (changing up the exercise) it is the same on paper as if I just did 3 chest exercises on Monday and then targeted other groups the rest of the week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anybody have any links or personal info on which is better? Pros and cons of each? Does it even matter?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For question purposes I am 5 ft 11, 205 lbs, probably about 18%BMI but steadily dropping weight/gaining muscle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1314917829,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

I am 6'4\" tall.  I've lost nearly 160 pounds in two years.\n\n\nI think that people really only get into our level of heaviness when there is a psychological thing and a physical thing going on.  We have slower metabolisms, and we're lazier, and more, but the HUGE elephant in the room that people don't talk about is that overeating makes us feel better in the moment.  We have other things going on in our lives that eating makes better for those few minutes that we're eating.  When you diet, you're taking all those bad feelings that you used to erase with food and you're ADDING more bad feelings from the deprival of the things you like as well as the escape you used food for.    \n\n\nLiterally hundreds of times I'd promise myself to keep down to 2000 calories a day and work out 4x a week and end up failing after three weeks because it was hard to change my lifestyle in such a short time.\n\n\n\n\nSome background about me, maybe you're like this too....\n\nI have never been thin.  I wasn't too big though when I was younger, just a small belly.  For guys who are naturally a little heavier, putting on muscle and getting stronger is EASY.  I can increase my biceps by an inch in a few months, with working out.  Even when I haven't worked out in years, my muscles are larger and more defined (under all the lard) than most guys who spend hours a day in the gym.  For people with faster metabolisms, naturally skinny people, they can eat 6,000 calories a day and workout twice a day and barely see any gains.  Its HARD for them to get bigger.  When a lot of people complain about fat people being lazy, they are people who have naturally in tune metabolisms, I think.  They should compare the battle fat people having with losing weight to the battle skinny people have with gaining muscle.  \n\n\nIts NOT easy to lose weight for heavy people, any more than its easy to gain muscle for skinny people, but I digress, when I was in high school I played sports, so I was exercising 6 hours a day every day, year round.  I spent time in the gym when I wasn't actively on a team or training for a competition.  I played football, tennis, wrestling, martial arts, and basketball.  I live in Vegas so I did a lot of this stuff in 115 degree heat.  When I was living like this, I could literally eat ANYTHING I wanted.  It was awesome, but it led me into some bad habits.  I could eat insane things (One time I ate an entire sausage and pepperoni stuffed crust pizza, a 2 liter of cherry coke, a large bag of doritos, a gallon of water, and a vienetta ice cream cake, the WHOLE THING, in less than 1.5 hours.  It was basically my dinner for the night.  I'd regularly eat 3 double whoppers for lunch.) and pay no price.  Because of this, I taught myself over time that I could eat away boredom, sadness, pain, or more.  It was my always there reward, my drug of choice that would load me up with dopamine.  I'd always work it off later that day, and I was big, strong, and fast enough to play starting ironman lineman in high school football.\n\n\n\n\nThen, the sports stopped, I wasn't good enough to make it at the collegiate level, and I didn't want to anyways, but my body was used to being bombarded with fat, salt, and sugar.  I still craved the things I ate before, and within a few years I had gained nearly 200 pounds. \n\nInsane right?  How can someone gain 200 pounds and not put the brakes on?  When you're not living a healthy lifestyle you don't bother weighing yourself or really even paying attention to your body, because it makes you feel depressed and guilty, and while I knew I had gained weight, I didn't know how much I had gained.  When someone (my boss, who actually declined giving me a bonus at work one year because I was getting too fat and he said I'd spend it on food.  He was right, but wow) mentioned my weight gain, I checked the scale and was distraught.\n\n\nI began my journey.  After losing 75 pounds, I asked my mother if she noticed my weight loss and she said no.  When you're big, losing huge amounts or gaining huge amounts just might not show.  I felt a lot better and could play tennis for an hour or two instead of the 25 minutes I could tolerate at 445.  Here is how I lost that first 75, and the next 75 too.  I've got another 75 to go.\n\n\nThe best way to do it is make small changes, one or two at a time. Many people will tell you that you need to transform your life, but in my opinion, unless you've got great willpower and an awesome attitude and work ethic (lets be real, if you had those you wouldn't be where you are) then you're setting yourself up to fail or at least fall short.\n\n\nUsing a small/incremental plan will lessen the bad feelings of deprivation and lessen your feeling sorry and make you feel more like its not a big deal, and nothing to think about.  If you only have to stop eating curry, then you can have something else.  It doesn't feel that bad.  If you have to stop doing all of the food related stuff you like, its pretty depressing.  The great thing is that over time, the incremental thing just leads you onto the right path, where you don't even bother feeling sorry for yourself because you make the right choices easily and WITHOUT the feeling of depriving yourself.  The more right choices you make, the better you feel.  Not only are you more proud of yourself, leading to a better feeling about you, but your body is healthier and your depressing feelings get to be less and less a part of your daily experience, and this helps you from feeling bad enough emotionally to eat poorly.  Its a great feedback loop, its super easy, and anyone can do it.\n\n\nI was 445 pounds, I'm down to 287 now, with another 70ish to go. My first (and the most important one of all) step of many was : just be sensible, don't get ridiculous things like double bacon cheeseburgers with extra cheese and fries with ranch and onion rings and soda and a milkshake. Just get a regular burger and some fruit. Its fine and you won't feel nasty or guilty when you're done.  No matter what you do, do NOT tell yourself \"I will be going on a diet next week, I better eat all the things I love now, because its all over next week!\"  Any sensible person has a cheat meal every week where you can tell your body that the calorie restriction isn't permanent and it can continue to burn calories all it wants because there are tons of calories on the way.\n\n\nOnce you've made that crucial change in your thought process, then you start making incremental changes. For me, this meant, at first, that I'd stop eating fast food. The second step, three weeks later, was to stop eating mayo on my sandwiches and to avoid yellow cheeses. After that, I went from a 6 pack of soda per day to one soda per day, with dinner. Then, I started having breakfast and didn't eat after 9pm. I made a lot of these kinds of small changes and the weight came off effortlessly.\n\n\nI have NEVER gained any of my weight back, because I was making lifestyle changes, not going on a diet. The way I eat and exercise now is just a part of my life, and doesn't take special attention or require myself to deny anything, apart from the first few weeks after I make the change. The changes are so small, I don't feel like I am missing out on too much, and I don't feel like I am depriving myself, so I avoid falling back into my old ways, or binging.\n\n\nOnce I hit 300 I plateau'd for two months, and I am going to have to start making bigger changes now. Since I've had so much positive reinforcement, though, it seems much, much less daunting to take some of these bigger steps.  The changes I made before have had such an effect on me that I find it much easier to enjoy my time in the gym, or on the court, and I am able to take a look at a Carl's JR. Western Bacon Cheeseburger and say \"no thanks, I don't want to get that full.\"  I'm not saying \"OH MAN I WANT THAT!  But I can't.\"  I'm saying \"I don't really want that, I'll have something else.\"  The difference in attitude is staggering for my outlook and my health, and it is all coming naturally as an extension of the small changes and the feedback I get from my own mind and body when I enact those small changes.\n\n\nThe key, the biggest one, is to make SMALL changes. You won't see crazy results once the initial shock wears off (I bet you'll lose 10 lbs right away even making small changes) but your life will be manageable and you'll never feel sad or deprived and it will lead you right into the exact place you need to be to maintain a healthy weight for the rest of your life....a healthy lifestyle!\n\n\nI don't have a weight loss buddy. I've been doing it all myself. Today is my first day on /r/loseit.  I met a new friend after a comment, and started writing stuff because it felt nice to give someone the simple method I used and know they might use it and find it as simple to lose weight as I did.  Once I wrote it, it became insanely long and I decided to post it for everyone to read.  I hope it inspires someone.  It made me feel good to write it.\n\n\nTL;DR : don't worry about changing everything all at once, make small changes, and after a few years your lifestyle will have sorted itself out!\n\nEDIT : Someone asked for some before and after pics.  I have a great before pic, because it was within a week of my making my change, but my after pic is a few months ago so its 40 pounds heavier than I am now.  My wife is out of town this weekend to photograph a wedding (she's a pro photographer, I'm super proud of her, if you're in Vegas PM me and I'll send you her website) but when she gets back I'll put up a more current shot.\n\n[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/k1orb/today_is_my_first_day_on_rloseit_this_is_my_story/c2h2770) is my comment with my before and after.\n\nIf ANY of you want to talk about this stuff, feel free to PM me any time.  I have Skype and Gtalk and MSN and Facebook and all that jazz.  I didn't know how much I'd enjoy reading all your stories and advice.

When you&amp;#39;re not living a healthy lifestyle you don&amp;#39;t bother weighing yourself or really even paying attention to your body, because it makes you feel depressed and guilty, and while I knew I had gained weight, I didn&amp;#39;t know how much I had gained.  When someone (my boss, who actually declined giving me a bonus at work one year because I was getting too fat and he said I&amp;#39;d spend it on food.  He was right, but wow) mentioned my weight gain, I checked the scale and was distraught.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began my journey.  After losing 75 pounds, I asked my mother if she noticed my weight loss and she said no.  When you&amp;#39;re big, losing huge amounts or gaining huge amounts just might not show.  I felt a lot better and could play tennis for an hour or two instead of the 25 minutes I could tolerate at 445.  Here is how I lost that first 75, and the next 75 too.  I&amp;#39;ve got another 75 to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best way to do it is make small changes, one or two at a time. Many people will tell you that you need to transform your life, but in my opinion, unless you&amp;#39;ve got great willpower and an awesome attitude and work ethic (lets be real, if you had those you wouldn&amp;#39;t be where you are) then you&amp;#39;re setting yourself up to fail or at least fall short.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using a small/incremental plan will lessen the bad feelings of deprivation and lessen your feeling sorry and make you feel more like its not a big deal, and nothing to think about.  If you only have to stop eating curry, then you can have something else.  It doesn&amp;#39;t feel that bad.  If you have to stop doing all of the food related stuff you like, its pretty depressing.  The great thing is that over time, the incremental thing just leads you onto the right path, where you don&amp;#39;t even bother feeling sorry for yourself because you make the right choices easily and WITHOUT the feeling of depriving yourself.  The more right choices you make, the better you feel.  Not only are you more proud of yourself, leading to a better feeling about you, but your body is healthier and your depressing feelings get to be less and less a part of your daily experience, and this helps you from feeling bad enough emotionally to eat poorly.  Its a great feedback loop, its super easy, and anyone can do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was 445 pounds, I&amp;#39;m down to 287 now, with another 70ish to go. My first (and the most important one of all) step of many was : just be sensible, don&amp;#39;t get ridiculous things like double bacon cheeseburgers with extra cheese and fries with ranch and onion rings and soda and a milkshake. Just get a regular burger and some fruit. Its fine and you won&amp;#39;t feel nasty or guilty when you&amp;#39;re done.  No matter what you do, do NOT tell yourself &amp;quot;I will be going on a diet next week, I better eat all the things I love now, because its all over next week!&amp;quot;  Any sensible person has a cheat meal every week where you can tell your body that the calorie restriction isn&amp;#39;t permanent and it can continue to burn calories all it wants because there are tons of calories on the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve made that crucial change in your thought process, then you start making incremental changes. For me, this meant, at first, that I&amp;#39;d stop eating fast food. The second step, three weeks later, was to stop eating mayo on my sandwiches and to avoid yellow cheeses. After that, I went from a 6 pack of soda per day to one soda per day, with dinner. Then, I started having breakfast and didn&amp;#39;t eat after 9pm. I made a lot of these kinds of small changes and the weight came off effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have NEVER gained any of my weight back, because I was making lifestyle changes, not going on a diet. The way I eat and exercise now is just a part of my life, and doesn&amp;#39;t take special attention or require myself to deny anything, apart from the first few weeks after I make the change. The changes are so small, I don&amp;#39;t feel like I am missing out on too much, and I don&amp;#39;t feel like I am depriving myself, so I avoid falling back into my old ways, or binging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I hit 300 I plateau&amp;#39;d for two months, and I am going to have to start making bigger changes now. Since I&amp;#39;ve had so much positive reinforcement, though, it seems much, much less daunting to take some of these bigger steps.  The changes I made before have had such an effect on me that I find it much easier to enjoy my time in the gym, or on the court, and I am able to take a look at a Carl&amp;#39;s JR. Western Bacon Cheeseburger and say &amp;quot;no thanks, I don&amp;#39;t want to get that full.&amp;quot;  I&amp;#39;m not saying &amp;quot;OH MAN I WANT THAT!  But I can&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;  I&amp;#39;m saying &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t really want that, I&amp;#39;ll have something else.&amp;quot;  The difference in attitude is staggering for my outlook and my health, and it is all coming naturally as an extension of the small changes and the feedback I get from my own mind and body when I enact those small changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key, the biggest one, is to make SMALL changes. You won&amp;#39;t see crazy results once the initial shock wears off (I bet you&amp;#39;ll lose 10 lbs right away even making small changes) but your life will be manageable and you&amp;#39;ll never feel sad or deprived and it will lead you right into the exact place you need to be to maintain a healthy weight for the rest of your life....a healthy lifestyle!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have a weight loss buddy. I&amp;#39;ve been doing it all myself. Today is my first day on &lt;a href=\"/r/loseit\"&gt;/r/loseit&lt;/a&gt;.  I met a new friend after a comment, and started writing stuff because it felt nice to give someone the simple method I used and know they might use it and find it as simple to lose weight as I did.  Once I wrote it, it became insanely long and I decided to post it for everyone to read.  I hope it inspires someone.  It made me feel good to write it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR : don&amp;#39;t worry about changing everything all at once, make small changes, and after a few years your lifestyle will have sorted itself out!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT : Someone asked for some before and after pics.  I have a great before pic, because it was within a week of my making my change, but my after pic is a few months ago so its 40 pounds heavier than I am now.  My wife is out of town this weekend to photograph a wedding (she&amp;#39;s a pro photographer, I&amp;#39;m super proud of her, if you&amp;#39;re in Vegas PM me and I&amp;#39;ll send you her website) but when she gets back I&amp;#39;ll put up a more current shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/k1orb/today_is_my_first_day_on_rloseit_this_is_my_story/c2h2770\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is my comment with my before and after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If ANY of you want to talk about this stuff, feel free to PM me any time.  I have Skype and Gtalk and MSN and Facebook and all that jazz.
