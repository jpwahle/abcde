{"selftext":"Hi guys, I've been browsing this sub for a long time and have been taken the advice on the sidebar as well as the recent posts on the page. Through lots of trial and error between different routines, I got rid of most of my acne, however, I'm always stuck with some sort of acne on my face. It is frustrating because I put so much effort into my diet and my routine and somehow with everything going perfect, I'm still getting acne. I tried routines with a lot more stuff, but I realized that the more I put on my skin, the worse it got. It actually got better after I stopped putting stuff on my skin and let my skin do it's thing with minimal cleansing.\n\nHere is an album of my skin right now. http://imgur.com/a/TY89J (This may be out of place, but I took these pictures right after I had intercourse, my skin always looks more inflamed after sex...)\n\nI have normal to oily skin. I am 21 years old. I live in southern Canada. I am in a pretty high stress university program, I tend to get more pimples during the stressful times for sure.\n\nRoutine:\nAM: \nWash Face with LukeWarm Water Hawaian Tropic Sunscreen 60SPF (Just a little!) http://www.hawaiiantropic.com/sun-care-products/hawaiian-tropic-sheer-touch-ultra-radiance-lotion-sunscreen\n\nPM: \n//I sometimes cleanse with a gentle cleanser(maybe a few times a week) \nClean skin with Stridex Pads Mosturize with Cerave PM Cream (http://www.cerave.ca/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion)\n\nAside from this, I exercise at least an hour everyday. I drink 8 glasses of water a day. I take a men's multivitamin and Fish Oil supplements daily.\nI have tried AHA lotion, Vit C Serum, but no method has given me exactly what my skin needs.\n\nI am about to try OCM (My Mixture is Caster Oil 30% + Extra Virgin Olive Oil 70% + Hints of Jojoba and Tamanu Oil). Have any of you had my type of skin and have had OCM work for you? I am also going to add drops of VIT C serum at night.\n\nDo you guys have an advice for me to stop this redness! I have some PIH from previous breakouts that I believe the Cerave PM moisturizer will help with. Also, any advice on how to stop future breakouts. I have no seen a doctor.

Most of the time, I just experience your average long term nagging depression, I've had a few episodes that seem to border on the side of mania if that makes sense. About a month or so ago, I had one and for a little less than a week I wasn't sleeping and it felt like I had no control over my thoughts and impulses and I was exhibiting behaviors that my parents and friends found to be unusual (I was getting a lot of \"are you okay?\"s from people). I don't really know where I'm going with this and I certainly don't expect a diagnosis via reddit but to anyone that has Bipolar or experience with clinical psychology, can you explain to me how they diagnose bipolar in a clinical setting and the best channels to go about doing so?

{"domain":"self.creepyencounters","selftext":"Let me preface this by saying when this happened I realise I am an idiot. The biggest, most naive idiot in the WORLD. I thought that because I had lived in so many countries and seen so many cultures that I was smarter than I was and more \"grown up\" than my peers. God was I wrong. \n\nSo when the story takes place, I'm 14 and am attending a boarding school in Connecticut (I am female). My family is in Switzerland so I only see them on school holidays. I'm going through my emo phase, moody and pissed at the mainstream and hating how preppy my school is. I make friends with the most \"non-mainstream\" kids I could find there. At 22, I still cringe at my past self. \n\nOne of my friends was dating this \"townie\" who wanted to be a tattoo artist and boy did I want a tattoo and I couldn't wait to turn 18. He agreed to tattoo me as he was just learning and didn't have his license so what harm could happen? Side note I now have a TERRIBLE tattoo but I digress. \n\nWe talk and agree that I'll take the bus to Waterbury and meet him on the green (where all the busses meet and transfer) because I had no idea about the layout of the area as I stayed in the campus bubble. \n\nIf you don't know, Waterbury CT has its nice parts but where I was was GROSS. Shootings happen regularly, crackheads abound, it's not a good part of town but back then I didn't care, I thought I would be fine. \n\nSo it's Saturday, I just finished classes (yup we had Saturday classes) and I'm all excited about getting this tattoo and being ~edgy~. I jump on the bus and text my friend's boyfriend I'm on my way. \n\nFast forward and I'm at the green, waiting for him to get out of his classes. He texts me to say he will be an hour late, great. What the hell am I supposed to do in a shitty part of town, alone. Two hours pass and he says he will be done in a hour. I really wanted this tattoo so I waited.\n\nI had been siting there for probably two and a half hours when I notice this big black SUV pull up and park in the bus drop off zone. This big black guy then comes out, the windows are tinted so I don't know if he is alone, and he sits right next to me. There were loads of empty benches, but he chose the one I was on. Red flag. \n\nI'm dressed in a band tshirt, black skinny jeans with converse, weird colours in my hair, the usual emo regalia. Nothing was revealing but I stuck out. I thought he just wanted to talk to me because I was different. Again, I'm a total idiot. \n\nHe then starts asking me what I'm doing there, where I'm from and how old I am. Because I thought I could take on the world I boldly told him I was just fourteen but more mature than people my age and blah blah blah. Then, things got weirder. His eyes light up when I say my age and asks he if I'm a virgin and if I've ever given anyone a blow job. \n\nThis is where I panic. I stutter and my face gets red, he laughs and puts his hand on my thigh and squeezes. He says I could jump into his car and he'd \"treat me right\" and bring me right back in a few hours. \n\nI don't know what to do or say. I'm looking around for an adult but it was a lull and no buses were there. The man tries to pull me closer to him and I'm terrified. \n\n\"Baby girl it will only be a few hours, let me show you how a real man does it. Ever had a black dick before? Once you go black, you never go back!\" He laughs a deep laugh after this and stares right at me. \n\nI lose it at this point. I'm nauseous and about to cry. He sees this and smiles even more, clearly enjoying how uncomfortable I am. He then gets up and starts pulling my arm to get me up and steer me to his car. I try to resist but it's a 5'8 140 lb girl against a 6'2 250 lb man. \n\nHe starts to get aggressive when I resist and is really pulling me along, I'm about half way to his car when I hear someone yell \"HEY! GET AWAY FROM HER!\" \n\nThe black man lets me go and books it to his car and peels off like he's being chased by the police. He probably thought it was the police to be honest. I look at who saved me and it's a bus driver who was waiting for his shift to start and watching us from the nearby Dunkins. \n\nI just fall to the ground and sob. I've never been approached by anyone like this, never been so close to God knows what awful thing this man could have done to me, I was so helpless. \n\nThe bus driver calls the police and reports the incident giving a partial of the plate and a description. I try my best to give a description of the guy but I was in such shock I don't think I was very useful. I didn't hear anything from it later, I assume they didn't find the guy. \n\nIn the end, I take another bus back to school and don't tell anyone I was nearly abducted and raped or worse. I couldn't stand to have them think I was weak or couldn't take care of myself and I was so embarrassed by what I had gotten myself into so I didn't tell anyone till a year ago. \n\nI'm back in that part of the world and told one of my high school friends when we drove past that exact spot what had happened and she was shocked. I realise just how in debt I am to that bus driver who literally saved me from being at the least abducted. Who knows what that man had in store for me if he got me into his SUV. \n\nI ended up meeting with my friend's boyfriend the weekend after and he made up some bullshit excuse for not meeting me at the agreed upon time, giving me a fake apology. I was so pissed at him that after the terrible tattoo he gave me I never talked to him again.

I'm a teenager myself, I'm 16 years old and have been playing cs for a little less than a year now. I'm currently ranked MGE. Not long after I started playing this game, I quickly fell in love with it and it became my most played game on steam. However, I also quickly discovered the community's vehement hatred towards \"squeakers\" and the players who caused that hatred and the stereotypes it formed. I live on the West Coast of the U.S., and it's entirely possible that different regions have a different experience, but for the most part I find when I play MM, ar least one player on my team is a younger child ranging from age 11 to 14. A few of these players have been polite and fun to play with, but after a while I began to understand the stereotype of the high-voiced child incessantly screaming about memes. I resolved to defy this stereotype. I grew up a voracious reader, and as such have a decent vocabulary, and I'm fairly outgoing, so working as a team in CS has usually been fairly simple. I've also been graced with a fairly deep voice. With all these facts combined, CS is a fairly non toxic environment for me. Most adults that I play with don't really call attention to my age, hopefully due to the fact that I generally stay calm and quiet except when making callouts. I've been lucky enough to be accepted with maturity, but from what I've seen, other people haven't been so lucky. I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this topic, so any stories are greatly appreciated.

She had a not-so-great upbringing, but I was something stable in her unstable life, I was always there for her. We mainly started bonding at the end of high school and after graduation, she is one of the *very* few people I keep in contact with from high school. My other best friend (22F) lives overseas, I get to see her maybe once a year if I'm lucky.\n\nI moved out a year and a half after we graduated, with my best firend that now lives overseas, a year after that I had to renew my lease (and friend had moved to Europe) and decided to move in with Ashley. She decided to move her boyfriend in, who wasn't a big fan of me (we get along fine now). I had no issue with him living there, I had a full time job, they both had part time jobs. It was quickly found out we do not work well as room mates. I am not a perfectly neat person, but my \"dirty\" house is her version of a clean house. Two months after living with her I bought a home and moved into it, alone. This probably saved our friendship a year ago.\n\nThe good things about Ashley; whenever I have a problem she is there to talk me through it, tell me that the boy is stupid, normal best friend things. She has a good sense of humor (when she wants). She does favors for me whenever I ask (as long as they aren't money related, I'll touch on that later). We've been best friends for a very long time and I do love her with all my heart, I want the best for her.\n\nThe bad things...She's broke, all the time. I get it, we're 21, struggling to pay bills. But her broke isn't the normal type of broke. She couldn't afford a ticket to something that I wanted to do for my birthday (which is around Black Friday), so I paid for her and her boyfriend, they said they would pay me back. I didn't get paid back because she was broke. But the next week she bought a new Xbox One. They always buy taco bell, because they can't afford normal food, but don't want to apply for food stamps because she doesn't want to ask for help from the government. She buys in-game purchases all the time. But one time asked me to buy milk for her because she couldn't afford it (I didn't). Tonight (New Years Eve) I asked her to go to a local party with me, that had an admission fee. Surprise, she couldn't afford it.\n\nTonight I pointed out how it sucks that she always seems to be able to afford video game purchases (I am there while she buys stuff in the games!!!) but can't afford to go with me to a fun party. She said she would go if I could buy her ticket, and I said I can't afford two ticket admission prices. Which is a lie, I totally can, but I don't want to. Why is it okay that she buy all these things that aren't necessary, but can't afford milk, or to even have some spending money to go have fun on New Years? She told me she can't afford to pay rent next month because she spent too much on presents for everyone (I didn't get a present?). I told her I would go with someone else, and her boyfriend started texting me asking why I was acting like this, I didn't respond. She was very upset I said that, but what else am I supposed to say? Does she want me to buy all her drinks too once we're inside??? I also one time tried to get her attention by tapping her shoulder and she got super pissy and asked why I hit her (????), whenever I try to say a joke she gets super upset over it also. She invited me over one time and instead of spending time with me, she played video games on the computer while I sat on the couch with her boyfriend and watched a movie. She didn't say a word to me until I left. I invite her over, but she says she doesn't want to leave her computer, she's busy, it's cold, etc. Then one time I had a small party for someone's birthday and she asked me why I didn't invite her over more........ She has apologized for her cranky behavior lately.\n\nLike I said, I do love her, but I am getting tired of her not growing up I guess? I am 21, but I own my house, I usually don't party (tonight would be a nice exception to go out and have a good time). I pay all my bills on time, I have a good job for someone my age. She tells me that she hates working, she doesn't keep her house clean. I am starting to feel we are just turning into two different people and it's starting to become hard to stay friends with someone that acts like her. I don't know if I should keep trying to stay friends with her or just slowly fade out of her life. I don't have many other friends, my only other close friend isn't 21, and has a kid so him and his girlfriend don't \"go out\". \n\n**tl;dr**: Best friend seems to be a completely different person than me, and at a different point in her life, I feel we are slowly drifting apart anyways.

I don't mind it much, I'm not the type to go out and party/drinking anyway. \n\nI don't know what I'm looking for. Someone to talk to would be nice. If anything else stems from it, then that's awesome. You never know, so I figured it's worth a shot.\n\nAnyway, I'm 22 and attending college to be a forensic technician. I'd love to travel, specifically Europe and Asia at some point when it's not so financially straining. I'm cynical but in a sarcastic way. Board games and playing cards (euchre, hearts, those types) are some of my favorite things to do when you have enough people or I'm visiting family. \n\nAs for things I'm interested in and spend most of my time doing:\n\nLet me preface this by saying I'm pretty nerdy. I'm not really talking about it in a hipster way either, I'm pretty passionate about some geeky stuff. \n\nI *love* anime. I could talk about it for hours. Like... wall scrolls in my apartment, trying to learn Japanese, otaku status. But I'd like to think it's not in a weird way. Nobody knows I'm into it until I tell them or they ask, if you get what I mean. I'm not going to throw it in your face if it's not your thing, I understand it's a niche group.\n\nI also love sports. Football, basketball, and hockey mainly. I watch my favorite teams play any time I can and I'm pretty passionate about it. \n\nLastly, I'm a gamer. I've played just about everything you can think of at some point. My two favorite types are MMORPGs and FPS. Right now I spend a lot of time on CS:GO, but I've put countless hours into FF and RuneScape back in the day.\n\nI feel like a lot of people PM these posters and end up wanting to see what they look like, only to have them not be what you expected/wanted, so I'm going to eliminate that part and just show you what I look like: http://i.imgur.com/V2Z9Fbn.jpg\n\nI'm like 5'11'', dirty blondish curly hair, average weight.\n\nIf you're as bored as I am and want to talk, we can do it on here or I also have kik.

I need to find a way to save $2000 in 2 months. The following provides a pretty in depth look at my current financial situation.\n\nI will be grateful for any additional feedback beyond that relating to the 2 grand. I just need some help.\n\nPlease try and withhold judgement while considering my situation; I am really not a dumb person, but I have made some very dumb mistakes. I'm being brutally honest here. If you read this whole thing, I really appreciate it. This is the first time I've really laid out exactly how I got into my current situation.\n\nI am 21 years old and have $20,000 in student loan debt, $12,000 in credit card debt, have pending misdemeanor charges, and am completely desperate for some guidance.\n\n**Spring 2012 - Fall 2013**\n\nI graduated 3rd of my 400+ high school graduating class. I scored over 2300 on the SAT and a 35 on the ACT. I was accepted to Berkeley but decided against enrolling there due to cost. I was an unmotivated, yet lovable troublemaker who smoked weed before, during, and after school, and slept through half of my classes as an upperclassman. High school was a breeze to me, and I thought I was the shit for being so smart.\n\nIn fall 2013, I enrolled in an expensive 4-year university. I do not come from money, and despite receiving around $6,000 per semester from grants/scholarships/financial aid, I still needed about $7,000 more per semester. No biggy, parents have great credit, they cosigned on 3 different loans which totaled $32,500 to get me through the first 2 years.\n\nI joined a fraternity during my first semester and quickly lost sight of the real reason I was at school. By the end of that semester my GPA was a 3.0, thanks to the university's grade-exemption policy which gave me the chance to exempt the 2 classes I failed from my GPA. By the end of the 2nd semester I had acquired a pretty heavy adderall addiction and was placed on academic probation for failing to keep my GPA above a 2.5. \n\nMy parents weren't happy, but I assured them that I was gonna pull it all together the following semester. I believed this myself and was looking forward to a fresh start. I had quit the fraternity and was living with who I thought were pretty straight edge guys the next year. I went and got myself an adderall prescription prior to beginning my third semester. I had gone the whole summer without it and was confident in my ability to use responsibly.\n\nI soon learned my \"straight edge\" suite mates all liked drugs as much as I did but had a lot more control over it. I became a self-proclaimed junky during this time period. Never went to class, never showered, never ate, and just really just didn't care anymore. I found ways to take advantage of my automatically-refilling meal dollars so I always had cash for whatever. Sold weed on the side out of the suite. Failed out after not passing any classes.\n\n**Early 2014**\n\nUpon returning home, I picked back up at the job I had in high school and quickly (the time was just right) worked my way up into a $35,000/year position paid salary. After scheming the drug test on some 007-type shit that I am admittedly very proud of, I was caking in at a job I knew better than the back of my hand and hired all of my friends to come work for/with me. It was awesome, my numbers were great, all the other experienced GMs were jealous, and I could do no wrong in my bosses eyes. Plus, we had an unlimited supply of 30mg IRs (the good shit). We were living the dream of 20 year old fast food workers. \n\nAfter a year, the 80 hour adderall-fueled workweeks responsible for my great work production began to get to me. I began resenting the place and blaming it for unescapable depressive state. This stemmed more adderall use. My friends/employees started to notice I had a problem. After a 2 week binge of adderall, alcohol, pot, nitrous, and a half-sheet of Lucy. This all took place either in the store itself or in my car parked out back (I didn't go home at all these two weeks, I was too fucked up to drive the 15 min home by the end of the day), me and my best manager/friend both decided we were gonna quit and get clean. I had a pretty large amount of money saved up, and I told him I would support him for a month or so while we did this. No two weeks or anything, we called my boss tripping our tails off and told her we wouldn't be at work the next day.\n\n**Early 2015**\n\nWe cleaned ourselves up from our DOC and were living off the money I had saved. We were partying almost every night, partly to stay off the amphetamines. Soon, that money was gone, and I wasn't going to be able to pay rent. I landscape during the summers, but this was late spring. I went to the bank to try to get some overdraft fees reversed, and they told me I might want to look into getting a credit card with the bank. I had been paying back my student loans for over 6 months and had financed a car in high school without missing a payment. My credit was pretty good. I was approved for a $10,000 line of credit with 0% apr for the first 18 months. I just had to pay the minimum payment of 2% the current balance... \"Wait, what?!\" \n\n**June 2015**\n\nTook a cross country trip, spent $2,000 in Vegas, and was making a lot of money with my landscaping business. I never put any of the cash I earned in the bank and used the credit card for all of my purchases, so my checking account balance stayed pretty constant. \n\n**September 2015**\n\nMaxed out my credit card, the grass isn't growing anymore, I don't have any money left to pay my bills. I begin driving for Uber but need money for gas to start, so I apply for another credit card to use for gas. And then another one. I have enough for my bills and gas the upcoming week, but not enough to pay off the balances on the cards. I start ignoring their existence after I max them out.\n\n**October 2015 - Now**\n\nMe and my roommates are drinking and watching football around noon on a Saturday, pulling straight out of half gallon of rum. I drove all night and was planning on getting real drunk and passing out while watching the games. \n\nI drank too much too fast, blacked out, and was found by police down the street from my house playing my electric guitar. They call me an ambulance and I refuse the ride. Protocol in this situation is an arrest. I refuse the be arrested as well. They hit me with resisting arrest. While in the holding cell, I become upset and start cursing at the officers. According to one of the guards, every time I told the magistrate to go fuck himself, he raised my bond a grand and then secured it at $5,000 dollars. They added disorderly conduct/defacing a public building. Apparently, I was having trouble pulling down my pants to piss (I was handcuffed) and asked for assistance. When they didn't, I pissed on the floor of the cell. Classy, right? I woke up the next day in 23 hour lockdown with no idea how I got there. I spent 3 more days there before being released pretrial with no bond. The charges are still pending, I haven't gone to court. This is my 2nd time in trouble, 1st arrest.\n\nFor the past 3 months I've been sober but struggling. I've succeeded in deferring my student loans but still have $800+ in bills a month, not including food. Uber is just not cutting it, and I need to find a real job. A good one at that. My lawyer keeps continuing my case in the hope that it will be thrown out. He's a respected man around town and says that I wasn't doing anything illegal, was lucid while interacting with the officer (per arrest report), and was a resisting an arrest that was unnecessary to begin with, as I lived within eyesight of my home. Until my case is settled, no one will hire me. I've had 5 good/great interviews in December, all for jobs which I am more than qualified. I was honest about my arrest in all of them and the interviewers seemed sincerely empathetic and understanding. Still, I haven't gotten a call back. These are jobs that pay no more than $9/hour.\n\nBasically, I'm lost. I have another 5 months until I can start landscaping again. I am making about $1000/month working over full time with Uber. The deferment period on my loans is up in January. My credit is absolutely destroyed at around a 450. I need to be able to pay these student loan bills at all cost; I don't want my stupidity to damage my parents' credit. I have $0 in emergency funds. The minimum payment on my $10,000 credit card is $1,750 to bring it current, and I have about 2 months to pay it before they close the account. This is my number 1 priority right now.\n\nBasically, I have 2 months to save $2000 while only making $1000/month. I will literally do anything to achieve this. Any ideas?","domain":"self.personalfinance"}

Over the years I've tried different scrubs, nose strips, extracting them, nothing works I've got maybe two out but they always come back.\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated!","domain":"self.SkincareAddiction"}

I miss flirting &amp;amp; having someone to talk to all the time, sharing things that I am passionate about, &amp;amp; just, in general, being close to someone. \n\nMy personality could be summed as INTJ, mostly introverted, melancholic, but kind and friendly. I like gaming, books, movies, programming (Java, C#, C++, C) and talking. I can be really shy but once I get comfortable, I love to talk about anything. When it comes to music, my spectrum is quite wide - trap, deep house, dubstep, chillstep, classical, rock, etc. I'm huge fan of MMORPG's, RPG's, open world action games, survival, racing...simply whatever catches my attention. I don't strictly have 1 favorite game, I rather have list of my top games. That'd consist of KotOR, Saint's row 4, Fallout 4, Skyrim, Minecraft. \n\nI'm a super nerd, &amp;amp; am really into science fiction &amp;amp; fantasy. Whether it be books, movies, Television, video games, tabletop games, etc., If it is scifi/fantasy, I'm more than likely interested in it. A few examples are: Star Wars, Star Trek, LotR, D&amp;amp;D (recently started playing &amp;amp; love it), Titansgrave (show &amp;amp; Rpg); you get the idea. \n\nI'm not that kind of person that'd consider looks as top 1 factor but I believe they matter at least a bit, so I will include a photo of myself in my reply. I am 5' 11\" tall, 170lbs with an average body (not thin/muscular, but not fat, either), have brown, short hair (similar to Chris Pine's Kirk), with a small goatee, and blue/grey eyes.\n\nSo, what I'm looking for? First of all you should be at least a bit similar to me in things above mentioned. You should have enough time to devote to bonding, lol. I really like talking, eventually, but I'm a little mic shy in the beginning. I also can get really assign are about things, and sometimes just want someone to listen to my ideas. Hopefully, this will be okay, and it won't be an issue and we'll want to talk a lot, haha. Someone who genuinely wants to know me, be close with me, &amp; would enjoy flirting.  Please do include your photo, if you don't mind. No real preference, but I believe a physical attraction is important in a potential relationship. \n\nWell, that's all I can think of at the moment, so if you think we'd get along just send me a reply. If you have any questions, feel free to ask! Please no short messages, I like to read! \n","domain":"self.r4r","author_flair_text":null,"link_flair_css_class":"M4F","subreddit_id":"t5_2rn0e"}

Why? Let me explain to you exactly why you would be making a huge mistake coming to this shit hole.\n\nKiwis are the most boring, backward, insular minded, thick as shit, humorless tossers I have ever had the misfortune of conversing with. Crack a joke about New Zealand or take the piss in any way, especially slagging off the all blacks, and they will take it very personally. I have never once, in my 6 years in this hell hole, had a decent conversation with a kiwi. Thank god I met a fellow Brisbanite who shared the same feelings as me and has an amazing sense of humour. (As us Brisbanite's do.)\n\nNew Zealand is an absolute rip off. Not only are you constantly being ripped off, but the things you pay for are utter rubbish. The food is abysmal here. THe Chinese take aways etc are GARBAGE. Shit shit and SHIT. You are paying through your arse for sub standard quality. Also, anything electronic you might buy from a shop like Harvey Norman or Bond and Bond will most likely falter after a short while leaving you gobsmacked at paying the rip off prices and having to go through the hassle of getting the warranty to fix it after such a short period.\n\nYou can look forward to seeing mental thick as shit islanders with a chip on their shoulders acting like gangsters and hating on pakeha (whites).\n\nDrivers here are absolute cretins. Be prepared to experience wankers up your arse and over taking full speed in pouring rain and indicating at the last minute. They also love to pull out infront of you then crawl at a snails pace.\n\nHouses here seem to be made of ****ing plywood or cardboard. THey are terrible. Even in winter ive seen kiwis have several windows open in the house and most kiwi homes ive been into are bloody ice boxes.\n\nWages here are shit too. Forget about being a skilled migrant nad being more than over qualified for a job but having some slack jawed prick with zero skills be your boss because they are related to the company owner. You overseas qualification count for diddly squat here. Its who you know around here.\n\nNEVER, EVER live in Christchurch if you really have to come and live in New Zealand. It was shite before the earthquakes, now its a cemetery with lights.\n\n\"Why dont you **** off back to Ascot then, you whinging Queenslander!!??\" I get told countless times by self rightous, patriotic kiwis. Oh how id love to, but i have a 5 year old son here that makes it hard for me to leave him here and not have my care and attention and influence.\n\nA little about me-I'm 28, Brisbanite, obviously from Brisbane, ive been in NZ for 6 ish or so years, i came to see my family out here when they emigrated. I met a kiwi woman, we were together for a while, we had a son together, and it was a big mistake. Not my son, but having a child with a kiwi. UGH.\n\nI will be going back to Brisbane next year to live for a while as ive had it with New Zealand. Its the arsehole of the 'civilized' world.\n\nI hate kiwis with a passion. And I hate New Zealand. Brisbane is a shit hole too but at least i have mates and people i can RELATE to over there, and theres always something to do, and i can have a laugh, and eat decent food.\n\nI strongly advise anyone thinking of coming here to think twice, you will regret it.\n\nI'm sure ill get lots of replies from kiwis getting all defensive about new zealand. But theres nothing to defend. NZ is a shithole, and 'scenery' just doesnt cut it after a while.\n\nThe usual responses i get from kiwi dullards are 'harden the **** up' or '**** off back to Brisbane\". \n\nSo, if you want to come to New Zealand, and end up as a miserable, depressed as **** individual, lose money you put into this dump, and be on the verge of losing your sanity, by all means, come to new zealand.\n\nI've travelled all over new zealand, lived in wellington and auckland, then christchurch. Its all shite.\n\nBefore i came here, i was a happy go lucky guy, full of life etc. THis country has sucked my soul dry.\n\nIts a dead end country full of simpletons. I can not wait to get back to Inala and Hamilton, maybe even the shitty West End halfway houses, and kiss the ground. I will never take it for granted again.\n\nBut the aliens might stop me because its the Happening and the planet is going to melt when the moon rises.\n","author_flair_text":"Le Chiko Rolle Connosur","subreddit_id":"t5_39p1u","link_flair_css_class":null,"edited":false,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"over_18":false,"author":"MaMasWeeWees","media":null,"stickied":false,"ups":0,"score":0,"saved":false,"created_utc":1451612798,"id":"3yz5q1","name":"t3_3yz5q1","link_flair_text":null,"from":null,"downs":0,"subreddit":"BneStrong","num_comments":3,"title":"A Brisbanite's thoughts on the Wonderful Country of New Zealand"}

Anyway, I don't know if this matters 28f, still living at home, asian, work full time (very good job with benefits), not in school - want to go back/never graduated college.\n\nThis might be long so please bear with me.\n\nSLEEP: I don't sleep well - I never have. Even as a child my mom said I never slept. I have done sleep labs and they said I don't have sleep apnea. I wake up feeling like my head is heavy like pins and needs. I've gotten sleep aids from doctors like trazadone and a few others but they don't help. I just wake up feeling like I have hangovers. I've tried melatonin, valerian root and tyleno PM but all sleep aids make me restless and I want to jump all over the place. My doctor and I've tried many things including changing the dosages. I feel like it's messing with my memory and remembering things are important to me. \n\nALCOHOL AND DRUG USE: rarely drink and never do drugs. I just get bored. \n\nTherapy: I went to therapy years ago, after my ex treated me very poorly. Also, for family issues. My therapist didn't think that I have depression and I switched and again they only say I have a mild case? I've ever tried to kill myself a few times. They put me on a few antidepressants - I literally felt high all the time and forgetful and I was still very angry. I really didn't want meds to define me. My DR slowly had me taper off antidepressants because I was showing a lot of improvement. I also feel like I have ADHD, it is so difficult for me to concentrate and remember what people say, my drs have said I don't display any symptoms of ADHD because I don't talk all the time or say random shit i guess.I kind of resent it because I feel like it didn't help/work for me - is this the case for anyone? Or is it my fault? It probably is on me because it has to do with my mindset? they did say I have SAD - I think this could be true - I get off work at 8PM so it's dark out during winter, I don't want to do anything but when spring or summer rolls around my spirits are high. therapy was expensive even with insurance.\n\nPARENTS: I am not very close with my parents. As a child they were separated. I lived with my dad and my brother. He loved my brother more. They played a lot. I was kind of the boring child and my dad used to yell at me for getting sick all the time as a child. I saw my mom on weekends or she'd pick me up for my dance classes (she worked 4 jobs to let me keep doing my activities) and then drive for an hour so I could train with the best. It wasn't until I was 12 I developed an eating disorder - I never had treatment because nobody noticed - well quite simply My weight change was not noticeable. My parents and my extended family always called me fat and compared me to my cousin who has an amazing figure but that is common in Chinese families I guess. The women only care about their looks but they also didn't make any sense because they'd say shit like \"it doesn't matter what you look like, what matters is your intelligence.......why are you so fat and ugly.\" My dad treated my mom poorly. Or they treated each other poorly. They yelled all the time - in front of us. It never affected my brother. I saw my mom go through crazy mood swings and i think she has schizophrenia because my crazy aunt (whom I hate very much but I still talk to because she is my aunt - but it is a very distant relationship) kept telling my mom how there are cameras in the house. My mom turned off all lights and unplugged everything all the time. My dad smoked 3 packs a day and I never picked up smoking thank god. I was just so angry all the time that i started to gain a lot of weight in middle school. I got picked on in middle school by the asian students because I mostly hung out with white students.  My relationship with them got better in high school, my mom moved back in and my parents ended up buying a house instead of living in that nasty dump. Once again my parents fought all the time, it was only the time during my senior year in high school I started to resent my parents. They fought so much that one day my dad left - he was suppose to pick me up from school so I walked home 10 miles, found a bottle of alcohol and drank the whole thing (first time drinking) and almost drowned myself in the bathtub  - i dont remember any of this and my brother didn't know I was drunk. i felt alone - I woke up to my mom - in a caring voice \"are people at school picking on you\" but I didn't answer her because I didn't care and I was so angry. Why do I resent my parents? I feel like I should be grateful for them....I cry when I think about them passing away, I feel like this will be the hardest thing for me when they do. I also resent my brother because he threw away all of my stuff - textbooks, clothing, etc. He still lives at home but I don't talk to him. I rarely see my parents because I work and they work too, odd hours and by the time I get home they are asleep. My family is not affectionate, the only person I ever hug is my cousin. she's about as close to a best friend....but we have been very distant since growing up and only seeing each other twice a year.\n\nForward to college: I only went to community college. I never graduated. I could barely find a job or keep a job because I got bored. I wasn't really ready. I found a better job and moved out. Things were going better but I moved back home to take care of my mom. I get sad when I think about my parents, I used to think they were invincible. \n\nOTHER/RANDOM:  I stress out a lot, I feel like time is not on my side, i feel like I want to learn so much. Everything I want to learn costs money. I get low energy after work, I used to enjoy things like outdoor activities and everybody says I am high energy but then when I get left alone I don't want to do anything. Sometimes I get freaked out because I am 28 and still not married and a fence sitting about having kids or not (I don't want to be a wishy washy person with kids and I never want to get a divorce) but at the same time I really don't care that Im not married/have kids. I don't feel creative anymore - i used to write music and draw. When the colder weather rolls around my relationships tend to end and guys break up with me. I find it difficult to make friends and I don't go to bars and I go to meetups some times but I still don't care. I had anxiety as a child I guess - like my thoughts would be so different/more mature than most kids in elementary school and I remember my 2nd grade teacher staying that to my dad at the conference and I know I did not make it up. And in 8th grade my teacher called my mom and aunt to come in and started telling them that he thinks I am depressed and they just shot back him \"she's only in 8th grade. she doesn't know what depression is.\"\n\nI feel like my health is changing. I don't go to the bathroom regularly yeah TMI. \n\nDATING: I dated someone for 2 years and I had dated someone else before him (who was great and I keep in contact with the ex before him). He was great a first but after a while he got really fit. I mean I wasn't in the greatest shape but I had years of dance and gymnastics experience. He got really upset at me when I could lift more than him and I hate really crappy (in his opinion), I got berated, he would make jokes but would just say \"i'm just being sarcastic, he had me buy him alcohol and drugs, he said he wasn't addicted but he lied to me many times. We broke up and he told people about how gross my body was to his friends. I went to therapy after him. I dated again after a while, it takes me a long time to trust people (people say they are patient but they really aren't) and sometimes when people do some things like my ex I start to compare. I'm tired of getting hurt and lied to by people I date. it's difficult for me to be sexual that i feel like I'm turning asexual. I'm never attracted to anyone physically.\n\nI am 28 now, I found a better job with consistent hours but now I am bored, it's an amazing job with amazing benefits, pay and coworkers. I get stressed out if I have a job with random hours/days. I feel like I am something more, like I could be traveling instead of doing this. I don't have a lot of skills, and I am not very social as I am still shy/awkward but lots of people don't think I am, I stop talking as soon as attractive people show up or when people say my personality is annoying (I still have a lot of insecurities).\n\nTLDR; I still don't know who I am at age 28 , want to go back to school but I am scared I will fail my classes like before and don't want to be in debt, still live at home because I want to save money to buy my own house soon, therapy is expensive and I don't know how to afford it + prescriptions. I feel like my whole life is a city and colour album. lots of things hold me back to do bigger things because i dont know how to go about them. Why do I resent my parents when in reality they did so much for me? I can't sleep, I am still insecure and shy, I love my job but I feel like I could be doing so much more, I have crappy dating relationships.\nI think that's most of it.

I then rang to find out that my Grandma who had lived across the road my entire live had died suddenly with no reason in the night. I only realize now that really she was basically a second mum and that that's it, she's gone, no goodbye.\n\nThen 2 days after that funeral, my great aunt dies, so I have another funeral to go to. \n\nThe worst part about this is more the fact that my Granddad who has dementia doesn't remember, so he has rung the police on a number of occasions because he thinks she is missing and the most upsetting part is I can't even imagine what it's like to have to be told on a daily/hourly basis that your wife died weeks ago and you can't remember it. He never ever cried as long as I can remember, her funeral was the first time I have ever seen a tear in his eyes so I know that it hurt him a lot they were married 65 years. My mum is basically constantly caring for him now and that makes me feel guilty because I cannot really help because I couldn't even imagine how to tell him that she's dead, I don't even thing I could say it if I tried.\n\nI am in my final year of uni, I am barely looking at a pass because of hating it and also family situation has been slowly getting worse (uncle has parkinsons, granddad has dementia, cousin has degenerative eye disease) over the past few years and on top if it now my mum is looking after my granddad I would rather be at home so I don't want to go back this January.\n\nI don't know what I want to do for a job, I thought I did but uni has made me hate the subject I'm studying and on top of that my auntie is determined I must get a good job and she keeps asking what I want to do and it does more to annoy me more than anything because it makes me feel like I really am fucked if I am supposed to get some fantastic job when I know my degree is already fucked.\n\nSo yeah, debt, hate my degree, shit family happenings and forced anticipation of a job.

We've been close friends for 2 years on and off (not because of fights, but because of life. The closeness always comes and goes). But anyway, we've always get close again, basically. She's written me from jail, confided in me, we've hung out one-on-one multiple times.  So we're definitely more than just casual acquaintances. \n\nAnyways, it's been over a month since the last time we've hung out one-on-one. It's also been quite a few weeks since I've seen her. Recently, she's been falling off of text conversations really quickly, like I feel like I'm just a random dude she met in a bar as of right now. What will happen is that she'll reply to my initial text (usually asking her what's up), and she'll even ask me how/what I'm doing, but when I follow up, she just doesn't reply. So she at least says something, most people who aren't interested at all don't say jack shit.\n\nOur last conversation (yesterday) went like this: \n\nMe: Hey, what's up?    \nHer: Not much trying to get ready for tomorrow running errands. How are you? What are you up to? \nMe: Yeah, I'm doing good. I've been super busy with work. And not much, hanging out with a buddy. I feel like I haven't talked to you in a minute, so I was wondering if everything was good. Btw, got any plans for NYE?    \n*No reply*\n\nI feel like my message was a little awkward. As I said in the text to her, I was hanging out with a buddy. So me and him had a few beers, so texting, for me, when I have had one drink tends to get a little iffy. \n\nI feel like the message might have been cringe-worthy. I was like \"I haven't talked to you in a long time\" and \"Btw, got any plans for NYE?\" AFTER she said she was \"getting ready for tomorrow\", thus saying she had plans. So that was a stupid message. &gt;.&lt;\n\nI feel like it was a good sign, because she asked how I was AND what I was up to. However, she kinda fell off again like she did the last one.\n\nKeep in mind, I'm not blowing her up. The last time I tried to reach out was 2 weeks ago. I always try to space out the conversations so it won't come across as needy. \n\nI really want to figure out if I did anything wrong. It is really troubling because we've been friends for a while, and have been close and shared a lot of bonding moments. We've been out of state together, I wrote her while she was in jail, etc. But we haven't hung out since September. And she keeps on falling off text conversations recently. The last time she initiated a conversation was 2-3 weeks ago, and that was because she was looking for weed.\n\n**TL;DR** Friend acting weird. I'm worried I did something wrong.

Long story short: I discovered alcohol during my freshman year in college (I'm 22 now) and pretty quickly went from a social drinker to a heavy social drinker and finally to an anti-social, solo drinker.  \n\nI'm kind of a weird drinker: I drank as a sort of on/off switch. During my last two years I worked/studied when I was sober, and relaxed when I was drunk.  At first I relaxed by socializing in a big social circle - which I gradually recoiled from when my drinking got heavier.  \n\nIn large part, alcohol actually helped me be successful - I was always *on* when sober, and *off* only when drunk.  I woke up at the same time every day (6:10am) and worked through whatever hangover I had until my first drink (around ~5pm).  I graduated from undergrad and went straight into my dream PhD program on scholarship while consulting on the side.  \n\nBut I knew I had a problem.  I decided to stop drinking when I moved to my new school - and I did, but I feel so much worse than I did when I was drinking.\n\nAgain, trying to keep this short: \n\nI'm in a new city, I don't know anyone and I don't know how to meet people without alcohol.  Alcohol - when I first started drinking - blunted my self-awareness and bolstered my self-esteem just enough for me to talk to people and feel comfortable relaxing.  At the expense of sounding like a cynical asshole: I feel horribly corny and fake when I socialize sober.\n\nI don't know how to relax when I'm sober and relaxing feels more anxious and stressful than working. I spend more time in the lab making work for myself than I do in my apartment.  It's miserable and I don't know how to fix it - it's the first problem I've ever had that I can't work or drink myself out of.\n\nTo be honest I feel like I was better off when I was drinking.  I knew I was lonely, I knew I was recoiling from my friends, I knew that I was working too much and couldn't turn my anxiety off, but at least I had a handle waiting for me in the freezer.  I miss the feeling of walking through my door, pouring myself a shot, and dancing around my apartment.

I am 17 years old and live with my parents, obviously, but the events only happen to me. My parents have not been affected with the experiences that i have had to see, and i think it terrifies me even more to know that i am the one being targeted. It has been explicitly shown to me throughout these events that it only wants me, and i have no idea how to stop it. I will begin explaining from the beginning now. \n\nAbout a month ago, I read a story here on /r/nosleep from a user named daniellesleeps. The [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3tx6nu/they_are_disappearing/) was short and terrifying in my opinion, which made it more enjoyable for me. I posted a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3tx6nu/they_are_disappearing/cxakqqi) on it about a month ago on an account to which i forgot its password for, so i created this account. After I posted the comment, 3 days later, I heard banging on my window.  I didn't think much of it since my parents usually do this to get my attention since i'm always holed up in my room, but when i opened the curtain, no one was there, just a small little 'V' written on the window, as if someone breathed directly onto the window and wrote on it. Nothing happened after that. \n\nThings started to get weird 3 days ago. I mean, really weird. I woke up at around 1pm 3 days ago and felt a sharp pain across my back. I mean, *sharp*. I put it off for a little while since i've been having lower-back problems anyways, but this is something i felt sting my whole back, so i decided to check. \n\n[this is what was on my back](http://imgur.com/bYpAopH) \nI apologize if you can't see it well, but i could see it very clearly, and it says \"VON\". huh? Von? \n\nDesperate for some answers, I went to the only logical place to get them. Google. I searched and searched and searched. I typed in the definition of \"von\" if there was one, and all i got were something about German surnames. I'm lost. Not to mention I have no clue why i have a fucking huge scratch mark on my back that says \"VON\". I asked my family if this was some weird prank pulled on me, and they looked horrified. My little brother started to cry, i dont know why. I quickly decided this isn't their doing when I realized im a very very very light sleeper. the slightest sound will wake me up, let alone huge fucking scratch marks on my back. \n\nConfused, I left it alone. I was scared to sleep in my room, so I slept with my older brother. I thought, if something were to be in my room, perhaps it wouldn't find me if it wasn't there.\n\nwrong. \n\n[I woke up to this the next day](http://imgur.com/uT3hpsH)\n\nThats a fucking *carving on my skin* that says \"VON\". who the fuck.... HOW the fuck... Its red around the edges and pulsating like a bitch and i didn't feel it at night. I was scared out of my mind. Hell, I still am. I have no idea how this is in relation to the story i read a month ago, but it seems off. I know it has something to do with it. \n\nMy parents advised me to go to the police or something, but I dont know what I would tell them. I don't think they would have much to go on from there anyways. They agreed. \n\nscared and horrified, I went to my room to try and get some clothes to take to my parents room because there was no way in hell I was going to sleep in my room anymore, and i found [this](http://imgur.com/a/Y67Z1)\n\nThat little memo pad was given to me when I was about 8 years old from my mom and i hardly ever used it. It's stashed away in a box inside my closet and haven't it opened it up since we moved to the U.S. 5 years ago. \n\nIt look weird and unbelievable, i know, trust me. I thought this was some badly made up prank from my older brother but he's the one whose been helping me through this, along with my family. \n\nThe words say: \"Allt sem graer hefur von\". Finally, something I can work with. I work my way to Google Translate. \n\nIcelandic. \"All that heals has hope.\" Some North Germanic language spoken in Iceland. Huh? Im confused. Im lost. And most of all, Im scared. What does that mean? Who is breaking into my home and coming into my room to write some cheesey One Direction one-liners on my memo-pad and carving them onto my body? \n\nI then realized that \"von\" was written in the paper, underlined. Von. Google translate: \"hope\". What the hell.... \n\nI'm scared reddit. I don't know whats happening. It's only gotten worse. I feel overwhelmed when I walk inside my room and need to quickly get out before I start to freak out. \n\nIt hasn't gotten better. Last night, It's where it all went downhill. It was the last straw for me. It started when I went into my room and didn't feel overwhelmed for the first time. I decided to do my make-up since I was about to go out with my friends. When I finished, I decided to take a picture of myself. It's a really stupid picture (I'm a fan of making stupid faces for the sake of laughing at myself) but it's the picture that made me **run for my life**\n\n[this is the picture that I cannot explain](http://imgur.com/CagkbNA)\n\nWhat. The. Fuck. Is. That. \n\nI know it all seems stupid and made-up but believe me, no one was there with me in my room. I do not know anyone who looks like that and all i want is for this to stop. \n\nAfter I took the picture I ran. I didn't even bother looking back to check if she was there, I bolted out of there and ran for my friends house. I called my mom and told her what happened and she has allowed me to stay here for a while until this all clears up. \n\nAs of right now, I'm at my friends house writing this, since I feel like /r/nosleep would be a better help than the police. \n\n... I just got an email.... I'm scared to open it. The subject of the email is already enough for me to fear for my life. \n\n[the email is the first one you see, above the one about the sex offenders in my area](http://imgur.com/RJeblml)\n\n[This is the picture sent to me within the email](http://imgur.com/ZajJ5vO)\n\nThat picture was taken after I have left my house. That is the woman that appeared in the picture I took of myself. I never have my room light on. That is not me on that bed. Who changed the position of my bed??? Who took that picture? why are they there? what do they want?\n\nI told my family to get out of there. I called them and they are on their way to a hotel. \n\nPlease help me out guys. I'm begging you to tell me anything you find within these picture or what the correlation between \"Von\" and the story i read has.... I am terrified and I dont want to harm my family. PM me with anything you can find. I will try to update on this post if I find anything. Thank you. \n\n.........\n\n**Update 1/1/2016**\n\nThank you all for your messages for me to stay safe. As for the people that do not believe me, I do not expect you to. I did not post this story for the sake of popularity, but to get help after seeing what this community does for the people who do not have answers to their own experiences. It can't be helped, but from now on I will only answer to people who are willing to help me with my situation. Anyways..\n\nMy parents are safely staying with family and I am getting ready to go with them. They have also called the police, filing a report about an intruder in my home (they left out the part where they think it was a demon or something like that). They arrived today at around 8am (its 12pm already) and they said that my room has not been changed. Everything is in it normal place, as opposed to the picture sent to me within the email. \n\nHowever, they did find signs of forced entry. Where? edges of my window. However, I quickly dismissed that with being me trying to sneak out of my house a couple times, and that on one time, i bent the screen door on the window. So i guess it was back to square one. \n\nI forgot to mention earlier that we have a little house shed behind my house. I dont know if the person has been living there, but i doubt it, since that little shed is a room my mom regularly visits. The police are still investigating and told us to stay clear for a little bit, telling us that if we are away for at least a week, they might move on and leave. \n\nOne significant update, however, is that I will be going to take a drug test soon. a user [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3yzhjn/something_or_someone_has_been_leaving_me_notes/cyi32zi) that it could be a possibility and my parents have agreed to be precautions and get tested. I think sometimes this week will be the test. \n\nNot much of an update but i thought you guys should know. Don't know if anything else will happen after this but my hopes are that it doesn't and I can live on. Thank you all for your comments and good wishes.

{"domain":"self.LittlespacePersonals","selftext":"I'm gonna start off by saying that I am polyamorous and I'm looking to supplement, not replace, my current relationships. I have an amazing but relatively vanilla boyfriend, and I'm hoping to find someone that this stuff comes a little more easily to. I need to find someone who will click both with me and with him. Not saying you need to have a relationship with him, but it's super important to be that you two can at least be friends.\n\nAlso, I'm located in Delaware. I'd like to find someone who can visit me at least once or twice a month. \n\nI'm twenty, but I'll be twenty-one end of February. I'm slightly nerdy and a PC gamer (go League of Legends). I have a dark sense of humor and I'm also a HUGE fan of puns and dad jokes. I love reading (Kevin Hearne, Stephen King, Piers Anthony, and John Green are my favorites), sitcoms, and movies of pretty much any kind if they're not too gory. There's a special place in my heart for anything involving Alice in Wonderland. I'm very stubborn and my mouth has gotten me into trouble on more than one occasion. I'm very affectionate and needy. I'm 5'6\", relatively skinny, and I'm irritated with how large my breasts are. I identify as genderqueer, but I'm mostly and biologically female. I like to explain it as if gender is a scale from one being female and five being male, I hover between 1.5 and 3 depending on my mood. I have a cat who is a total piece of shit, but he's the light of my life and I talk about him too much. \n\nKink-wise, I'm very into pet play, bondage, masochism, humiliation/degradation, and fear play. I'm also sexually attracted to knives, so that's a thing. My biggest limits are anything related to bodily fluids (more on that later) and hypnosis. I need to take most things very slowly, so if you like diving in headfirst then I'm not your gal. Little-wise, my age is somewhere between two and eight so I usually split the difference and say that I'm five. I love cartoons, sippies, pacis, pull-ups, coloring, glitter, and stickers. I don't do little-speak (typing like dis), but I definitely have a baby-er voice aloud when I'm little. I'm still not sure if I'm a sexual little. \n\nNow for the not-fun stuff: I have bipolar type II, social anxiety, PTSD, and ED-NOS. Other than the PTSD, most of those are under control with medication. The PTSD stems from an abusive relationship as well as from growing up in an abusive household. Body fluids and other messy things cause a lot of anxiety for me. I can be self-destructive, and sometimes I get so tangled up in the past that I can't function well in the present. I try not to be ashamed of all of this which is why I'm laying it out on the table right now. If you're reading this and decide to message me, make sure to mention your favorite color so I know you read at least most of this post.\n\nWhat I'm looking for: I'm hoping to find someone who can give me a lot of attention, like near-constant messaging for several hours most days kind of attention. Communication is super important to me, and I need to feel like I can trust you. If you can play League and/or Hearthstone and maybe some other games with me, I'd love that. I need you to be firm and to say no when it's necessary, but don't squash my brattiness completely. I need you to be patient with me, even when I'm being difficult because of depression or anxiety. I'd really like to find someone who will appreciate my romantic gestures such as being like \"this song makes me think of you\" etc. and who will do things like that back. I tend to prefer people older than me. I want someone who will read to me and maybe even color with me. I'm looking more for a nurturer than a strict Dom. \n\nDeal-breakers:\n\n* over 30\n\n* having me be \"the other woman\" (i.e. you have a relationship that I will be a secret from)\n\n* misogyny, racism, homophobia, transphobia, Donald Trump supporter, etc.\n\n* monogamy\n\n* one-twue-way BDSM philosophy\n\n* active military (I can explain once I fully trust you)\n\nRandom things:\n\n* I view \"Princess\" like a title. I don't really like being called it right away\n\n* I'm still not so sure how I feel about calling people \"Daddy\" or \"Mommy\" but I think I could warm up to it\n\n* I have trouble understanding people sometimes, so don't be surprised if I ask you to rephrase things. You probably made sense, but my brain is weird about processing both verbal and written information at times. \n\n* I really like learning new things! So if you like teaching then we'll be a good match!\n\n* Sometimes I give too much information because I'm scared about not giving enough\n\nI like to talk on kik, so if you think we might get along or whathaveyou shoot me a message with your username :3","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_353xf","link_flair_css_class":"F","edited":false,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"author":"feistylilkitten","over_18":true,"media":null,"stickied":false,"ups":0,"saved":false,"created_utc":1451621762,"score":0,"id":"3yzj4f","name":"t3_3yzj4f","from":null,"link_flair_text":"Female Poster","downs":0,"subreddit":"LittlespacePersonals","num_comments":0,"title":"[20 F4R] Delaware (localish) Poly little looking for Big","media_embed":{},"locked":false,"distinguished":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LittlespacePersonals/comments/3yzj4f/20_f4r_delaware_localish_poly_little_looking_for/","secure_media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"permalink":"/r/LittlespacePersonals/comments/3yzj4f/20_f4r_delaware_localish_poly_little_looking_for/","gilded":0,"quarantine":false,"thumbnail":"nsfw","from_kind":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1454965499,"is_self":true,"secure_media":null}

Recently, in the past year, she has been wanting to lose weight. She's at a healthy weight. It's just that she's very into fashion and makeup and thus is constantly bombarded by images of 'skinny' and 'fit' girls, especially on instagram. \n\nThough she wants to lose weight, she's not very knowledgable about the whole process (which is understandable, as a lot of people aren't). She follows a whole bunch of 'detox' and 'weight loss secret' accounts and basically started taking their advice. She started drinking lemon water/green tea, eating overnight oats, sweet potatoes, etc. Every time she attempts to make a healthy meal, she'll make something that she hates but is supposed to be 'good for her' (i.e. roasted sweet potato, salad).

Since then, it's happened several more times, occasionally accompanied by a feeling of shortness of breath. Whenever it happens, I check my pulse and nothing seems wrong (occasionally the pulse line looks a bit odd on my phone, but that could easily be an issue caused by my hand moving or something) and I never actually have any trouble drawing in breath.  Over the last few days, this has been recurring periodically, along with an occasional feeling of tightness in my throat and one or two bouts of transient weakness.\n\nAs background, I had two spontaneous pneumothoraxes in my left lung a little over a decade ago, the second of which was treated with a chest tube and eventually a pluerodesis. I think I had some minor nerve damage as a result of the surgery; at the very least, the entire left side of my chest was left numb for several months. Other than that and a broken right clavicle, I've never had any major health issues.
