In addition, every other day (like today) I have to get on a bus to go to a different school for my IT class. Well, this girl also goes to this school when I do (not a coincidence, she is smart and wants to go to this school for good education in whatever class she takes there.) I also have my first period with her on this day. Also, she is extremely attractive and sophisticated.\n\nSo, in my first period today, we took a test and then  my teacher wanted to talk about managing stress. Me and this kid at my table (we will call him Austin) like to joke around with our teacher, so we were making silly jokes. I notice this girl (same one who I mentioned above) is laughing at our jokes. She also sits at mine and Austin's table. \n\nFast forward to the bus. I get on and I *always* sit near the front, hooligans love to sit in the back. Well, I see this girl is sitting in the only semi-empty seat in the front. I sit next to her and ask if I may sit here. She says yes and I sit down, as I am taking my backpack off half way (when the bus starts driving I sit it down) a kid gets hooked to my strap and starts pulling me as he forces his way out. I basically look like a goof, being pulled nearly off of my seat.\n\nOne more thing about me, I am socially awkward, and I have a hard time talking to girls. I don't have a thing for this girl, but I am really embarrassed and start mumbling (yes, I'm sure the \"doctors of reddit\" will diagnose me with autism)\n\nWell, after that embarrassing.moment, she looks at me and says \"were you in first period today?\" I said yeah, and she replies \"oh, I was distracted by Austin.\"\n\nThe thought that Austin and I were making similar stupid jokes and she only noticed him is kinda hurtful.

His record was 113-17 coming into the game, with a 1923 rating. It was easy to find him on overall standings, since he's 5th all time on PS3. I'm 32-11 (~5 of those losses via pre-patch glitches).  \n\nI was like damn, quite the record, and then when I saw his not so great lineup and his SP was Volquez. I was thinking something may be fishy. Anyways, this guy seems to be from Puerto Rico and his team is called the Carolina Prospects, and the base running/fielding animations was as bad as it always is when playing someone against Puerto Rico, or he was just a master of the lag switch. On one occasion I hit a single to RF with Cuddy on first base, and Cuddy didn't even run for second base, so that was odd. And commentary was saying the opposite of what actually happened half of the time.\n\nAnyways, on to the cheating he pulled. I was beating him 2-1 and I had a complete game 2 hitter with Julio Teheran. The last pitch of the game to finish him off was a curveball line out to my RF, and at the *precise* moment he caught it my system became frozen. I kept my PS3 on for 30 minutes, even though it was completely unresponsive (no PS menu access). I booted it back up after waiting for the system error scan to finish, fully expecting to somehow have a loss, but there is no account of the game in my game history! (Yet?) \n\nHow is it, that from his end, he's able to make the game and my system unresponsive so that I have to do a hard restart, all while avoiding the loss? I like how he waited until the game was over to do whatever he did.\n\nI hit two homers off of Volquez going into the 3rd inning, and he pulled him early, then he diced me up with his relievers for the rest of the game, constant ground outs and line outs. His only run was on a Sandoval 2 seam fb homer. This player must cheat often, his avg is .233 with a *bad* .371 slugging %. And 2.66 era. \n\nNo way he is anywhere close to legit with that low of slugging %, not many good base stealers, and bad plate discipline. .257 obp.\n\nAnyone on this subreddit face him before? I'm sure someone has, I'm guessing he's played a boatload more games than the 130 he has if he's able to void games like this. I'm sure filing a grief report will do nothing, why is the studio against banning him?\n\nOn a side note, I think it's funny that the best player on PS3 is far and away better than this guy, and he switched his team name to \"Done with DD for a while.\"\n\n-------\n\nTL;DR: Very bad 5th place ranked player on PS3 pulled some real bullshit to void the 1 run, 2 hit complete game I spun against him.

I still have problems speaking in front of a class, I tend to stutter. I am also afraid of almost everything. I think of the worst possible outcome. My stress is always through the roof. I have had psychotic episodes and I am getting increasingly afraid I will oneday lose control of my self. \nMy family has always taken pictures of events. There are thousands of family pictures and believe over the year i have looked through them countless times, I have never seen the guy resemebling who did it to me. Which for a time made me think to myself that it NEVER happened and that i was lying to myself, that i couldn't tell the difference between reality and fantasy. But i came to the conclusion that it was indeed real, I wasn't having any of these symptoms when i was that young, and being that young i had no concept of rape, sex, sexual abuse/molestation or anything so I wouldn't make it up. Its weird, I have to convince myself that myself isn't lying\nAnyhow enough of this story, Thank you to all who read. I just made a Reddit and will try to be active in this group I know what you are going through. I spent a week in a mental hospital when i was 18, and since then I have had the diagnosis of ptsd and I am on heavy medication.\nUpdate: I will probably never go to the police, because they probably couldn't do anything and I am ashamed to talk about it, especially describing it. I can barely write it out on a keyboard. I also doubt they would believe me, given how some rape victims are treated.\nI am a guy by the way","id":"34gqdz","archived":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_34gqdz","gilded":0,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":21,"is_self":true,"author":"thatcraylonewanderer","from":null,"stickied":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/34gqdz/i_am_20_years_old_and_a_survivor_of_childhood/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qm0x","created":1430443871,"from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"score":17,"edited":1430440536}

{"media":null,"selftext":"(If you don't want to read all this you can get the gist of it by reading the last 2 paragraphs and the bolded bit in paragraph 3).\n\nI moved around a lot when I was younger so I got used to having to integrate into new school and neighbourhood social circles and attain a close group of friends etc... It came easy to me and I never seemed to have trouble. From 15 onwards I was in the same school and this is when I grew a lot, from average height to one of the tallest.\n\nNow I'm 21 I've noticed these last couple years it has been a lot harder to meet new people compared to others around me. I still have good friends from before and my problem would even present itself a lot there. We'll go out some place and meet another group. All my friends seem to instantly get along with the new group but I'd feel myself not finding it as seamless as I used to. For the next few days I'd feel slightly depressed. I felt like people didn't want to know me and they disliked me for no reason without even knowing me. It started to take its toll.\n\nA couple of months ago I started really thinking about it and analysing past situations in my head trying to see where I'm going wrong. I've come to the conclusion that my height is the cause. Since then I become consciously aware of it when meeting new people and it's cleared up all the problems. **I've accepted that I have to make 100% of the initial effort when meeting new people whereas for my friends (and me when I was average height as I sprouted at around 16) it's more like 50/50 effort.**\n\nI have plenty of examples of how my social life is a lot healthier now. I typed up one about a work colleagues wedding I went to last week but it turned into a wall of text very quickly so I left it out. The tl;dr: would have previously been shit time but instead I met a bunch of new people, including one girl who I've since been texting and meeting up with next weekend.\n\nTyped up another about how my social situation in the gym has changed from being an outcast of the 'early morning gang' for 6+ months to now being good friends with all of them within a week after I realised the issue. Again, that became a wall of text. I don't want people to skip the thread because I'm interested if you guys experience the same problems.\n\nI now play tennis regularly with one of the gym guys. One time when we were playing I asked \"How come we never spoke for all those months\" to which he replied, word for word, \"I don't know, you seemed like you didn't want people to talk to you ... it's probably cause you're big\".\n\nThe funny thing is on the /r/tall spectrum I'm not even tall, so I feel a bit silly typing this as if I'm some 10 foot giant but it's confirmed itself to me a number of times now. Anyone else here feel the same way or do I just have the kind of friendly face that'd give [Ice Cube](http://i.imgur.com/6abSLrX.jpg) a run for his money?","retrieved_on":1440761735,"ups":7,"permalink":"/r/tall/comments/34gqx5/people_not_initiating_socially_anyone_experience/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","title":"People not initiating socially - anyone experience this?","preview":{"images":[{"id":"OGRsa2qbqspDOAxMZ9xPT-n1FhrvAdF06WGkUu-_tM4","variants":{},"source":{"height":500,"width":500,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/d4xw-hm56E8C0UprrIsjKsclfBZicYIZigUn21TQR8U.jpg?s=4029f0bbf11e3260a0358c9103e7e52c"},"resolutions":[{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/d4xw-hm56E8C0UprrIsjKsclfBZicYIZigUn21TQR8U.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=fb23ba3dac846c7c329d1a1a81bf7e68","height":108,"width":108},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/d4xw-hm56E8C0UprrIsjKsclfBZicYIZigUn21TQR8U.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=47ba794fc8a61b0bc76ff6c3ea30d301","height":216,"width":216},{"height":320,"width":320,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/d4xw-hm56E8C0UprrIsjKsclfBZicYIZigUn21TQR8U.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=6f07d31d27b51312279d873209ee9708"}]}]},"secure_media_embed":{},"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"tall","created_utc":"1430440554","author_flair_text":"6'4\" | 194 cm","domain":"self.tall","hide_score":false,"quarantine":false,"score":7,"edited":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/tall/comments/34gqx5/people_not_initiating_socially_anyone_experience/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qv8g","from_kind":null,"created":1430444154,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"author":"Goodbreak","from":null,"post_hint":"self","is_self":true,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":"blue","num_comments":10,"id":"34gqx5","archived":false,"name":"t3_34gqx5","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null}

No cleavage. Nothing too tight. No boys ever in touching range. Curfew, rules, codes for as long as he could. Screaming at me for everything I did, for every little deviation from his ideal line. Home was hell, and he knew it, and he didn't care.\n\nAnd yet, I know he loved me. Not as a father tends to love a daughter, but as a rich man loves his jewels. Greedily.\n\nWell, now I'm 18, and things are getting harder for him to control. Threats have been flying up and down since he discovered I'd gone out for coffee with a male friend. If only he knew what else I've been doing behind his back.\n\nBut last month the last straw was put on when he became physically aggressive. It had happened before, but this will be the last time.

My kinks, from which we'll probably have to make a nice selection, include training, sluttification, slutty outfits and wardrobe control, petplay (kitty/pony/puppy), orientation play, cum play, watersports, objectification, humiliation, gangbangs, bondage, BDSM gear, some body mod, breeding/preg, and the list goes on. I'm not going to set any limits for this one, and you really can't scare me away, so if you want to go nuts, by all means go nuts.\n\n(EDIT: Just to clear things up - this is not about fucking me once to ruin my eyeliner.

At the time, I was quite interested and didn't have a problem signing up. They *only* offered contracts for their program in year long lengths. I had said I might only want to take lessons for 4 or 5 months, and they verbally told me that was fine and I could cancel at any time. I asked if there was any fee for canceling and was told multiple times not to worry about it and that canceling was no problem. I felt pretty uneasy about this, but being and idiot and believing I'd want to be there for a year I signed anyways.\n\nFast forward 6 months and I've discovered that they are actually a pretty terrible and devious organization, especially when it comes to the treatment of their employees.\n\nThe only line in the contract about cancellation reads \"This agreement is subject to cancellation at any time during the term of the agreement upon notification by the student. If this agreement is cancelled with three business days, the studio will refund all payments made under the agreement. After three business days, the studio will only charge you for the dance instructions and dance instruction services actually furnished under the agreement plus a reasonable and fair service fee.\"\n\nThey wouldn't answer it for me at signing, but I suppose it needs to be answered now: What the heck is reasonable and fair? If I were to continue for the remainder of the year, there would be about $3000 to pay for the rest of my lessons. I have a feeling they'll probably attempt to charge me as much as possible, so I'd like to go in knowing legally what they can actually charge me so I don't spend more than I have to.\n\nThanks so much!\n\ntl;dr: I don't like the organization I'm taking private lessons from and want out.

My light blue room was illuminated by the moonlight at an angle that would ricochet off of the top of my wooden dresser and would hit part of my door and the white walls of my hallway would glow acting as a natural night light.  For this reason my bedroom door was typically open.  Every once in a while a man, who stood tall, taller than my father who is roughly 6 feet, would pace the hallway very peacefully and walked with strong, yet graceful strides.  His image was a new experience and odd to me because, as cliche as this may sound, the color was not full, rather quite faded, but I could still tell he has red curly hair that was not yet long enough to fall.  All he would ever say to me is that he is here to protect me and my family and at that age I accepted this and would go back to sleep.  The thing I found very odd I remember is the way he spoke, or more appropriately, communicated with me.  His mouth would be moving, yet there was no sound, rather I could hear him in my head.  So eventually I asked my mom who is the man in the hallway who watches us at night? The look on her face is imprinted into my memory and it resembles an \"oh shit not him too\" type expression, but proceeded to tell me he is a friend and is here to protect us.  Recently I asked my mom about this man because the memory of this time had popped into my head.  Apparently the last night before we moved to our new house he woke my mother and spoke to her saying we are safe now and he will be here if we ever needed him. \n\nMy second experience I was slightly older, but same house and same room.  I would hear this odd type of communicating and would wake up.  We lived very close to the highways and a busy road and I remembered car lights passing through the windows like a ocean side bedroom overlooking a lighthouse.  I walked towards the windows and grabbed the flimsy white strings to retract the white plastic blinds with multiple missing pieces due to mine and my brothers destructive games.  These experiences were always brief, as I would just look out the window and at the top of the best sledding hill in the town was a person just standing outside of the perimeter of the overgrown grass to the fired road, which lead around 100 yards to the highway.  Oddly enough, this spirit was dressed in a pirate costume.  You could easily tell it was a costume because of the sheer corniness.  \n\nThe following experience was over a large time period and occurred at my parents current property, but different house.  My step-dad inherited from his grandfather this absolutely majestic piece of property of an acre and half, lake side in a more secluded are of the lake.  Well before my mother and stepdad, Pat, married he lived in his grandfather's house, which was a very homey.  In the basement is where we kept the floats, right next to his grandfather's workbench where a pull string light hung over it from the wood structure above.  This basement was incredibly erie and who ever lost rock, paper, scissors had the unfortunate task of sprinting down there, turning on the light by almost yanking the string out of the lightbulb, grabbing all the rafts, turning off the light once again and running out.  From the lake you could see in the basement of the old house and EVERY time all of us would be out on the lake the pull string light would turn back on.  My mother, the brave one, would walk back up the hill, go down into the basement and turn it off (because shes so cheap lol).  There was no one else in the area because this house is pretty secluded and we could easily see anyone walking into the basement.\n\nAround the age of 9 my brother and I were sleeping in my step-uncle's bed in the old lake house for the first time.  It was so hot and sticky I only had a sheet laying over me, which would stick to my sweaty body, nonetheless I eventually managed to fall asleep.  I woke up to the strange communication and I looked up to see a man standing 3 feet from the bed curiously looking down on my brother and I wearing a faded suit and tie. He was very slender and had wrinkles on his face like a photo of one of the old farmers.  At this age I understood what was happening and petrified I screamed and yanked the thin sheet over my head as the man repeatedly asked who we were.  I tried grabbing my old brother, shaking, poking anything for him to help me.  He happily turned, told me to shut the fuck up and kicked me off the bed RIGHT AT THIS MANS FEET!  Now my brother isnt as...gifted...as my mother and I and cannot see spirits.  Well, I looked up at this man who towered over me as I laid on the floor and quickly juked him into the hallway and took the short stride to my stepdad's room where him and my mom were sleeping.  Frantically I woke my mom up and she quickly assessed the situation in my high moment of stress telling me to relax and that she will take care of it.  As I took her spot in bed and threw the covers over my head I tried to listen over the pounding of my heart that I could feel through my neck and into my ears.  She spoke normally and described to this man who we were in about two minutes and returned.  Keep in mind, I never told her he was asking me who we were.  The next morning my stepdad showed me a picture of a man and without hesitation it was him, who turns out to be my stepdad's grandfather.\n\nAt this point I'm quickly becoming tired and if people commenting would like to hear the rest of my stories and my mom's, who her experiences put mine to shame, I will post and edit or followup post tomorrow.  Goodnight all, I hope you find your way this far and enjoy the stories. \n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdate:\n\nOkay so it seems this post is getting some decent attention so I'll finish my stories, talk about my theory and share some of my mother's.  \n\n\nThe last one I saw under the age of 10 was at my Aunt Kathy's in North Carolina.  We took a trip down to see her with my mother and brother.  It was late, hot and I was sweating profusely, which caused me to wake up with the awful dry feeling in my mouth.  I got out of the spare bedroom bed and walked down the hallway towards the dining room, which was bright because the moon filled the room from the glass slider and floor to floor windows that overlooked the river she lives on.  The dining room consists of a massively long old wooden table that must be around 15 feet and chair lined perfectly along the sides with a slightly larger chair at the head of the table.  There she was.  Dreaded nappy hair, loose fitting clothes, boots kicked up on the old wooden table and she was silently holding a guitar as she slowly looked up at me.  Her face was clear, no wrinkles and very innocent looking women probably in her thirties.  So naturally I screamed and ran into my mom's room and woke her up.  I explained to her who is out there and all I wanted was a glass of water and how terrified I am.  She walked me back to my room told me to relax and I can hear her speaking but couldn't quite make out what she was saying.  Shortly after she came back with a glass of water, telling me she left and to go to bed.\n\nMy mother and I were dropping my friend off at his house, which is located right next to the giant flag pole at the center of my town and is lined with old houses, town halls etc.  We pulled in to his driveway, he got out and waved at the door to let us know he was okay.  My mom turned me to and asked how many did you see?  I told her 5, she say 6.  In all of the windows, spirits appeared as we rolled into the drive, subtly moving the curtains and peaking like a child from behind a mother legs while some just blatantly stood in the window and just looked us at.  We backed out and drove home.\n\nThe previous story  was my last time seeing spirits as I can recall around the age of 12, and this one was shortly before, but I wanted to share it last because of it's uniqueness.  My family was in church and had a very young, charismatic and very friendly priest who was the only one who could capture my attention during these sermons.  This particular Sunday morning he had a very strange white glow following his whole body and figured it had to be some strange lighting effect.  Curious about it I asked my brother who looked up, said I was stupid because nothing is there then told me to stop bothering him as he sneakily was trying to become a pokemon master during church.  I got my moms attention and she said she found it strange too because she also saw it.  During the week the priest unexpectedly passed away.\n\n**\nNow my theory as to why I believe I don't see spirits currently.  Around the age of 12-13 I really began to start questioning religion for various reason that I won't get into.  Around the same time before bed I would close my eyes and whisper to myself to not bother me, please don't bother me, I don't want to see any spirits etc.  And ever since then I cannot see them.  I don't know which one caused it or if it's combination of the two.  My mom tells me that I'm not open to it anymore and I block them so that's why I can't currently.  So I guess her logic supports the later, but I have a strong feeling for some reason religion has to be involved in some way.  Well, please let me know your thoughts on these theories.\n\n**\nNow for my mother's stories.  These are all from my recollection of her telling me, but I believe I have a great memory when it comes to these stories.\n\nSome background on my mother.  She is a feisty little one who works in the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) for the past 30 years and doesn't take shit from anyone.  With that said she is extremely religious, a philanthropist (donates 10% minimum of her income yearly because I guess the Bible says to?) and extremely loving.  Just an all around great mother.  So while working in the MICU she says she constantly sees her patients spirits walking out of the hospital, walking the down the hall to leave the unit, leaving with their family etc. after they pass away.  There is not one story that sticks out to her because it is such a norm for her.\n\nFor her it started around the same age in my grandparents house.  She use to have a little dog that slept with her and one night started parking at her closed bedroom door.  Curious she got up, opened it and saw a little girl at the end of the hallway standing there looking at her.  The dog chased the girl, who ran and disappeared into her sisters room.  After she chased her, she was gone.  Whenever I was in my grandparents old house I HATED the top floor where this happened.  I always had a feeling of someone else's presence, and although I never saw anyone, I just knew something was there.\n\nWhile she was in college to become a nurse, she went to a school that was at the time converting recently purchased old mansions in the area to dormitories.  When her and her friends were coming back from a party, they drunkenly snuck into one of the construction sites that was in the early stage of construction.  Her and a few friends stood at the porch of this massive house and my mom being the brave one was the first to enter.  Instantly her mannerisms, posture, walk, tone of voice changed.  She proceeded to give a tour of the house to her friends recalling information she previously could not have known about the house, who lived in it etc.  As they left the front door she asked her friends if they were ready to go in. \n\nAt this point you can probably tell my mom has fine tuned this ability and sometimes she likes to have some fun with it.  My stepdad and her were on a haunted tour in one of the famous haunted towns.  They hungout in the back and my mom, who has never been in this particular state, city, tour etc before, would give my stepdad a brief overview of what happened in the house before the tour guide would stop the group and talk.  She would explain how this women has 8 kids, and an abusive husband who pushed her down the stairs and broke her neck (not the actually story of a house there, but you catch my drift). Eventually people in the tour heard my mother and were absolutely astonished at this.  At the end they had her up in the front with the tour guide and my mom would say what happened as the tour guide's jaw dropped and just added more details to the story.  The tour ended at \"The Captains Graveyard\" (this may give the location away to a few) and when she tried stepping in she couldn't.  She felt a hand pushing her back at the entrance and proceeded to creep a few more out who decided not to enter.  My stepdad said it was wild once you went in because the winds got stronger and just more hectic the closer you got to the captain's grave.\n\nIn the old lake house where I saw my stepdad's grandfather, she convinced me, my brother, and two stepsisters to close all the doors and sit in the hallway where I saw him.  We got towels and covered the undercuts of all the doors.  The hallway was very short and had four entranceways, all with doors and all which were closed and blocked with towels.  Two doors were to the bedrooms, one to the living room and one to stairs up to the attic door. As we sat there Indian style on the floor in silence my mother closed her eyes as all my siblings tried looking at each other in the dark, petrified.  Cold air just appeared from no where, no wind since everything was blocked off.  We freaked and ran out of there all trying to fit through the same door at the same time.\n\nBefore I was born my grandmother passed away in her sleep.  After the funeral the family was at the house and my mom walked up the stairs to the only bathroom.  My grandmother, her mother in law, was standing in the doorway of her small sewing room and asked my mother to come in and talk.  She proceeded to tell her how she passed away peacefully and to tell everyone she loves them and goodbye. \n\n9 months ago my my grandfather passed away, my mom's father, who too was extremely religious.  Really badass, but very religious.  Shortly after this my stepdad's mother passed away.  At the funeral of my step grandmother, at the same church were we saw the strange glow around the priest, my mother saw my grandfather.  He was casually sitting behind the priest in one of the seats just watching.  No communication, but just sat and watched the whole sermon.  We believe he came to bring my stepdad's mother to heaven.\n\nI hope everyone enjoys the stories.

Today I came to the realization that I need to change every aspect of my training.  I've only been carrying/shooting consistently for a few years now.  I've taken steps to train my right hand to manipulate keys, cell phone, ect, by itself.  I have even started carrying said items on my right side.  However, progress with consistently getting on paper has been a slow uphill battle.  I would say I'm a 70% on target shooter from 10 yards, at best (we're talking 8\" targets at 10 yards).  **Until today!**  Out of pure frustration I picked up my PPS with my right hand and gave it a whirl.  Besides feeling natural, my field of vision felt so much more open.  After the initial tight grouping at 10 yards I moved to the  4 inch target.  6 out of 7 on paper.  By the end of my range day (with my right hand) I was putting up 1/4\"-1/2\" groupings, on the 4\" target, at 20 and 30 yards consistently.  I was a little less consistent with my Glock 27, but still far superior than previous performances.\n\nMy concern now, will I be able to train my right side to become my strong side?  Manipulation of my PPS was not terrible, but problematic.  Racking the slide, while not physically difficult, was a safety hazard.  I kept catching myself angling the gun to the side and not down range when getting ready to chamber.  With my Glock, I can't operate the mag release at all.  My thumb just isn't capable.  This may be because the gun is just to wide for my hand.  I never thought it a problem seeing as I used my middle finger for releasing on my left hand.  When it comes to holsters, I've already decided to start carrying at the 1 o'clock.  I have been experimenting with appendix carry and was about to move that direction anyways.  I feel it will be easier to train drawing from a more forward position with my weak hand.\n\nAfter all is said and done, I'm looking forward to learning this new way of life.  I feel somewhat vindicated, like my *Man Card* was given back to me.  I'm not a terrible shot, I'm just not a left handed shooter.  Even more exciting, the Sig P938 which I can now rationalize buying.  Ya know, for manual dexterity training.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for letting me share my thoughts and experience.

Because, in coincidence, my life was always similar to the story. I am a kid in high school, and whenever I like a girl, a group of kids do EVERYTHING they can to ruin it, from simply insulting me to STICKING A SHARP POLE IN MY BODY, a lot like the league of 7 evil exes. Now, one kid, for example, named Taylor, is very similar, by coinidence, to Gideon. Not only is he the \"leader\" of this group, he is also a huge douche! Not to mention he wears glasses and has a very similar fashion sense to Mr. Graves as well as being popular, the one \"who's blowing up right now\", and taking theatre, like, you know, the Chaos Theatre. Now, all the Evil Exes reminded me of one of these people, like the Katayagi Twins, the \"Handsom Jerk\" and \"Perfect Asshat\", are very similar to the twins at my school, who are huge pricks, and attractive, see where I am going with this? Well, I imagine you can assume what kind of people the other four remind me of. Now, myself? Me, myself, is similar to Scott Pilgrim. Not \"amazing\" at anything, kinda rude at times, LOVES videogames, and such and such. And heck, my best friend who is gay, just like Wallace. Out of complete COINCIDENCE, this story meant so much to me, and I mean, A LOT. And yes, it gave me new-found confidence, and I actually went and beat the EVER LIVING fuck out of those people. Obviously, they didn't turn into coins and stuff (it would so awesome if they did), but none of the less, I took my life back, because of Bryan Lee O'Malley's work. Now I am 16, and nobody messes with me, except the occasional bad-eyes from those soulless shells.  Violence isn't the answer, they say, but what if the pain becomes unbareable, what if the adults don't help, what if they won't stop? That's what I said, and clearly, what I did, saved me, and my future. This is why Scott Pilgrim means so much to me.\n\nLet's just say, Scott Pilgrim changed my life more than anyone may think.\ufeff","retrieved_on":1440761629,"ups":2,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"ScottPilgrim","created_utc":"1430444944","author_flair_text":"","domain":"self.ScottPilgrim","hide_score":false,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","title":"My \"Story\" as a Scott Pilgrim fan","secure_media_embed":{}}

It's not that I'm not smart, it is simply because I am not interested in going to college. Why? Well, I have no idea what to do with my life in the future.\n\nI'm now searching for a job in my area because my old one is ending. Long story short, the owner has to travel to another country to see family members, and since the place I work at has very little workers (small community), that wouldn't hold so well.\n\nI got the $1K from my parents, probably because they want me to do something with it. They expect too much from me. Don't think I'm some rich kid or whatever, this hasn't happened before. I've only been 18 for 2 months now, so all the expectations are coming or going to come to me.\n\nRight now, like I said, I have no idea what I'm going to do with my future. I would really like to become a livestreamer (basically online TV host except instead of football or sports its video games and instead of a host I'm playing the game itself) or a pro gamer. Lots of people say you'll never get there, or its just really hard to get there. I give 0 fucks. I'm doing it because there is nothing else that I'm interested in (and therefore not going to do later in life e.g. becoming a doctor).\n\nWith that out of the way, here's what I want to do with the money. I've no experience in investing, saving, etc. My parents never taught me anything about it (yeah, I don't know why they would give me $1000, probably because I don't have a job anymore...for now).\n\n- Buy a better computer to run games on (which is why I explained about the gaming situation, I have a Macbook which doesn't run games very well)\n\n- Save money as best as possible. I'll most likely find a job soon, so making money won't be much of a problem, I hope\n\nCurrently, I'm living in my parents' house. I'm still in high school as a senior and do not need to worry about housing or tax issues."}

He of course could not be happier to pop my cherry and we set the date for last night. I go over there and we head straight to the bedroom. I ask him if he has a laptop that we can watch some porn on and he pulls his out (his laptop, not his cock. thats in a second). I put on some of my favorite younger-older porn and he starts undressing me. He knew this was my first time so he took command and just guided me. Once, hes undressed me, he gets up and takes his own clothes off. When his big belly flopped out of his shirt, I think I might have moaned. I take his pants down and his cock is basically the same size as mine, 6 inches and cut. I take him slowly just loving every second. \n\nAfter a while of that, he gets me up, sets me on all fours on his bed so I can view his laptop, and then starts rimming me like crazy. Before long he was fingering me too, getting my hole loosened. I hadn't had something in my ass for a while and I could barely contain myself. Finally, he stopped and went to his nightstand,  pulling out a condom and lube. He lays down on his bed and starts putting the condom. He tells me to straddle him and then he gets a bunch of lube on his hand and starts working it into my hole. I'm jerking myself while he continues to lube up my ass, when he asks me if I'm ready. I nervously say yes and his cock brushes my hole. Wow. It feels like electricity is serging through my body. He starts pushing in with his head and I can feel it going in. The head hurt my hole a bit, and I thought I was going to ask him to stop once the head was in, but to my surprise, after the head went in his whole shaft basically slid in. I almost came right there. For the first few minutes I slowly bobbed up and down a little bit on his shaft, still getting used to this incredible but strange sensation. Once I relaxed, my hole relaxed too and i was bouncing up and down on his cock, in total ecstasy.\n\nI rode him for a bit longer and then he said he wanted to change positions. I couldnt have cared less what position we were in, as long as his cock was still in me. He pushed me on to my back with my ass hanging off the edge of his bed and he stood up. Him being the one to control the tempo now, he started off slow, seeing how I would respond. I started wanting more and so started grinding my body into him and he got the clue. He really picked up his pace and I was at his mercy. The pleasure I was in is indescribeable. I think that was his favorite position because that is what we stayed in for the rest of the night. After what seemed like hours of pure pleasurable fucking, he told me was about to cum. The way he said it, and just the grunting and puffing he was doing was sending me over the edge. He got louder and louder and when he thrusted all the way and stayed there while letting out an orgasmic cry, I of course knew he had just started shooting his load in me. I could feel the condom filling up with his cum and that made me shoot my load all over my self and his bed. \n\nWe just stay still for a minute, just panting, with his dick still in my ass, and me covered in my own cum. Once he pulls out, he starts collecting my cum on his hand and then has me lick my cum off his hand. We got up and showered each other off (we were also drenched in sweat). I left pretty much after that, and I've been on cloud 9 since last night. \n\n","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/TopsAndBottoms/comments/34h1cg/first_time_bottoming_nsfw/","title":"First time bottoming!

My name is Olivia. Today I was just released from a psychiatric hospital for the 6th time in the past 5 years. I tried to jump in front of a moving car which is different from my normal go-to of overdose or slitting my wrists.\n\nI live in a household with my verbally/mentally-abusing mother and my younger sister who acts the exact same. Recently, my older, drug addicted and abusive brother moved in with us as well.\n\nBeing the middle child, I'm always picked on but it's to a much stronger degree in my household. I'm told that I'm worthless, a piece of shit, that I should die and other things of that nature. So, you can imagine why I've tried to kill myself more than 10 times. \n\nIn addition to all of that, I go to counseling, but it's not enough. I would like to try medication, but my mother won't allow it for some reason. Even while I'm in the hospital she will tell the staff not to give me any medication besides PRN (as needed medication) to help with my anxiety, insomnia or general pain (like Tylenol). \n\nThe point of me making this post is because I need help moving out. I live in St. Louis, Missouri and I do attend a private high school. My mother doesn't pay for it though; my school pays for my tuition and school supplies. I also have a job that I work regularly that isn't too far from my school.\n\nMy wish is to emancipate my mother so that I can get the medical help that I need. Some people tell me to wait another year, but I might have killed myself by that time due to the fact that I *haven't* gotten help. In order to emancipate, I need a stable source of income (check), to be enrolled in school (check), and have a place to live. That's where I need help.\n\nIt would mean the world to me if I could find a place to stay in the St. Louis area where it's not difficult for me to get to and from school and work. I don't drive yet, but I'm willing to give gas money, pay rent, buy groceries, and whatever else I need to do to earn my keep in the household.\n\nI'm not a troublesome child. I'm normally very calm, quiet and collect. I don't eat much either. It'll be like I'm not even there...\n\nSo, if there's any possibility of anyone helping me, it would mean the world. Or if you know anyone who lives in St. Louis and is willing to help me, it would be very appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading this.\n~ Olivia","retrieved_on":1440761599,"ups":28,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Assistance","created_utc":"1430446214","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.Assistance","hide_score":false,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","title":"I'm 17 years old and I need assistance...","secure_media_embed":{}}

Biking is my main transportation and I've been exercising at home, I'm going to read the guide later but first I just wanted to run this by you guys and see if I'm doing anything blatantly wrong.\n\nI'm 25 y/o guy. I'm 6'2 and weigh about 185-190lb but by no means fat. I'm lanky and thin. I exercise to get a bit stronger, feel better, and be able to sleep at a decent time.\n\nI play music and keep track of time that way.\nEX: ok I started when the guitar came in, ended when the vocalist said \"now\", *rewinds song to those points* ok looks like that was 2 mins.\nI also mark my results in excel and I've been serious about keeping to this since January this year.\n\nI start my daily(semi daily, working on it) exercise with jumping jacks. At the peak of jumping jacks my heart rate is at around 200, which is after an average of 2 mins, which I would guess is around 120 jumping jacks. Also my legs/feet hurt and won't let me do more at that time. I tried doing more today but I just got dizzy.\n\nThen I do 10 reps of 3 sets of normal pushups with about 1-3 min water break in-between. At least, I try to. I haven't quite gotten there yet. The pushups I can't complete, I complete on my knees (which still feels hard after the real ones). Today it was 10x7(13 on knees), but a few weeks ago I hit 10x10x9(1) and I haven't been back there since. Today I just collapsed during the 2nd set and literally couldn't pick myself up.\n\nThen I do planks, and I just can't pass 50 secs, been stuck there for a few weeks.\n\nLittered in-between randomly I do bicep curls with water jugs that probably weigh a little less than 15lb a piece. It's heavier than milk. I don't keep track of these I just do em till it's tiring.\n\nAfter that I eat 2 hard-boiled eggs for protein, and I usually eat something with chicken and broccoli later, for dinner. Oatmeal for breakfast.\n\nI also carry about 40lb-50lbs of groceries a mile uphill once or twice a week, but that's not a part of a workout that I can track.\n\nAnyway, I've improved a lot since January, when I could only do a maximum of 5 pushups, but planking seems to have only improved by at best 10 seconds since I started.\n\nIt still seems like I should be further by now, or am I on the right track? \n\nThanks","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1440761588,"num_comments":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_34h2b5","id":"34h2b5","archived":false,"from":null,"author":"Sleeper256","is_self":true,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/34h2b5/it_seems_like_im_failing_more_than_increasing/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhx4","created":1430450241,"stickied":false,"score":0,"edited":false,"quarantine":false}

I have a few pictures of what I typically look like [here](http://imgur.com/a/FxNQ8).  This is my daily wear. Typically I wear a black shirt, jeans, a belt (this is a belt that tightens as you tug on it like a tie-down), white socks, and my shoes. I'm going to list out things that I think I need help on.\n\n- I have one pair of shoes because I don't see what the point in others are, but I know that it can't look good to be in the same shoes for over a year.  At that point if I were to get new shoes for some variety, I don't know what I'd want to get. \n\n- I have a variety of black shirts, and I think it works well on me.  I have a few basic pattern shirts like the one shown in the album, I have some graphic tees that promote bands and podcasts I like, and I have some plain tees that are just grey or ruffled black and whatnot. I like them, but I know that it can get boring with one color/theme\n\n- I wear jeans that fit I'm pretty sure. It's hard to find ones that fit when I'm 6'3 but they look alright to me.  My biggest worry is my belt.  I have a belt that tugs tighter, a  standard black belt, and a pokemon belt that I cycle through whenever I feel like it. \n\n- I own a watch that looks fairly nice and I wear it regularly, I have a buddha necklace that I wear at all times, and I have a ring that I wear occasionally.  I feel like that's a bit much for jewlery, but I want to know if anything, what change there should be in that.\n\n- I have a beanie that I've owned for four years that's very loose fitting and I feel looks nice on me. I just got a haircut so I haven't worn it lately but I'm still wondering if it's good for the look I'm trying to achieve.\n\n- Lastly my hair.  I have hair that is half-way between an afro and wavy, so it likes to poof up and is stubborn like an afro, but it's not neat like an afro. So it compiles itself into something messy as often as it can (Mostly why I wear a beanie when I have longer hair).  \n\nI'm hoping that you guys can give me some wise words as to how I can improve my style, thank you in advance! :)"}

At a young age they thought I had ADD and ADHD like every other kid in the world I blame fast food and junk we eat. So I used to take ADD pills and stuff. For years as a kid and stopped at a young and still lived a fun healthy life. No problems. Never once did I have anxiety or panic attacks or any mental problems. But in high school around 16-17 years old I started smoking weed with friends every time it was fine and just got hungry and giggly. I have always been focused and did good in school and was pretty happy. One time smoking, it was a weird experience, I remember seeing my hands and life around me in really slow motion and then I have the scariest panic attack you could imagine. I was in tunnel vision and was experiencing deja vu times 1000. I would walk in circles for a few minutes which felt like a life time. I swore on every thing I was dead and was in hell and I would never escape. I could hear and feel my heart out side my body loud. I couldn't breath. But the tunnel vision and feeling dead was the scariest thing ever. I started running and felt better but when I stopped it hit me again. I should have went to the er. But ended up going back to my friends and they had smoked the same thing but nothing happened to them. they were just high not in a different world like me. They mad me pretty much lay down and go to sleep. I woke up 6-8 hours later still feeling different. Just not the same. Like I was still high or just off. And I went home and took a shower and went back to bed for another 10 hours.  I just lived my life as I could the next few weeks and I started feeling back to my normal self. But then one day in school I got a horrible panic attack and had to go home it was a flash back of that night at my buddies and not as bad no but just scary. My buddies just thought maybe get high again and it will chill me out. so about a month of not being high I tried it again and it was different kind and all but bam it hit me again and I went to tunnel vision deja vu world again for another 8 hours and felt weird for another week. after that just about everyday in school I would have anxiety and panic attacks. I went to the dr and all my signs checked out fine but they put me on I think Zoloft I took 1 pill and had a horrible panic attack and then tried again the next day. Even worse so pills made me freak out and I stopped taking them. I basically laid in bed for many months after that and school every day was a nightmare. I almost dropped out. After years of just dealing with it I tried really cheap weed that was supposed to be for anxiety and I just started to have another horrible experience. All my relationships have ruined cause I get really panicy and so much anxiety and really weird. It has been 5-6 years since I smoked for the last time. and by no means was I ever a stoner. I used to drink for fun and life wasn't so bad. just a little different. To this day if I sip on a beer I get panic attacks and like a flash back of the bad experience. I haven't had a panic attack in years but recently had to start taking antibiotics and lost my appetite, it was for a week and lost about 10 pounds, I am 5'11 and was always around 140 and now a lot lower. The last 5 years or so I just feel different, its hard to explain cause I look and seem and act normal for the most part but have a weird ocd thing about me. I have to eat all organic and non gmo food and organics. And only reversed osmoses water. I don't eat fast food or soda and been like this for a while but I feel I will feel worst if I eat bad and I developed a food phobia. any food I don't make or see mad I think its laced and I will start to freak out and get all panic attacky, this is daily, even with food I buy and make I can still get all weird about it. In the last week of antibiotics my life has gone back down hill. a lot of panic attacks and feeling really spacey and out of it. I have the biggest fear of losing my memory and I get panic attacks a lot from it. theres no signs in my family just scares me. so I eat really healthy maybe not as much as I should but still its healthy. and I exercise.  My mom had surgery and is fine now my dad just found out he has cancer.  I sell cars for a living and its stressful. and I never went to college. and Im in the process of buying a new house. and got out of a 6 year relationship about 2 years that I haven't ever fully got over. so theres a lot going on. but I don't feel depressed im not overwhelmed. I feel fine and good but just off. I feel maybe I have a chemical imbalance and its making me off. Im in great shape and feel good and have a lot of energy . The research ive done seems to be a Canidia build up, or low vitamin d, or low gaba. So I been taking Gaba, Vit D, Canida remover, no sugar, been healthy, I also take omega 3 fish oils, and I was at a natural health dr and got me on protandium and told me the other things to take. I just feel so different and not myself I have anxiety and panicy, everyone I know eats so bad and is lazy and smokes weed why do I feel like this. This anxiety freaks me out and I been having a hard time concentrating and remembering things (nothing major) and I get more anxiety. But as a daily thing I can handle my stress and I don't feel stressed or depressed. I miss my ex but life goes on and the worst thing is just when I eat and start thinking about my anxiety and why I feel weird. I been feeling anxious lately over little things. And I feel short of breath and start panicing that how I feel is going to make me lose my mind and go crazy and then I freak out more and more. I try to read panic and anxiety books but cant stay focused or remember what I read since I panic and talk to myself a lot. Lately just been feeling lost, scared and numb to things. and work is just not working for me and I cant figure out what to do or where to get help. I try to also meditate lately and listen to calm music and I surround my self with good people and I exercise. I think this job just isn't challenging me and my brain and want to go back to school but scared to get panic attacks. but I want to work my brain and learn and grow but I want to feel better. What are your thoughts. What can I do or should I do? I wish I could explain how I feel. I wish there was a way to take test to see if I have a chemical imbalance or what is wrong","retrieved_on":1440761576,"ups":1,"subreddit":"askpsychology","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1430447151","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.askpsychology","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"what is wrong with me?

Also if you live in Minneapolis/St. Paul they do not outright deny you simply because of age (in case that helps anyone here to know). \n\n* I'm 22, but I've known since childhood that I did not want kids. I changed quite a bit from young childhood to young adulthood and this never wavered for a moment. \n\n* Hormonal birth control DOES NOT work. Doctors have been switching brands of pills and depo an average of every 7 months because I get constant bleeding, headaches, crazy water retention, cramps, etc. Basically PMDD becomes constant. \ni was started on bc to help PMDD, but a week to 10 days of feeling like shit (and an improvement until I can go abroad and remove my ovaries for a true cure to all of this) beats constant \"PMDD\" that wrecked my life while I was on birth control. Without birth control my period is 3-4 days with 2 days a fairly normal amount and then very very light. \n\n* the extra weight of pregnancy would cause my moderate to severe joint pain to get even worse. My ligaments are already at least as loose as a pregnant woman's. Plus I take medication that I can't stop for 9 months and I don't want to cause birth defects if I did want a child. \n\n* I hate babies and the care needed. If I did want kids later I'd adopt an older child and skip that phase. Besides, that would do a lot more good in the world than producing another new person. That's *if* I changed my mind which is incredibly unlikely. \n\n*My seizures cause temporary paralysis in my arm for up to a minute or 2 plus weakness for a few hours. I drop whatever I'm holding. Don't really want that to be a baby or even a child. \n\n* Sometimes when the joint pain gets bad I have to go lie down and not move for a while. There's no cure or even anything that can help unless I want to get surgery on almost every ligament on my body and even that might not work. It's not really a realistic option anyway. How am I supposed to care for a child when that happens? \n\n* I am the demographic least likely to regret the decision. Regret is low (5-6%) among childless women, regardless of their age at sterilization.\n\nI thought it was best to focus on physical issues, since a doctor could claim I needed counseling instead of Essure. however I've been to many (usually for other reasons but this came up sometimes) and none of them have changed my opinions and \"issues\" with the idea of getting pregnant. It will always disgust me. But a doctor may just tell me I haven't found the \"right counselor\" and refuse me. \n\n\nSo what do you think? I know you don't know my situation but is there anything in general that would help further, and that I can include or not include depending on my specific situation? \n\n\nThanks!","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/childfree/comments/34h45r/finally_got_a_preop_for_essure_planned_parenthood/"}

I'm Gustavo I'm 20, two months from 21 and extremely confused. \n\nFor one, I identify as a gay male. While I had my struggle accepting my homosexuality which included a long period of denial and then claiming bisexuality until I accepted the fact that I did feel attracted to women at all. \n\nI had never in my life questioned my identity. If anything the topic became interesting because of recent media exposure of transgender individuals even though I've used tumblr for years. I watched Transparent and was extremely sympathetic of the experiences. I watched Laverne Cox on OITNB and was very proud of her. Suddenly, things went to a deeper level after Bruce Jenner rumors heated up. There's something about her story that truly captured my attention and I was googling news every day because I was so interested. All the while still identifying as a young man. Then came his interview. Something stuck, it's only been 5 days but my questioning of my gender identity has not subsided. \n\nAgain, I never questioned. I knew it was okay to be trans, but I never felt a need. Growing up I knew I wasn't like other boys because I was in touch with my feminine side and liked boys, but I never thought of myself as a girl. But now, well I don't know what I'm feeling.  \nI do know certain things:\nevery time the idea of being a woman and fully identifying as female makes me EXTREMELY ANXIOUS. I enter this state of panic. I get really cold, depressed, lose my appetite, get so lost into thought that I feel like I lose control of my own body. \nAsking myself these questions makes me really frightened and anxious and when I try to imagine myself being fully female I lost a sense of self. I don't feel like myself at all but I can't for some reason stop thinking about it and how naturally it can feel. \n\nI've always been comfortable with my femininity and love the idea of me as a boy breaking gender barriers because I deeply believe that gender is a social construct and that the society determines the gender and society is wholly controlled by collective human thinking so any day or at least any time period in the space time continuum there could be a society where gender isn't even a thing. Essentially, I almost don't believe in the necessity of gender. \n\nAs for my sex. I've always been insecure about my body hair because I just felt like boys look better hairless but recently I stopped shaving bc I hate it and I've grown to like it. I've always been proud of my penis size although insecure about the curvature of my penis and the circumcision scars (yeah =/) but not to the point where I wanted to get rid of it (if anything give it a makeover). I actually feel like I have a biological inclination for boobs which is a trait I DETEST.  Hate my huge nipples, hate feeling like I have man boobs. I would literally have a breast reduction surgery. As for the rest of my body, some parts are on the feminine side (mostly my hips I feel) but that's actually something I appreciate because I do enjoy the feeling of femininity in a male body.\n\nI made this post because mostly, I am absolutely tired of my anxiety. It's taking over me. The only time it goes away, curiously enough, is when I stop questioning my male gender and male sex. It's almost euphoric and it feels like going back to reality and to myself and I fear for the next wave of female-thoughts induced anxiety. \n\nI hate the idea of only male and only female. Deeply. I fear the thought of living life as a transsexual woman. I feel like the personal struggle would not be worth the identity. \n\nWhen I look at women I think \"yeah I probably get her and she probably gets me\" but I do not think \"yeah we're the same gender\" or \"yeah we're internally the same sex\". If anything I've totally started to doubt whether anyone is truly the gender they are displaying. When I look at men, although usually straight men I see no similarities between us except the gender we represent. Recently, I try to picture having sex with a man as a woman but heterosexual intercourse turns me off.\n\nAs for my attraction for men, it's evolved. Unless I know they're gay I feel horrible about myself because I know they won't look at me in a sexual way. I yearn for it. Maybe that's independent from gender identity, but it does drive me crazy that I can't catch the attention of a man by just being male or even myself (probably insecurities about how cute or beautiful I consider myself). But I have at times seen myself in a mirror, or taken a selfie and said \"yeah I'm pretty cute\"\n\nAs for expressing myself as a woman:\nnever found makeup appealing\nnever found lady's underwear appealing (wore my moms underwear once but never again)\nI tried on my moms bra yesterday and I liked the feeling of being hugged but my anxiety came roaring in so I felt uncomfortable\nactually have always wanted to wear loose flowly skirts. \nnail polish is ew for me\n\nI thought I was your average gay stereotype but my enduring questioning is driving me insane. I never even liked it when people alluded to me being female and I've been perfectly fine with male pronouns.\n\nAs for questions I've seen in various threads:\nI would be born again as a girl, if I knew I'd end up having the same human identity but mostly because I hate the struggle of not being naturally heteronormative. However, imagining going through my life as a girl also brings me anxiety and something does not click.\n\nIf I could press a button right now I wouldn't choose to be female because the thought of it does not bring me happiness nor comfort but I would like not feeling like an outcast on the male spectrum (on a heternormative point of view). Although I guess I'd feel like an outcast as a woman as well. \n\nYet I continue to ask myself what would make me happier. Is it just that I need a new gender expression outlet but I do not know how to approach it? If I am some sort of trans I am willing to accept it but I really can't land on one category. \n\nI want the anxiety gone. Out of everything I want the anxiety to not take over me. Also I want my sex drive back. It's totally weakened in the last couple of weeks and I really miss having euphoric sex with my boyfriend(vers top if that helps). \n\nI hope this wasn't all too much.

I don't want to be physically forced, but more so mentally manipulated into it by an aggressive cocky teen. I like RPs that have a good deal of build up, character development, and realism to them; I don't want to go straight into the sex... it gets boring, FAST. For this reason I prefer to talk on yahoo messenger or via email, they're good ways to keep the story going for longer periods of time (I've done some over the course of a couple months before)\n\nI usually prefer to play around my actual age, 22. I'm 5'4\", shoulder length kinda wavy dirty/dark blonde hair, bright blue eyes, 34D, girl next door/sporty girl mix (I ran in high school and played soccer). \n\nSo, possible role ideas. Our relationship could be many different things... Neighbors, /your/ babysitter, siblings, sibling's best friend/bully, and I'm open to many other ideas.\n\nNow, the interesting part... how you make me your personal slave... Overall, I'm looking for a setup that will awaken the deep desire inside me to submit to a man as he shows me he is the most important person in the world and needs to be obeyed (think Alpha male mentality) Here are some of my favorites, but if you have another idea, please don't hesitate to let me know.\n\n* My favorite idea is that the teen would be so cocky, controlling, and manipulative that it would slowly awaken a deep desire inside me to obey and he plays off that new found feeling. I'd like this to be a theme in any situation we play out, but it can also stand by itself.\n\n* Another option is we make some sort of bet that I end up losing. This starts the ball rolling towards my ultimate submission. But just because I lost a bet of some sorts doesn't mean I'll immediately drop to my knees and start blowing you... But it'll start pushing me in that direction. Maybe the loser has to be a servant for the winner; It starts with fetching drinks/food, then moves to massages, then more.\n\n* A third idea, and this is as \"unrealistic\" as I like to go, is that you somehow brainwash me to make me more receptive to your advances and to accept your superiority. Maybe a drug, hypnosis, or subliminal messages in music you're playing... It wouldn't instantly make me a mindless slave, but slowly make me feel more submissive and obedient.\n\nOne setup I /usually/ hate is blackmail... Yes, it is very realistic, but it leads to very little build up... Usually once the blackmail material is revealed it goes directly into \"ok, you're my sex slave, let's do it.\" I'm not saying it couldn't be done right under the correct circumstances (or added onto some other idea) but an exclusive blackmail setup doesn't peak my interests.\n\nOther kinks include impregnation, public play, humiliation, mild bondage, name calling, bimbofication, D/s... [here's a link to my full kink chart](http://i.imgur.com/wqXEfL7.png) My only real limits are blood and scat. \n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you for reading...

I want to tell you what helped me, but first I want to give you a little background on myself and my thoughts when I was younger.\n\nFrom the middle of 9th grade on up, I would have literally rathered jump in a volcano than read aloud or do a presentation in front of my class. My grades suffered horribly from lack of participation, and I always either skipped or faked sick when I had a presentation coming up. Not only that, but I even avoided going to the doctor for help because, surprise surprise, I had too much anxiety to face any potential ridicule or embarrassment from asking for help. (Ridiculous I know. Us with SA work in weird ways sometimes, lol!)\n\nAnyways, I'm sure many of you still in highschool feel the same way as I did when I was your age. Helpless and alone in the world, battling an invisible mental demon that terrifies you every single time you sit in class, as you wait to be called on. Of course, to those without SA, it seems so insignificant, but you know how horrible it can be. \n\nWell Reddit, I remember being like you. (Well, mostly. I didn't have any sort of support group like Reddit to help me out! Haha)\n\nI remember laying in bed night after night, terrified of going to school the following day, and I know how much it sucks, so I wanted to come here and hopefully help out a few of you.\n\nMedications like Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, (SSRIs, Anti Depressants) usually come with terrible side effects and they are horrendous to try and quit taking. Withdraws are terrible when quitting, they take months to \"kick in\" and the anxiety gets way worse before it gets better. I tried them personally, and I would never ever recommend them to anyone. \nAnti-anxiety medications like Xanax can be even worse. They are extremely addictive and they start losing effectiveness very quickly which means you need more, and more, and more to stay calm. \n\nHowever...\nWith a ton of research on the internet (Thanks Al Gore!) a few years ago I came across a little wonder-pill that helped me out immensely. The type of pill is called a beta-blocker. A beta blocker basically \"calms\" your Central Nervous System, reducing your blood pressure and slowing your heart rate. \n\nWhat does this mean for you? \nWell, no more red face. No more shaking hands. No more heart palpitations. No more shaking, or nervous faltering voice. No more sweating through your clothes. \nSounds pretty cool right? And it kicks in within 45 minutes. Perfect to take before a presentation.\n\nWhat a Beta-Blocker will NOT do, however, is calm your mental state. It doesn't work on the brain, so you are going to be able to be yourself. No anti anxiety that makes you s..l..o..w, no anti depressant to make you foggy. You're clear headed and yet display NO visible signs of nervousness. This means that IT WILL HELP YOU GET BETTER AT PUBLIC SPEAKING. \n\nAs you watch yourself succeed again and again (Without using drugs that impair your brain or the \"liquid courage\" that comes from alcohol) You will slowly train yourself into being more open and less nervous in groups.\n\nAlthough, I AM NOT A DOCTOR! I'm just a regular guy telling you what worked for him, so please make sure you speak to your own physician about getting a script to try them out. Talk about any pros or cons, I think you'll find them to be very safe compared to the alternatives. They are not scheduled or anything, so it should be a fairly simple trip to the doc. (Make SURE you don't take more than the recommended dose, since it slows your heart you would not have a happy ending if you were to take too many. Please be careful!)\n\nIf you want to read a little more about Beta Blockers and what kinds I used for SA, this article runs down a little more in depth than I did in this post: http://www.eliteenvy.com/beta-blockers-for-anxiety-and-social-phobia/\n\nAnyways, I wish you all the best, and I hope it helps you. I would have given anything to learn about them when I was in school. Thanks for reading /r/socialanxiety and I wish you the best of luck!","retrieved_on":1440761550,"ups":12,"permalink":"/r/socialanxiety/comments/34h5am/social_anxiety_relief_using_beta_blockers_what/","link_flair_text":null,"author":"Unbewitch","post_hint":"self","from":null,"is_self":true,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"num_comments":12,"author_flair_css_class":null,"id":"34h5am","archived":false,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_34h5am","link_flair_css_class":null,"quarantine":false,"score":12,"edited":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/34h5am/social_anxiety_relief_using_beta_blockers_what/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"created":1430451918,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r22n","from_id":null,"stickied":false}

{"ups":3,"retrieved_on":1440761533,"selftext":"Background:\n\nMy mom currently has two mortgages. One is for a house she is living in and the other is for a condo my sister and I are living in. She is looking to get out from underneath the condo. My sister is currently in school and pays nothing towards the house. I have a job and pay for utilities. She pays the mortgage and HOA fees. Her preference is for the condo to go to me. She is not looking for any equity out of it. I am 24 and make about $75,000/year before tax and can financially support taking over on the condo (I can provide budget if needed).\n\n\nCondo numbers:\n\nThe condo was purchased for $95,000. There is currently ~$85,000 left on the mortgage. As a conservative estimate the condo is worth $95/foot (1600 sqf) = ~$150,000. HOA fees are $180/month\n\nWhat we are thinking:\n\nHer ideal situation is to have me own the condo. We first thought that she could just sell the condo to me for what is left on the mortgage and have the equity applied as a down payment. It is an FHA loan and we later found out that they require at least a 3.5% down payment and it might not even be possible to sell it to me for that low. If we can get around any sort of down payment or up front fees, that would be ideal. If necessary, I do have money saved up for any potential down payment and/or closing fees.\n\nAfter discussing with some family friends and mortgage brokers, it looks like it may be possible to get around having to sell it to me. First, she will add me to the deed. After that, I will pay for all of the house related costs (mortgage, utilities, HOA fees) for about a year. Last, she can take herself off the deed and the mortgage will be assumed by me (triple checking this is possible)\n\nQuestions:\n\nHas anyone ever had any sort of experience with this type of thing?\nDoes the last bit about the deed make the most sense to do?\nAny other way of going about it with minimal costs/fees/taxes?\nAnything I did not mention that we should be taking a look at?\n\nThanks!\n\n","media":null,"link_flair_text":"Housing","permalink":"/r/personalfinance/comments/34h6k9/looking_for_information_on_acquiring_mothers_condo/","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Looking For Information on Acquiring Mother's Condo.","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.personalfinance","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1430449030","subreddit":"personalfinance","media_embed":{},"score":3,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created":1430452630,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/34h6k9/looking_for_information_on_acquiring_mothers_condo/","secure_media":null,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"Tubarina","link_flair_css_class":"Housing","gilded":0,"name":"t3_34h6k9","archived":false,"id":"34h6k9","num_comments":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false}

Two years ago I was talked into going hunting. I wanted to take my son, who was eager to go. I drew, my son did not. He was very disappointed. We hunted, I never got a shot, that was the end of that. Good times were still had.\n\nLast year, I did not draw, but I did get my son an over the counter Cow Elk tag via a youth hunt. He did not get a shot.\n\nHe's 18 now, and we both put in for the draw. I drew for  a Deer and a Bull Elk. My son drew for nothing. He was crushed. Hastily, I told him that if he picked one of the two hunts, I would let him be the \"triggerman\" for that hunt, and I would take the next hunt. I did this because I love him and I want him to be happy. I mean, after all, who is going to know?\n\nMy hunting friends, hunting friends have no problem with this whatsoever. They think I am being an unselfish Father.\n\nMy family however, OMG, I am ruining my son. I am teaching him to break the law. I am teaching him to lie. I am risking my job. I could face criminal charges. It's an abomination!\n\nHe's 18, not a child, and he already knows how to lie. I've already told him I would do this for him...but now I feel guilty.\n\nI would appreciate your opinion.\n\n**EDIT** Removed rambling for conciseness. \n\n**EDIT** I have contacted NM Game and Fish with a request for them to consider allowing transfer of tags to immediate family members. Apparently it is a state law and it would have to go through the state legislature. I guess it can't hurt to send a letter.

For those of you who care for details I'm 4'10 and about 105 lbs. The girl in this story who I'll now refer to as peppa was about 5'6 and at least 300lbs (from looking on my body gallery).\n\nAnyway to get on with the story. I'd known peppa since I was about 4 years old, we went through nursery, primary and high school together. She had always been bigger than everyone else, but it didn't seen to bother her at first. When we got to about 7 years old the other kids started to notice and tease her. Over the years the teasing turned to constant bullying and she became quite withdrawn and at times aggressive.\n\nWe were never close but I always tried to be nice to her as not very many people were. I figured she was probably very lonely and if I was her I would have liked some support.\n\nIn high school she became much heavier, she was constantly targeted for it. She almost always had some form of snack in her hand; crisps chocolates, biscuits. You name it  She complained to me a lot about her weight and how no matter what she tried she was still fat. I felt so bad for her, I'd struggled with weight and eating myself (though in a different way). I wanted to help but 14 year old me has no idea how to approach the problem or how to help.\n\nAt times I suggested cutting out fizzy drinks or chocolate, she would nod but nothing ever came if it. She invited me to her house for a sleepover one weekend, this was when I discovered the root of her problem. Her mother.\n\nJust the amount of food! Peppa had two sisters both of whom also obese, one was only 7. If you were in her house there was never a time when no snacks were around. There was no such thing as spoiling your dinner with snacks and it always seemed to be time for dessert.\n\nShe lives just a couple of streets from me, we're 20 now. She's still very overweight, now with diabeetes. It seems after high school she hasnt done anything with her life. I do wonder sometimes how life would have been for her had she grown up somewhere else. She was such a nice girl,  but everything seemed to be set up against her from the day she was born.","retrieved_on":1440761517,"ups":88,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":13,"archived":false,"id":"34h7t0","name":"t3_34h7t0","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"author":"[deleted]","from":null,"is_self":true,"subreddit_id":"t5_2vzax","from_kind":null,"created":1430453287,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/34h7t0/bullied_ham/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"score":88,"edited":1430449956}

Also, I had a leg injury that broke through my growth plate? Long story short, I'm staying short. Anyway, I appreciate all the help!
