I used to try and be a good role model and play with him on the rare day that we would go to their house, but the visits got more frequent and they started taking holidays with us, I have slowly grown to hate him, to the point that his voice infuriates me.\nThe other kid throws a fit and acts all moody when she doesn't get her way, like when she doesn't like any of the food on the restaurant menu, or doesn't get to buy the toy she wants.\n\nSorry about the little rant about the kids, they are part of the reason I hate holidays but I needed to get that off my chest too.\n\nYou see we always go on holiday during the time I have off from college (UK college) or school holidays back when I was in school. It is always the half term I have during Halloween or the summer holidays that I get taken away to America.\n\nIts usually Halloween for Florida and somewhere else in America for summer, despite the fact that I hate it there and explain that I don't like holidays my parents (usually my mum) always has the same response \"Well you like it when you get there.\" I don't. I want to stay home during my time off from college, I want to go camping with my friends and hang out with them and have fun. I don't want to go to Florida each Halloween with those annoying kids and over shadow them while they walk around a shopping mall and collect candy.\n\n I don't want to have a 5 day trip to America when its my half term, I want to stay in England and meet my friends, but everytime I get taken on holiday I'm restrained from doing so, I get invited to events like camping or a party and I have to turn it down because my mum and dad have a massive hard on for America. Party invites are a big thing for me because I rarely get invited to anything at all. My social life only consists of talking to people on Facebook and meeting my small bunch of friends (about 5 or 7) now and then, so if I get invited to anything I am really happy about it.\n\nThese party's or camping events usually happen during my time off college, rarely during the weekend, and I can't go to them because of family holidays and its depressing as fuck, looking on Facebook and seeing photos of my friends and other people having fun, I just want to stay in England.\n\n\nSorry if this post is terribly put together but I had to start and stop now and then, and sorry if I sounded a bit obnoxious but I really needed to rant about this.\n\n\n"}

Two people live together, and they pay equal amounts on living expenses. However, similar to the way the rich can easily afford everything they need and want, the husband in this scenario has things much easier than his wife. He can work two days and make what she makes in a month, and in the remaining 28 days he can do whatever he likes. His wife, much like the poor, has to work constantly to afford to pay for living expenses.\n\n2. The husband has no legal obligation to give his wife money. This couple signed a prenup, so this arrangement was agreed upon before hand. The wife is no more entitled to the husband's money than the poor of society are entitled to the money of the wealthy.\n\n3. From the wife's perspective, the husband has it easy. Similar to the poor's perception of the 1%, she resents the fact that she has to work an unrewarding job while her husband gets to do whatever he wants. At the same time, the husband earned his money - why should he have to pay the for his wife's living expenses?\n\nI'm wonder what you guys think about this. Is this a fair comparison, or are these situations nothing alike? Should the rich be required to help the poor? Should this woman's husband be required to help her?\n\nFor the lazy, here's the post I'm talking about:\n\n&gt;It's a long story, bear with me.\n\n&gt;We met when I was 24 and he was 35, he was divorced and I was still naive and still a virgin.

During the dot-com book he was an executive at various high-tech companies, and made a lot of money, a lot. All the while I was working as well. This is important because his family is very poor, while my family is doing ok, not members of the 1% but doing fine nonetheless. So, right before getting married, my family's layer and my father forced him to sign a prenuptial agreement, well we both signed it, and it it it stated that we are both responsible to contribute 1/2 of all the living expenses.\n\n&gt;We have a good life, a nice house fully paid for, a second vacation home fully paid for, cars, we take vacations etc... Now he has been officially unemployed since 2001, while I have been working my a** off.

He could go out and get a job, and be able to support both of us while I find my own way, after all I've been working my ass off for the past 10 years while he's been playing around; but when I approach the subject he points to the prenuptial agreement pointing the finger at me saying that it was my family's idea, not his; and he has been paying his share all along without asking anything.\n\n&gt;I really don't know what to do. A friend of mine is a paralegal and she told me that if I were to divorce him, that prenup won't hold any water and I could get 1/2 of everything that we have, houses, cars, including his bank accounts. But I do love him and I don't want to divorce him, not threaten divorce, or even an ultimatum. But my present work situation is getting the best of me, I am 41 and I need to do something more rewarding with my life, going to work every day is hard, and I find it no longer challenging.\n\n&gt;I think that it is just fair that since he has not worked in 10+ year, it is now my turn to play a little, don't you think?

I haven&amp;#39;t mentioned it to him yet, but thought it might be a good chance for him to take some personal responsibility and track his grades. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do think that&amp;#39;s a pretty crazy reward for just getting your grades right but it&amp;#39;s more or less about the mindset of working towards a goal, which he never has. I was thinking about continuing it next year with a camping trip or something. He hasn&amp;#39;t responded very well to the stick, so I might offer a carrot. However, I don&amp;#39;t know if it even is a good idea. But I&amp;#39;m worried about my brother and trying to figure out ways to motivate him to care about school--I also realize that being far away, I have limited influence.

I strive to be the best at whatever I&amp;#39;m doing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not a nervous person as I am able to talk to large groups of people or small groups of customers with no problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know where to go with my career and I guess I&amp;#39;m putting this out here for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To get it off my chest&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maybe there&amp;#39;s someone out there that&amp;#39;s been in this spot and can give me some insight on my next step&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this nonsense.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;"}

I started with the Squat and did a little bit of stretching beforehand and right when I started with the bar only I was starting to feel some pain in my right knee. Like the moment I go fully down and I'm about to push with my toes that's when it become painful. So after doing 5 reps of 2 sets my right knee couldn't handle it anymore so I had to take a break and finish it later.
