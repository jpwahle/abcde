Withheld number.  (At this point, I'll mention that I'm in the UK).\n\nHold on, back up a sec.  Let me give you some more details about me.  It's not too hard to find out info about me, I run my own business, I have a van with my phone number on it, a website, advert in Yellow Pages.  I get phone calls all the time, from withheld numbers.  Let me continue.\n\nMe: Hello?\n\nCaller:  Oh hi, Mr Chaandelirious?  It's Northumbria Police here (equivalent to NYPD, LAPD, etc).\n\nMe: Yessss....\n\nCaller: Um, we've had reports of a suspicious character in the X Neighbourhood carrying a knife recently, wondering if you'd seen anything?\n\nMe: {EH?} Uhm, no, but I don't live in that area, I live in Y neighbourhood...\n\nCaller: Oh, I didn't realise... well they are quite close - have you seen anyone suspicious, carrying a knife?\n\nNow, at this point, I think it's a prank.  The caller seems a bit unsure of himself, and he seems like he's just saying stuff for the sake of it.  I think, at this point, that it's my mate, who was helping me sort the car just the day before.  Come to think of it, I was joking about the fact that I was carrying a penknife - \"Check me out, I'm packing heat!\" - \"No you're not, packing heat is a gun, you're 'tooled up'\".  So I think it's him...\n\nAnyway, back to the convo...\n\nCaller: We've got a description of the person\n{Here we go, here comes my description...}\n\nCaller: He's 5'10, wearing a long, black leather jacket, black boots, with a tattoo on his neck.\n\nDamn. I'm 5'5 at the best of times, no leather gear, no tats.  Not me. Not anyone that I know.  This is getting a bit weird.\n\nMe: Nope, not seen anyone, sorry, can't seem to help.\n\nCaller: Is there anyone else in the house that may have seen anything?\n\nMe: Well, my wife, but I doubt it.\n\nCaller: Can you ask her, now, please.\n\nMe: {At this point, I should have ended the call, but I still had this thought that it may genuinely be the police... so I ask her.  Cue looks of bewilderment, and, of course, no.]\n\nMe: Nope, she hasn't seen anything.\n\nCaller: And what's her name please?\n[I should've said that's going too far, but, in my bewildered trance, I gave it... idiot.]\n\nCaller: Well, if you can think of anything, or if you see anything, please call Northumbria police, and speak to either Mr - er - DC Murphy or DC Goodwin.\n\nMe: Okay, so what number should I call?\n\nCaller: 0191 4xx xxxx, that'll get you through to Mr - er - DC Murphy. Thanks.\n\nThen he hung up.\n\nSo I called the police.  Explained the whole call, that it seemed bizarre, and asked them to look into a) if they have any officers by those names, b) if that was a genuine number, c) if they are looking into a man carrying a knife in the relative neighbourhood.\n\nI called my mate, who says it's funny, but wasn't him, and if it was, he would've done it better.\n\nSo now I've got the police paying me a visit on Saturday to see if I can give them more info.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nLooking back, I think it was someone trying to see if we were in on New Year's Eve - wanting to break in and steal my meager possessions.

She's 20 years old, has a full-time job, and just received her dental assistant certification.  I'm 19, in college, and do not have a job.  Both of us still live with our parents.  It has been suggested that I seek federal aid for students who are parents.  However, since I have a marijuana conviction, I am ineligible for federal aid.  I have no source of income.  But that's not even the worst part.  I know nothing about raising and supporting a human being, since I'm an only child.  I feel like I need to do start preparing **now**, but I don't know what to do!  \n\nMy girlfriend and I have discussed our options.  Abortion and adoption are both out of the question to her, and no one in her family supports either of those options either.  I'm in full support of either, but it's ultimately her decision as to whether or not to keep the child and raise it or choose one of those options.  I know that having a child right now would affect every single aspect of my life.  I would be outcasted from my family.  I have no money saved up nor an income currently, so I know that I need to get on that right now.  My life would become devoted to my child and his\/her needs, which is something I didn't think would happen for another ten years.  There are so many things I have yet to accomplished that I know I wouldn't be able to achieve if I were to have a child to raise.  I don't mean to go \"emo\" on you guys, but this whole thing has me pretty down and feeling like I've thrown away my future and don't want to continue on the downward slope I've been on lately.  From the very bottom of my heart, please help me out with this.  I can't say that I've ever encountered a smarter group of people than that found on Reddit.  And I know that some of you *have* to have experience and great advice here.  I beg you, Reddit, do not forsake me.\n\nEDIT: I'm begging you, Reddit, not \"bedding\" you.  The last thing I need to do right now is have an affair with an entire online community.\n\nEDIT 2:  As far as my conviction: along with the charge, I received what is called Michigan Act 7411.  Under this code, if an individual under the age of 21 completes a one year period of random drug testing along with attending marijuana education classes, the conviction is not able to be seen on public record. I have no idea if that makes a difference or not.\n\nAs far as my degree, I am working toward a major in Spanish and a minor in French (I may work toward a minor in Italian as well at some point in the near future) at a state university in Michigan.\n\nEDIT 3: Now that I'm not pressed for time, I see that something I should have included in here is that my girlfriend and I have been together for almost 15 months.  We've been together since the moment we met.  She is my best friend.  She would have to fuck up pretty damn bad for me to leave her.  The strange thing is that on Christmas, we were driving home from my dad's house having a pretty deep conversation about what we wanted to do in the future.  She asked me, \"Random question: what would you do if I got pregnant?\"  I told her that I would definitely not expect it and that it would most likely interfere with what I had planned (which included recording an album with my band and going on tour for the summer, followed by studying abroad in Spain for 6 months).  Just three days later, she tells me that she took a pregnancy test because she was a day late and it read positive.  At first, I thought she was just fucking with me, since **fuck**, how coincidental is that?  She took another one on New Year's Eve and it also read positive.  I guess there's still chance of something going wrong like a chemical pregnancy or miscarriage, but one can't expect that to happen.  I'm sorry, it's going to take me a while to respond to all of your comments, but I appreciate every single one of you who have (so far) contributed your thoughts, advice, or experience.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskReddit","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AskReddit","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Dear Reddit: I'm a 19 year old guy who just found out that he's going to be a father in about nine months.

I work at a Buffalo Wild Wings and my day started out like any other day. I rolled in at 12 and started portioning frozen food on the line like everyone else. Then the rush came and it wasn't terrible, but we were struggling because there were only four people for five stations. We frequently had to ask for managerial help, which they don't enjoy. All but one person in the kitchen was on a double shift, and right as he was ready to leave, we get the news that oh yeah, a hundred people are walking in. Shit. I was about to go on a break, he was about to leave, but no. Usually lunch lasts from about 11-2, but today our lunch rush went all the way to about 5. And to make it worse, these people were ass-holes. They took up the entire bar area, and one person was there waiting on all of them. After they left, she discovers that they left a total of 7 dollars for tips between all the tables. One table seriously left a 42 cent tip for a $25 ticket. At 5 I finally got my break, but when I came back the rush had picked back up. There were now three managers in the kitchen, and 3 angry people on doubles. Lets just say that the kitchen wasn't running as smoothly as it should have been. That rush carried all the way until about 8, and then it occurred to me that there were only 3 people to do closing duties. That also meant since I was senior, I would have to stay and help close. I also knew that we had UFC that night, so while I was scheduled out at 10, It would probably be 1:30 when I got out. The other two people on doubles were relative newbies, and hadn't caught on to the concept that the schedule means nothing. Well, that is you have to come in when you are scheduled, but you get out when you get your shit done. We got our ass kicked by the UFC rush as usual. First out got out at 11, and second out at midnight. He was lucky too. I once had to do fryers on a UFC night, and it was 1am and the manager just sent me home out of pity. I was working a double that day too. I helped do floors, and the remaining dishes, and got out at 1:30.

At the time she was single, and I was in a 'complicated' relationship. Either way, we were living our lives as single friends. Things were great, were being the key word there. She has since met a guy, fallen 'in love' and now spends most of her time with him-- which is not a problem, if it wasn't in OUR HOUSE. I cannot take it any longer. \n\nHe has spent the past week here, leaving briefly to get clothes or whatever the hell it is the OCD bastard thinks he wants. He turns up, or will arrange it with her without her informing me (and I kind of feel like I should know) and he'll use our kitchen, shower, and bitch at me for my television choices. They sit on the sofa nexto me wrapped up together and I can hear them kissing over anything I'm trying to watch. \n\nThe other night I was watching one of my favourite tv programmes, and he insisted on talking the whole way through. I eventually told him to shut up, but he didn't. He then mocked me for it. They spend ages in the kitchen preparing their meals and I can't get into it. MY OWN FUCKING KITCHEN. He wakes me up in the mornings singing in our shower, or pisses me off late at night when they're drunk and he's making loads of noise. \n\nThe reason I'm posting is because my flatmate and I just had a huge fight over electricity. We had three lights on and I wanted to turn the main one off, she insisted on keeping it on because she's 'eating.' Normally she'd be fine with it off, but now all of a sudden because the boyfriend is here, it's as if she's trying to put on a show and look strong or some shit. She's changed, and I can't take it. Plus, I hate the boyfriend and it's clear he fancies me. She feels that way too, which is also something clearly playing on the back of her mind. \n\nI don't do this to her with my boyfriend. I don't roll about on our sofa's making out infront of her. He even butted in our argument to inform me that the last 3 times he's been here my 'dishes have been in the sink, dirty.' \n\nAm I being unreasonable in thinking I have a say in this? Is it wrong of me to expect a little fucking quiet time when I return home from work? I'm 21, she's 27 &amp; he's 28 yet I feel like the old bag here.\n\nEDIT: Not to mention the day my relationship fell apart, they were literally rolling around my living room floor together making out and stuff right infront of me.

I weighed 180lbs or so, and was quite muscular.  I am 5'10\" and now weigh 270lbs.  What happened?  Well, my dad kicked me out of the house and I became homeless.  Having too much stupid pride, I refused to ask any of my friends for help and wound up on the streets of Toronto.  I couldn't afford food thus didn't eat.  I finally managed to get a job and a place to live (Jane and Finch area... one of the worst areas!).  Anyways, to make a long story short, I was told that my body went into 'starvation mode', and I subsequently packed on the pounds.  In three months I ended up gaining over forty pounds and simply couldn't stop gaining.  I got up to 300 pounds about a year and a half ago and ended up losing about 30 to the weight I am now... University has me busy all the time and my only relaxation is cooking... \n\nI have remained muscular beneath these horrible layers of fat.  I'm an oddly muscular fat guy -- in my job, my strength is well known and I'm always the go to guy for jobs requiring the latter.  I'm ultimately aiming to be at about 200 pounds. \n\nI guess I'm just hoping for some help and maybe some support in this endeavor.  Has anyone successfully managed to shed a ton of unnecessary weight? Does anyone have any pointers for me?\n\nThis is my first self post, and I know I'm leaving myself open to a bit of ridicule, but I think that if I end up healthy, it would all be worth it.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nEDIT: Wow!  Thanks for all the input, everyone!  Its very encouraging to receive so much support, advice and encouragement!  As there are so many comments, I won't respond to all of them, but I'll do my best.  Heck, I may even send updates as the next few months progress!\n\nEDIT: Thanks again for all of your advice, everyone!  I'm on day three of my new regime -- my university has a great gym and I've been going daily thus far (of course, its only day three, but hey, its a start).  I've cut my caloric intake by, well, a lot, while trying to balance the necessary protein, fibre, carbs, etc (having a doctor for a sister has its benefits).

In a healthy relationship for more then a year now. This is going good for both of us, and i've never been in such a harmonous relationship before, yet I am not able to enjoy it in full, nor dedicate myself emotionaly as much as I should, due to past events with a crazy\/disturbed ex.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about 2,5 years ago. I was few months after leaving a long relationship (we've been a couple, and we still are friends, but her lack of intrest in sex of any kind was too much for me to bear and it blocked our relationship to become a family)and after few months of being single I've met my **ex**. \r\n\r\n\r\nI would describe myself as fairly stable, self-aware guy, but what happened with us was like a bushfire to put it mildly. She was obviously very pretty, smart and funny, and I basically fell for it from the first minute, like never before. Maybe it was due to my prolonged abstinence, or attractive DNA, or chemistry, or just pure infatuation. \r\n\r\n\r\nOf course there was a dark secret that she shared with me immedietly (sic!): she was single but divorced and was raped by her husband, all within only three months of being married, and the whole legal thing was not yet acomplished (although it has been already 1 year since they separated so she was single). She also said she will probably will end up dating a homeless guy, because all other will not be interested in here anymore. I did not pay enough attention to that proclamation, but it was too late for me anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo me that did not seam like a big problem, as my love was brewing and i felt (stupidly) invincible. She was first to proclaim love verbaly within few weeks (not really knowing me by then), which for me was little bit too soon, but still  it was enthusiasticaly welcomed by me. \r\n\r\n\r\n**What followed was an 8 month romance, with perpetual abuse, and emotional highs.** \r\nShe turned out to have these semi regular shifts in mood, where every two weeks she would burst in almost uncontrolable verbal abuse towards me, that would deny and destroy everything that was beautiful between us.This would end with a honeymoon weekend afterwards. It's almost as if she became another person, hardly rememmbering what was said and done during those negative moments. Some of it was left in emails or chats, so we tried to talk about it later on, but I guess I chikened out the first time, and later it was too late (too much emotions...). At first I though its because of her painfull past, but with time it turned out it's just the way she is, and that I myself was on the highway to become yet another nasty man who could only hurt her, as all those before have done before. I did not know that by then, but now I see I was lost the moment made the first step.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a history of \"fixing my girlfriends\" in relationships, and a red light was flashing in the back of my head, but i was so madly in love I dove into her soul to convince her my love was genuine and powerful to carry us both even in the darker times. Of course I failed, the deeper I went, the more aggresive and destructive for our relationship she would become. And the higher we would get in the moments of return. This in itself worked like a powerfull drug. By the time a second guy got involved, and all sexual secrets of her ex were known to me (\"WTF! i did not need to know all those things you did with him!\"),  plus a physical punch to my face plus two weeks of silence and absence on her part while I was going through some medical stuff, I decided its time to rescue myself. I would cry in random moments when alone, and it felt like my brain was being fucked with. No longer did I remmember who said what first, slowly I began to see myself the way that she saw me , and that was scary.\r\n\r\n\r\nI dumped all things related to her, but she in the middle of the night placed like 100 sticky red hearts on my car, to try to win me back. \r\n\r\n\r\n(A friend of mine said when looking at my VW with red hearts all over it: \"wow, this is real love!\". Myself , being so tired and destroyed after 8 months of 2 week-cycles of love'n'hate, I replied: \"No, this is not love, this is my car with sticky hearts all over it\". )\r\n\r\n\r\nI've met with her one last time to tell her that it is over, at least for a longer period of time. I tried to be as assertive as I could, not judge, not dimish, just openly say that I can't bear it anymore, and I need to be alone. What followed was an vigorous and passionate love proclamation on her part, begging for forgiveness and empty rationalisations of why it will never happend again. Yet, as soon as she realized I've already made my mind, and that I am realy perched and dead inside and I simply can't give any more: **she spewed a single most viscious, castrating curse at me I could ever imagine**. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn shock, but still standing,  i looked deep into the abyss of her eyes and said: \"I guess this is where your endless love comes down to in real life...\". She ran away terrified and I never saw her again....\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's been more then 2 years since then and I am still there. \r\n\r\n\r\nI keep thinking about that situation, words and events come back as flashbacks, both negative and positive. I spy on my ex via internet on some nights, although we have zero contact. I have a hard time focusing on important things, it's hard to have a really close relationship with my current GF, as much as I would like to. I escape into gaming, if I have rush of memmories, shooting or driving calms me down, helps the time go by. I guess I am just tired from that f*ing triangle I am still in, i just want to be free, and be only with the one girl who really deserves that.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI feel as if the intensity and amplitude of that crazy marry-go-round was too much for my nervous system at that moment, and all my fuses were burned in the process. In particular I am blocked to say word **\"love\"** again, although I would like to be able to say that now, and propouse to my GF. Yet, nothing can compare to what I felt before, and all else just feels plain, flat and rational....\r\n\r\n\r\nI never did any hard drugs, so I don't know what it is like, but I guess I can imagine little bit, why it is tough to go back to real life after being on such extreme levels of high. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy current GF does not know anything, as I want to protect her from things that can only make her life more difficult. After all she can not do anything to what happened in the past, I can only hope this will subside with time...\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it is hard to be alone with that burden, and here is there reason why I created that dummy account and i write those words. I also have been meeting with my therapist for 2 years now, and she was perfect to be there and listen to all highs and lows, occiasionaly giving her own feedback. But all that does not help the situation and it has been already 2 years.....\r\n\r\n\r\nI am terrified of having a *Pigmalion* syndrom, where I need to work on my partners, fix them, and when I get the single healthy one, I just can't fix anything with her, and can't attach. I don't know if that is true, but it is a nasty stuff, i much more preffere a normal person that is just fine by herself, and does not have psyche problems that need work by me or her.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet, my heart (if I still have one), my emotions, my memories are there, with a person who does not deserve it, nor respects them. I guess this is a blasphemy of sorts, but perhaps guys returning from Iraq have it little simmilar hard to adapt to normal life, at least that is what I felt after watching *\"Hurt Locker\"* movie. After seeing the most beautiful flowers, children, emotions, pictures torn to pieces and shreds, its hard to enjoy them again. YOu just know how easy it is to kill them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main reason I write this is the other topic on Reddit recently about Michael Angelo effect. This has certainly brough tears into my eyes, because it rezonates with my sould so much and yet I failed so terffibly on the way to realize something like that. The dream, the vision of what we could have been \"if only...\" makes it really hard to live here and now. Which is the only life i have really, so its not like I have options.

We met right out of high school and were both content with puttering around for a while (I was naive\/dumb\/etc. and apathetic about a post-secondary education).  For the past 5 years, I've had a growing itch for a college education, but I've always had an excuse not to go.  I want this to be the year.  I'm 26 and I'm feeling more than ever that I'll be stuck in an endless string of food service\/temp work and I really, really do not want this.  My boyfriend had a string of temp jobs until deciding on becoming a police officer.  He's always had luck on his side and now he's got a job that he loves (and could retire from eventually if he wanted).  The thing is, when I mentioned that I would like to also find a job I could love\/possibly retire from, and that I would probably need college to do so, he became upset.  He told me why he was upset:\n\n* We'll barely see each other.\n* I might not even get a job in whatever I decide to major in.\n\nHe used his friends as examples (a lot of them have college educations but either don't get jobs applying to their major or got a job they like by having friends on the inside).  I, however, have friends who HAVE received jobs pertaining to their majors(though I still know a couple who don't).  I feel college could really help me out.  I've always done well with direction.  I'm just not a very independent go-getter.  I feel I need guidance(hah, which is why I'm here..).\n\n* College graduates, how much did college help you get into the profession you are in today?  \n* Is it worth it?\n* What major\/s would be the most useless? The most useful?\n\nPlease note: I'm not totally naive.  I understand that majoring in Art or Journalism for example, probably wouldn't get me very far in this type of economy (unless I was freaking awesome at it)..

I am 26, a switch and this is my first experience as dom (but never did any real-life subbing either).\r\nBtw, English is not my native language so forgive my grammar.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe're in the living room with a glass of wine, I'm chatting with e and j. e is sitting beside me, she is fourty years old, blond hair wearing a simple skirt an blouse. I'm stroking her thigh as we speak while j, her 43 year old husband is sitting in the chair next to the couch.\r\nI empty my glass and set it away as I lean towards e. I kiss her, she kisses back and I let my hand explore up from her thigh to her waist and breasts. \"Come, take your shirt off.\" I say in a jovial way. Her beautiful breasts held in a sexy bra emerge. \"Come, take off all your clothes.\" I propose. Still sitting on the couch she takes off her bra, skirt and panties.\r\n\r\nWhile I kiss her again and stroke her naked body, I ask her suggestively: \"What shall we do with your husband?\" We both look in j's direction. \"Come stand in front of us, j\", I say. \"..and take of your clothes, I would like to see your dick.\" j undresses and stands with his completely shaven penis in front of us. I take his balls and inspect his penis. \"Why don't you kneel?\", I suggest.\r\n\r\nI spread e's legs so j has a clear view on her pussy. I continue feeling her up; I squeeze her breasts gently en let my fingers run over her labia. With both hands I spread her lips wide open. I softly massage het pussy and ask her, after a kiss \"e, I want you to surrender to me.. will you do as I say?\", she says yes. \"Repeat what I say: 'yes, I'll do whatever you'll command'\", dutifully she repeats my words. I then ask her to kneel in front of me as well. \"Put your hands on the ground in front of you.\", she bends forwards and I caress her hair, neck and back. \"j, go kneel behind e and also put down your hands in front of you\". \"Look at her pretty feet, worship them and lick her soles.\" I get up and walk behind j to see if he follows my order properly. I let my hands run over his back down to his ass. My fingertips lightly touch his anus. I massage his balls and pull on his dick, then my hand goes back to his ass. \"I'm going to use this nice, available ass.\" I inform him. \"Go up slowly, and lick your wife's anus.\"\r\n\r\nI get back on the couch. \"Come sweetheart\" I say to e, \"Undo my belt and open my zipper. Get my dick out, I want you to suck it softly. And see your spit run freely.\" After letting them work for a while, I take off my pants and ask j to come to me. \"I want you to see exchange saliva using my hard dick.\" I let them alternately suck my balls and my penis. I pull up my legs slightly, \"e, lick up the spit the runs over my ass.\"\r\n\r\nI take them both up to the bedroom, and ask them to lie on the bed. I lay down besides j and offer him my nipple, \"Come, suck..\", I encourage him, while I put my arm around his head. \"e, grab a latex glove and the lube... Carefully start making his ass supple for me.\". I then go down a little and reach for his dick. \"Pull my dick\" I command j. I push my lips on his while we pull each others dick and his wife slides her fingers in his ass.\r\n\r\n\"Go lay on your back\", I command j. \"Come e, make use of the oral services you husband can provide.\" Then I get up, get a buttplug and put it in his ass. e meanwhile sits on top of j and pushes her pussy in his face. I position myself behind her and lift up her ass. I let my hard cock slid inside her right above his nose. \"Keep licking! Lick my cock!\" I start fucking her, increasingly harder. I push her head down. \"e, I want to hear you moan with his dick in your mouth.\" \r\nAs I come I pull my cock out and I shoot my sperm over her anus and labia. It slowly starts dripping down. \"Why don't lick us nice and clean, open your mouth\" I say to j. I lower my half-hard dick with my sperm still on it in his mouth. \"Suck it off\"...","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BDSMcommunity","subreddit_id":"t5_2r9tk","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BDSMcommunity","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Fantasy for couple I am about to dominate","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BDSMcommunity\/comments\/alsgi\/fantasy_for_couple_i_am_about_to_dominate\/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw"}

Absolutely bat shit crazy about him.\n\nWe've been doing long distance for over a year now (both from the same hometown, going to different schools), and for the whole time I've known him he's been struggling with what he wants - he kind of got shoved into a university program he wasn't sure about, but that everyone else told him it would get him where he wanted. Ends up, the program is not only insanely difficult, but wont get him anywhere near what he wants to do.\n\nAfter getting increasingly more and more frustrated with his program, I helped him find the program that WILL get him to what he wants to do. The original plan was for him to finish the program he was in this year (ie. done in April 2010), and then apply to go into the other program in the fall (Sept 2010). He started this year off decently enough, but ended up failing a couple classes because he got sick and just couldn't keep up. He doesn't want to do another useless year to finish a program he isn't interested in, so his parents convinced him to drop out, live at home, get a job and work for a while to figure things out.\n\nMeanwhile, the stress of trying to keep up with his program got him on anti-anxiety meds, his school therapist suggested he might have a form of depression, and now after dropping out of school he feels like a failure.\n\nBefore deciding to drop out, he and I would constantly talk about the future we would have together - it was reassuring for both of us to think that, once we get through the next little while apart, then we can get a place together, get a cat, wake up next to eachother every morning... all that fabulous stuff. Since making up his mind to drop out, anytime I mentioned anything more than a week in advance he started to get skittish. His future is so uncertain to him right now that he can't commit to anything. The program he's applying to has a portfolio component to the application, and he thinks he isn't good enough to get in. He feels emotionally vacant, defeated, and talentless. I wish I could do something for him, but I just don't know what do to since I'm now back at school.\n\nYesterday, the day after I got back to school after Christmas break, he sent me a message saying he thought we should take a break. He said that the stress of having to live at home with his parents, trying to find a job, having to go back to the school to say goodbye to his friend and get his stuff, feeling like a failure, the anxiety and depression, dealing with applying to school, and general feelings of emotional vacancy were enough to deal with, and that he can't cope with a relationship on top of that too right now. He still cares about me and I still love him. I'm not planning on seeing anyone else (I can't even think of anyone else that way), and he told me he obviously isn't going to see anyone because the reason for the break is that he can't handle a relationship right now. He can't tell me how long he needs, because he doesn't know when he'll feel like himself again.\n\nI feel numb and half-dead - everything reminds me of him, and I'm so used to being in almost constant contact with him. I have to fight the urge to constantly send him little messages because he wants his space. We agreed to keep talking, because we're each others' best friend too, but I don't know what is too much and what is too little. The part that hurts the most right now is when I asked if I could still tell him that I loved him, he said \"you can, but I probably won't be able to say it back\". I know he still cares a lot, but he just can't handle this right now.\n\nAnyway, after sharing all that, has anyone gone through something similar? Did you get back together? Do you have any advice of how I can be there for him while still giving him space?\n\nThanks Reddit, I love you guys.\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend is having a crisis - just dropped out of school, has to find a job, living with parents, has to apply to schools, has anxiety, is depressed, feels emotionally vacant, and wants to take a break from our relationship to find himself again. Looking for support\/advice.\n\nEdit: Forgot to include - I am 21, he is 22.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationship_advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0cn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/relationship_advice","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Boyfriend going through a crisis - wants to take a break.

The tl;dr at the top pretty much explains the issue in full, but for anyone who wants more of the story, my apologies for the length:\n\nI have been an overweight individual for my entire life.  While it often comes across as a joke, I can almost pinpoint the start of my weight gain to when my family got a satellite dish receiver when I was in the fourth grade.  Going from three fuzzy channels to hundreds of clear ones started my sedentary lifestyle young.\n\nAt my \"adult\" height and top weight I entered my Freshman year of college at 6'3'' and 265lbs.  I was able to slowly but surely make little lifestyle changes,  one good summer job walking about 10 miles a night for a security gig and I graduated college last spring at 184lbs.  I have fluctuated between 180 and 192ish (where I sort of freak and get serious about staying under 190)  for the last 9 months or so.  \n\nI have never considered my weight loss goals \"achieved\" specifically because I don't care what a scale ( or a bf%) says, I just want to look good, not scary body builder, just good.  To anyone who hasn't ever been overweight, you have no idea how pleasant the thought of taking your shirt of at the beach and not being 100% self conscious is, taking your shirt of in bed goes along those same lines.   \n\nOver Christmas break my weight loss was brought up in a conversation with my girlfriend and a mutual friend, and the concept of the \"hairy bagel\" was brought up.  In short, you simply grab the excess skin around your navel, push together, and BAM, hairy bagel.  As you might be able to gather from this headline, I want it gone, and I want 2010 to be the year it happens.  So to lay things out nice and official.  \n\nGoal:  To lose the remaining fat and excess skin in my stomach area known as \"The Hairy Bagel\"\n\nPlan:  I feel like I need to revamp both my exercise regime and my diet.  The first 80lbs were seemingly easy to take off with a hodgepodge of not drinking soda, staying away from fast food, and getting intermittent exercise.  However to finish off the hairy bagel, I think I need a more focused effort.  This is where I would like help from \/r\/fitness especially from anyone who has overcome this issue themselves.  I'm making a particular effort to do this now because I'm 23 and I figure I've got the best chances of fixing this now. \n\nCurrent Stats -  I was sort of lazy over the last two weeks with the holidays.  But these are my most recent statistics or the best estimate there of:\n\nMile Run: I have no reliable way to check my mile run. (not a member of a gym, not tracks near by).  There is a community exercise path in the area that is 2.98 miles around, my best time running this was just about 26 minutes. \n\nPush Ups: 45 within a 2 minute period, but only about 30 if I go from start to collapse without a break. \nPull Ups:  4, if I'm luckily (but I can't tell you how proud I was of the first one after not being able to do one my whole life :) )\nChin UPs:  7\n\nI have done some other home fitness type exercising with dumbells and such, but nothing standardized enough to share really.  \n\nI have sort of set a \"low weight\" in my head at 170lbs.  I have no interest in being underweight, and don't pay all that much attention to the scale in that regard.  I would be perfectly happy at 200lbs if I had abs showing.\n\nIf you've read up until now, thanks!  Hopefully I'll be able to update this post in 2011 with a success story :)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Fitness","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhx4","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Fitness","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"The End of the Hairy Bagel","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Fitness\/comments\/alvva\/the_end_of_the_hairy_bagel\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

She's in Colorado, a state with some medical marijuana laws, but I don't think the amount she thinks she  will be growing will be within the bounds of the law. She is desperate to save her home. She has been fighting foreclosure for something like two years now, and can't work due to a severe neck injury she suffered falling down some stairs. She can't even get treatment for her neck, which gives her constant pain, so she's willing to do just about anything to fix this.\n\nMy little brother, age 19, is quite the little weed entrepreneur, and has had his ups and downs being involved in \"the game\" (sorry, I just lost it, too), but he is pretty confident he knows what he's doing. I'm 36 and I've done most of the same shit, probably worse shit, so I understand to some degree what they will be getting involved with. He thinks they can keep it a secret, and I don't think it's possible, especially when you're 19. I couldn't keep my mouth shut when I was 19.\n\nI used to grow weed in a house I lived in. It was a lot of work, I was paranoid all the time, and we got robbed one day (I wasn't there but my roomie got maced, luckily not shot), which ended up being the beginning of the end for our operation, and I was much happier when it was all over, and not that much poorer. But I was probably smoking most of my profits, a problem my mother won't have as she does not partake in the smoking of the weed.\n\nI have no moral reservations about growing marijuana, my concern is for my mom's safety and mental health. I don't think she could handle the mental strain caused by living on top of a room which is full of cash (in weed form), and I certainly don't want anyone in my family being robbed at gunpoint or anything else. My advice to her was to let my bro do it, but make it part of the budget to  rent her a modest apartment away from the grow house, where she could sleep without worrying. What would you recommend?

I need your help picking a new TV.  Now that I'm 32 years old, I figured it was time to buy my first TV.  No, I'm not one of those \"I don't watch TV\" snobs, I've just always inherited TVs from family, which means all my current sets are small and weigh a ton.\n\nMy goal is to spend about $2000 on a 55\" (or bigger) flatscreen + blue-ray player and entry level surround sound.  I basically want something that will fill my living room, let me play games and watch movies, and watch the occasional live sporting event.\n\nPer some previous recommendations, I had pretty much settled on [this 55\" Samsung](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Samsung-LN55B650-55-Inch-1080p-Touch\/dp\/B001WHICF0\/ref=sr_1_1), which is an LCD (and available cheaper elsewhere).  \n\nThen I went to Fry's yesterday to check it out, and right next to it they had the LED version for just $200 more, and boy was it beautiful.\n\nSo here are the questions:\n\n1. Is the LED worth the extra expense right now, or should I wait?\n2. Where can I get the best deal, especially any package deal with a blue-ray and surround sound (I'm not really familiar with the deal sites anymore)?\n3. Any other suggestions to help me better achieve my goal?\n\nThanks!

I'm 21 years old, male, fairly healthy. Every day for me is pretty much the same.  Wake up. Two hours on the toilet, get off and not a half hour later, I'll feel some leaking, so then it's back on the shitter. This goes on for the rest of the day, and tapers off somewhere in the evening. Not completely, mind you. It just slows down a bit. \n\nIf I do try to leave the house, liquid seeps from the back of my pants and stains my underwear. I've had to quit my job. I can't have any real relationships. My friends don't know about this, and have all moved on with their lives. The exception is one close friend who I've told, but I barely even get to see. Luckily, I live back with my mom, so I have a place to live rent free, and I'm able to go under her health insurance for now. But I'm tired of being a burden on her. I constantly snap at her because I'm so frustrated. \n\nI'm losing my goddamn mind. I can't take it anymore. This has only been getting worse and worse. Weed used to help, but only really delays the problem. I recently quit, because I could no longer afford it. I've cut out practically everything from my diet, dairy, red meat, fatty foods etc. And as it is now, I barely even eat. \n\nI've seen doctor after doctor and had test after test, and they never know what's wrong. I've tried every fiber supplement and natural remedy, pills, probiotics. I've been tested for parasites, glucose and lactose deficiencies. I've had blood and stool tests, abdominal scan, colonoscopy, upper GI, and several more, all to no avail. I can't fucking deal with it anymore. I literally have no reason to live. I just want to be able to live a normal life, be able to walk around in public, have a regular job. For Christ sakes, I'm only 21 years old. If this is what the rest of my life is going to be like, then I don't see the point in continuing. \n\nThe reason I'm posting this on reddit is on the off chance that someone on here might have had a similar problem. I become quite fond of reddit, having spent so much time on the toilet with my laptop. I know its a long shot, but I know this is a helpful community and maybe somebody might have a solution I haven't heard of. \n\n\nEDIT: Wow. Thanks for the help and support, everyone. I honestly thought I had heard it all. I have a lot of stuff to bring up to my doctor next week. \n\nTo those wondering about my diet. For the past month, I've been on the diet in the book \"Eating for IBS\" by Heather Von Vorou. This basically consists of a diet heavy in soluble fiber, no dairy, no red meat, no high fat foods, coffee ,sodas or alcohol. Specifically, I would eat lots of rice, bread, pasta, chicken, small salads after meals. This hasn't really helped me so much, but if you're suffering with IBS, its worth a shot.  Based on these comments, I'll be starting the gluten free diet today, and see if my symptoms improve. \n\nI DO have some abdominal pain, probably should have mentioned originally, but it's not that intense, mostly in my lower stomach, and on the left, just below my ribcage. \n\nAs far as my poos look, they are usually light brown. I haven't had a solid log in years. Mostly its bits and pieces, liquidy or solid chunks, sometimes in long strands. It's on and off constipation and diarrhea. Whether or not I have constipation or diarrhea, I'll still have the leaking, which is often clear and mucousy, occasionally with bits of poo. I've had some blood, but not often. I thought it was due to me wiping so much. \n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskReddit","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AskReddit","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I'm sick.

I just had to type everything out, for myself.\n\nMy girlfriend who I've known since high school (started online, then we went to college together, about 8 years total) broke up with me. I'm 24, she's 23. We have fought in the past and had our fair share of struggles in our relationship, but we've always loved each other deeply and have talked about marriage. She truly makes me happy, and I once believed I made her happy too.\n\nShe has broken up with me twice this year. While we were broken up she would come over and talk to me because I was so sad, sometimes we would cuddle and kiss, but she wouldn't officially call me her boyfriend again. I was devastated by all this and started going to counseling and taking antidepressants.\n\nShe moved to my city in August, but had been telling me over the summer she wasn't sure if wanted to be with me. She said she wanted to be alone and single. Nevertheless, after a two week break, she contacted me when she fell very sick and had to go to the emergency room. I also once picked her up from a friends house early in the morning when she was throwing up and too sick to drive. I literally held her hair back for hours. I let her sleep in my bed and took care of her. She also agreed to go to a concert with me, but still considered herself single.\n\nAfter hanging out more regularly for a week, she said she couldn't talk to me. Someone from work had asked her on a date, she agreed to go, but he canceled. Then a couple weeks later, after talking to me occasionally, she stopped. She went to a party, saw the guy who asked her out, and she ended up crashing on a giant bean bag chair with him and she initiated cuddling in the morning. She didn't talk to me for a week.\n\nUntil the next weekend, she went to another work-related party and he was there. She asked him to a bar with her and her friends. They ended up sleeping on a futon together. He started making out with her, but she stopped it, and he got really angry because she told him she didn't want to have sex with him or kiss him anymore. She spent a sleepless night on the futon with him, got up around 5am, told him she'd give him a ride back to his car. He said, \"I never want to see you or talk to you again.\"\n\nShe immediately called me and asked if she could come over. I had spent all weekend calling her but she never answered. I was extremely tired but agreed, though I kind of knew something was up. She came to my apartment around 6am, said \"I made out with someone\" and started sobbing. She begged me to be her friend. Initially I was incredibly angry, punching the wall and telling her to leave. I couldn't even look at her. But I quickly forgave her, because I could tell she was sincere. We spent a wonderful week together. She told me she wanted to move in with me, she brought a bag of clothes and things to keep in my apartment, and we considered ourselves a couple again.\n\nBut she wouldn't have sex with me until the last night before she left for home, and it was a struggle just to get her to kiss me. She explained this by saying she felt undeserving of my love because of what happened. I understood, as she has had self-esteem\/depression problems in the past.\n\nShe left for Christmas to see her family and catch up with a couple friends. I bought a plane ticket to accompany her on the ride back. On Christmas Eve we got into an argument and I started pressing her about why, if she left me because she wanted to be single, why did she agree to date this other guy, and pressed her for details and got very mean. On Christmas, after apologizing profusely, she refused to talk to me. She didn't contact me for a week. She was hanging out with a friend and apparently considered herself broken up with me again, because she told him this and they cuddled, kissed,  and shared a bed. No sex. She told him afterward that they should just remain friends. After a week of no contact, she texts me \"I made out with ****\". I was crushed. She wouldn't speak to me and said she wouldn't pick me up at the airport.\n\nTo make her feel my pain (I have never ever done anything with another girl while we were together, but she had one time before, years ago), I told her I was going to get laid. She begged me not to sleep with another girl. The next day I lied to her and said \"I got a blowjob\" and she believed it. She was crushed. She told me \"I still love you, please come see me, etc.\" A few hours later I told her I made it up. But she had already freaked out and told her parents, believed I really did get a blowjob. She refused to speak to me for days. She told me not to pick her up at the airport because I humiliated her and her parents hated me (why she told them, I don't know). I canceled my plane ticket. I called her and texted her constantly, and was really annoying to her. Her dad (who ended up driving with her, called me and said \"She doesn't want to see you. You just have to let her go.\" I've spent about a week sobbing.\n\nNow, she's back here, ten minutes away, but won't speak to me. She says we're broken up. I begged to see her and talk to her about this and told her I was incredibly hurt (I am). She texted me: \"No. I'm sorry.\" \"You need to let me alone for a while.\" I just want to have time to myself to think.\" and finally, \"I don't think I ever want to be with you again though.\"\n\nI've been having panic attacks and started self medicating. I have a friend (who's been through a break up like this) who's also helping me get by. I break down and cried at work yesterday. I begged and begged her to talk to me and see me, but she just says she \"can't see me.\" She won't tell me why.\n\n**TL;DR:** The woman I believed I would spend my life with won't speak to me.
