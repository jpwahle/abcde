All three were vanilla versions with all official dlc's available.\n\nMorrowind: \n\nI will admit, when i began to play this game, i hated it, hated every single second of playing it, it was pain for me and it lasted around \\`\\`10 hours. Walking was slow, dialogues were very strange, all npc's offering same reading material,  i lost my will to read, navigation on world map was pain, and it was difficult to understand what i am even doing, so these 10 hours literally took my like a month, then i started reading guides, what caught my Eye first was the lore. The lore of Morrowind was no doubt best of all the series i played, Battle for the red mountain, Disappearance of the Dwemer, Vampire clans, and their quests,  Rivalry between the Great houses, the sixt House itself, the appearance of the Dreamers in game was perfect addition, they made you realize something big is happening,  and feel that you are part of it.  I Loved reading lore books,  i loved getting hang on how to travel with mages guild, silt stryders, propylon indices and spells. How well,  i was doing made me feel like nerevarine, someone special.  My play style brute force type of guy with shield and sword, i was playing wood elf, but especially later in the game,  i played a lot with magic abilities, and i was amazed by the freedom that game offered.  There were no limits, no inaccessible areas, no nothing, you could fly, you could jump whole map, the only limit seemed to be your imagination, and that's what i wanted from RPG.\n\nWhat i also loved about this game, was the atmosphere and the music, the music was great in all elder scrolls games, so i will not explain on it any further. But i really liked the landscape of Morrowind and how different it was on different parts of the map. I also liked that killing one NPC could break several quests for you and it was like that only in Morrowind, it made me feel like the whole world is connected, they all exist together in the same plane, on the other hand, many quests were boring,  bring NPC from place x to place Y. Get item from place X and bring it to place Y and so on. And after i finished the game, i really really wanted to replay it instantly, but since i am short on time all the time, i decided to go for Oblivion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOblivion:\n\nOblivion was game of contrasts for me, from extremely good, to extremely bad.  I got hooked on it instantly, probably because of interesting quests, there were a lot of amazing side quests in the game, f.e. i loved Dark Brotherhood side quest, Paranoia quest in Skingrad,  or the Hackdirt sidequesti did not even do main quest, for until i finished almost all side quests, and Shivering Isles DLC should be mentioned here separately since it was amazing, every single detail about it, on the other hand, i was little disappointed in thieves guild quest line. In Morrowind they were serious organization to which people ask to get things done and in Oblivion... you did errand's for leader to get his love back, wtf? And talking about bad quests,  main quest was probably worst. WHen you approach Martin, he sees you for the first time, you tell him you are emperor's son, and he is like if you say so, let's play along with it... And i could not play along with it so the main quest left me disappointed. Some stuff looked lame because of engine limitations probably, but when you help all towns and they send 15 bravest men to defend in the event which if unsuccessful could be end of the world, made me really feel apart from the events happening. Where Oblivion shined was the cities, i loved how  they each had their own architectural style, from different real world eras or countries all of them were beautiful, as were the surroundings outside of the city gates. And then there is one more thing NPC's... and its not only about beyond dumb conversations between them, but when you approach furious NPC, you ask some random question, and then he calmly treats you like best friend suddenly, i really received those wtf moments, and there were plenty. And those npc conversations, well, honestly i do not even know if it's a plus for a game or a minus, probably both. After completion of the game, i started skyrim, but time to time, i load my oblivion save, to run around with my 151 speed character, or just  enjoy beautiful landscapes\/towns. In Oblivion i played for sneaky thief Khajiit .\n\nSkyrim:\n\nWell, i am not a graphics slave, my favorite game of all time is still fallout 2 till this day, but skyrim did offered technological improvements. i really liked how spells were cast, i think it was huge improvement compared to other games in the series. The map was really huge, it took my like 75 hours, to get to every landmark location of the game.  But it was also a minus for the game,  map was huge, but that's it, most locations were looker likes of each other, and i started to miss that diversity of Morrowind or Oblivion, same could be told about cities of Skyrim, i would rate them as far inferior to those of Oblivion.  And for me it was hard to get hang of the the game, can't say i did not get hooked, but it was not immersive, it was hard to even understand what quest is mainquest,  is it fight between stormcloacks and empire? is it dragonborn training? is it the one with blades?  They all looked like sidequests, and there was most of the time like 40 active quests at same time. that felt more like burden, than big game or something.  Most of the quests were also pale,  and started like you will need to do that and that, but ended in kill that dungeon boss.  Also from games like fallout 2, i was used that if you ask for work from NPC, they give you either hints to quets, or start them at instant, but in skyrim, i was afraid to ask for work, since most of the time, i was just filled with garbage radiant quests.  What was an improvement, was the customization of your property, i loved how i could build my house and build what i wanted in it. When playing Oblivion i did not want to play with followers,  but in skyrim it felt like a must for me, not for the huge help, but i was in warewolf and vampire tag team. it just felt right :)  I was playing for the stormcloacks and i thought after i finnish i will do another Empire run, but after ending the game, well, i just did not have any feel for giving it a second go. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what is the conclusion? Its hard to say, well this game is best, this game is worst, i feel like none of them is perfect, and non of them is worse, they each excel at some points and lack in others, and i feel like i would load each of them time to time, to hang out in games and chill. A little disappointment in them all was, that all were GOTY versions, but they still kept crashing constantly, like every 5 hours or so. IF i would still have gun in my head and would need to say pick one, i would probably say. Morrowind, just don't shoot me, so will you?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"skyrim","subreddit_id":"t5_2s837","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/skyrim","subreddit_subscribers":1316273,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Elder scrolls 3\/4\/5 comparison, the good, the bad and the ugly in my opinion","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.75,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/skyrim\/comments\/t3tuvm\/elder_scrolls_345_comparison_the_good_the_bad_and\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I've been fapping multiple times a day for over a decade and have struggled with acne the entire time. Of course, acne often does not have a single cause: first I fixed my skin care routine (washing my face, using the right products, changing pillow cases, etc). My skin got better but my face still looked like an ever-changing archipelago with active volcanos. Okay.. then I changed my diet (no dairy, low glycemic, no saturated fats, no inflammatory foods). My face got even better. No cystic acne and less redness but my face still didn't clear.\n\nAfter reflecting to determine periods when my skin has been clearest, I realized that they were times I didn't fap. Now after a 5 day streak, my face is the clearest it has been since I used Accutane. (I relapsed from it). Despite conventional wisdom, I know for a fact that fapping causes acne for me. I'm assuming it's the orgasm itself rather than just fapping. So here's my problem: I can stop PM forever. I can change that part of my lifestyle. But I don't want to give up sex. *How do I balance acne and sex?* For those who have been in a similar position, after a long enough streak do your hormones eventually balance out so it's not a concern? Do you have to limit your sex life significantly? Any suggestions?

I told my brother everything and we went to check what's going on. I took a flashlight and started finding the reason of the sound. Suddenly, I realised that my brother is not holding my hand. I whispered,\" Jake..Jake ! This is not the time to play hide n seek\". I heard Jake's voice saying,\" Dave..help me Dave. He got me.\" \"He ? Who's he ?\" I said,but iwas only replied by the silentless of the night.**\n\n**I started searching him in the house. Finally, I went in the basement. I heard Jake crying in pain. That's when saw two red glowing eyes. I went pale. I hovered my flashlight on the eyes, and what I saw was terrifying . It was a big creature with big,long nails. His nails were covered in blood and flesh. Jake was lying dead beside with deep cuts and wounds on his body. His head was smashed and his brain was lying next to his lifeless body. I ran to my  parents room and told them everything. They too were shocked to see  the  gruesome scenery. The creature had disappeared and was never seen again.  The police said  it was a accident. It's been 10 years since that incident. I'm 19 now and still shiver when I remeber the incident.** \n\nHere's mine so far, :  \n\n**It was a normal Saturday night. It felt amazing outside, me and my brother played for hours in the backyard, until we were sore and exhausted. We played football, frisbee, etc. As we walked inside at a late 8:45, I asked my brother what he wanted to do. “ Hey Dustin, I’m really tired but shouldn’t we do something before we hit the hay?” I asked, hoping for him to say yes.** \n\n**“ Uh, yes actually. I wanted to check out the basement.” he said with a grin. Before I continue further, here's some backstory. At that time, I was 8 years old.I was a short, stubby little kid with blue eyes and brown hair.**  \n\n**I am now 13 years old. Now, I’m more of a lean build with bleached blonde hair.**\n\n**My brother was also 8 at the time, he was kind of like a twin, as he looked exactly the same. My father died serving in the navy so we had to move, since my mother couldn’t support the house without my dad. Anyways, me and my single mother moved into a new house. This new house was in a rural area, we lived in a small cabin with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom.  Me and my hyper-active brother shared a bunk-bed. This house was relatively small with a huge backyard and a neighboring forest.

Okay, background first.\n\nI'm a 25 year old human male who works at a company that makes multi-species friendly public transportation. Think city busses, subway trains, cable cars, the like. I was recently put in charge of a program that oversees the conversion of the busses we sell from diesel to clean alternative energy like hydrogen. As such, I needed additional team members, as it was a big project, so me and my boss (great dude, 119 M Elf who was a guest professor at my college, and I took a few of his engineering classes so we already have a good working relationship) decided to put together some interviews. A few people from around the company didn't make the cut, some did, and then I got sick on the final interview day, so my boss interviewed the final candidate alone. Lucky it was a 4 day weekend for me, but when I got back to work my boss brought around the new engineer he brought to the team.\n\nMeet the subject of this story; Meet Elva, a 275 year old female dragon-human hybrid. All the mannerisms of a dragon, along with the wings and the tail, in the body of a 6 foot tall human. I'm 5'10, by the way, to get a sense of scale. Anyway, my boss Yyormandine introduces me to Elva, and I take her on a tour of the facility, as it was her actual first day at work. I teach her the basics of using her computer and the programs, and I teach her about what we do. We finish before lunch, and I go back to my desk to eat my sandwich. When I get back, I get a call. From Elva. Stating her computer is acting up and she doesn't know what's going on. \"No big deal, the laptops are outdated here anyway\" I say, and I head over to her desk. When I get there, her computer screen is off, the fans are loud, and she has no idea what to do. After fixing her computer (turns out she sent it into a BIOS update), I head back to my desk, and finish my sandwich. This exact same thing happened 13 more times over the course of 4 hours, from 1 to 5 pm. Which hurt my paperwork schedule dearly.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I went from enjoying her company to getting slightly annoyed to getting scared of her. She always barged right into my office without asking permission or knocking, held me up in tight corners or thin hallways, and even followed me into the bathroom once, even after I showed her where the bathrooms were. I was getting scared, and talked to my boss about it, but Yyormandine told me \"it's just what they do sometimes. You've never heard of dragons getting possessive of certain people or things? It's why they're known to have hoards.\" The realization hit me like a clean-energy bus. I was being stalked because Elva had a crush, which I refuse to reciprocate.\n\nAfter that, Elva not only started to try and get closer and closer to me on purpose, but she also lashed out at fellow team members for getting close to me, I fear over violating her wanting to be the only one near me. It started to scare people off, and scare people away from not just being on my team for the project, but away from the entire wing of the building my team was situated in. I felt like I had a total violation of my privacy here that wasn't being considered because Elva was being \"possessive\".\n\nThe last straw was when she followed me home from work. I obviously drive a car, and our offices are located conveniently near the freeway. I often see dragons flying over my head as I drive, which is a cool sight. But, Elva memorized my truck and it's license plate, because as soon as I pulled into the driveway at my house, she swooped in behind me and touched down, waving all friendly-like. I, being the coward I am, screamed and ran inside, locking my door. She stayed outside on my porch for an hour before getting bored and flying off.\n\nI used to like her as a co-worker and enjoyed her company, but now she's become so possessive of me and stalker-ish I'm afraid of leaving my house at all, even if she knows where I live! So far I've stayed home twice for virtual meetings and to work on my truck (first time was it shredded an alternator belt, second time was the rear suspension collapsed), and she flew in both times to ask if I was okay! This is a blatant invasion of my privacy and my private life and it is taking a toll on my private and work life, and especially my health.\n\nWhat do I do now that I've exhausted every resource I have, from books to search engines to behavioral studies and everything in between?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"fantasyrelationships","subreddit_id":"t5_5778st","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/fantasyrelationships","subreddit_subscribers":2392,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"One of my co-workers has gotten a little... \"possessive\" of me, and I'd really appreciate some help in telling her to back off a touch.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.98,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/fantasyrelationships\/comments\/t3u7q7\/one_of_my_coworkers_has_gotten_a_little\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I was manager for a bit, but they knew I had gone back to school and couldn't work more than I was, and I told them I just I couldn't do as much as I think a full manager should anymore, but I really think they should find a manager. I said I could do the stuff I had been in the meantime, but not more things. It took like 7 months, but eventually someone offered to do it. It was one of the techs, but we all agreed any manager needs to be upfront too (the doctors know everything going on in the back, but not the front, and most of the administrative type stuff was reception based kind of.) Around that time, I asked the owner of the clinic, my boss, if she might be willing to write me a letter of recommendation for my school transferring, and I never saw it, but she said it was really nice.\n\nI got into the school of my dreams, which had been my hope all along, and everyone had known all along I wasn't sure if I would be able to work at all once I started there, but I let the new manager know again also. I spent a while at home learning spreadsheets to make up an interface for the new schedule that included everyone. I kept asking the new manager when he would have time to learn the reception stuff, and the other things I'd been doing that he probably should have picked up months ago. He was always too busy.\n\nI talked to him again a few weeks before school started, and let him know I needed to go down a bit more to only one day a week (I'd been gradually weaning down), and reminded him school was likely going to be hard and I likely wouldn't be able to stay on much longer. He said they were in a really tough position staffing-wise, and he still hadn't had a chance to learn anything, so couldn't I just stay on for one day a week for now, and if things got too crazy I could just take a couple weeks off? I REALLY wanted to leave on good terms, and figured it's just one day for a month or two.\n\nAnyway, fast forward a month and a half, and all the reception shifts have half the people they should, and he's being really rude to reception. I know I've got to get out soon, but I figure I'll talk to them about it during spring break, when I have more time to think about what I'm going to say so they wouldn't get mad (the manager had been firing anyone who put their two weeks in and basically making stuff up.) My boss and the manager wanted to talk to me, and I figured maybe somebody had made cupcakes for my birthday, (it was my birthday weekend.) They told me they were so disappointed in me for \"not caring\" even since I'd gotten a letter of recommendation from the boss for my new school (6 months ago and 3 months before she had written me a text telling me how much she appreciated everything I do) and they're letting me go and there's nothing else to say. I had wanted to leave so badly so I just said okay. The new manager never bothered to learn about the stuff I'd been doing for years. No one there knows how to do like 4 of the things that are pretty necessary every month. No one bothered to ask me the passwords to the emails I had created. I'm not going to help once they realize this though.\n\nI just don't get it. I'm the third person they've done something similar too. I'm 99.5% percent sure the manager has been blatantly lying to the owner, but she's known for being well... crazy, so telling her would accomplish no good anyway. It's just weird though because even the day they fired me, an hour before, the manager was sending people up to teach them how to do stuff he didn't know how to do so they could teach him. They both must have been able to surmise there are many other things that come up that they wouldn't know how to deal with. My family and friends have already expressed their disgust and are going to switch vets. If we had left on good terms, I would have been more than willing to help with whatever. It's so bizarre. Why not just let me leave when I wanted to? Why not let me know they are good now and I don't need to stay? It's just weird, and it hurts me personally.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"rant","subreddit_id":"t5_2qn2b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/rant","subreddit_subscribers":247977,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I'm So Frustrated I Was Treated So Badly By A Former Employer","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.75,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/rant\/comments\/t3uet7\/im_so_frustrated_i_was_treated_so_badly_by_a\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I guess I'll never understand why I'm feeling still unhappy and depressed for some reason.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"depression","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqqf","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/depression","subreddit_subscribers":870168,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I dont know","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/depression\/comments\/t3ueu7\/i_dont_know\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Maybe a collar if you decide it would be fun, but that doesn't qualify as clothing. I live here on your estate now, at your beck and call. I'll cook, clean, and provide any other \"services\" you require. The smile on your face as you said services sticks in my mind, the vague implications it holds sending a shiver through my bare body. From now on, I'm yours.\n\nI feel your hand slap across my bare backside, pushing me forward into a quick and stumbling walk. I head down the long hallway, your order echoing in my head as I move past the wall length windows. My bare feet slap across the cool marble floor, not even allowed the simple cover of shoes. I can feel your eyes burning into my back as I scamper off, knowing I'll do what you've requested. This is my life now, a nude servant with no option but to obey.

Thought something was wrong with me.  Thought I was ugly and felt like  a forever alone dude.  I recently went out to a vacation to re connect with an old friend.  He is a bartender and has a girlfriend, so they know lots of people.  Within the first 2 days, they had a girl over to meet me, I just talked to her like a regular person, like she was one of the boys.  She was super hot, we ended up making out at the beach and then she took me home and fucked me.  It required 0 effort from me other than showing up and being a regular person.  This snowballed into getting EVEN MORE attention from ladies, as once other girls see you with a pretty girl, your value shoots WAY up in their eyes.\n\nIf you are a dude sitting at home wondering what you are doing wrong, it is most likely that you just aren't getting in the right situations.  Having the social proof of other men and their girl friends liking you and vouching for you, is basically the best thing you can possibly have when it comes to getting women.\n\nGo out and do things you like to do, make friends.  You will start to feel natural, especially with age.  When I was 22, I would go out and be around girls, but I had so little experience, I would get so nervous and not even know what to say.  Just realize, IT DOESN'T fucking MATTER!!!!!  I am seriously a dork.  That's why girls like me!  I just embrace it and say silly shit that I would say to my bros,  I don't treat them any different.  I only realized all of this after being broken up with and going through a dark time where I didn't care about anything.  Once you literally do not give a single fuck, the women pick up on that.  It is pretty simple from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust some words from a former foreveralone depressed type dude who didn't even want to show my face in public, who now will go out to bars and literally have girls looking ME up and down, wanting to go home with ME.  I promise you, it can happen with you.  Disclosure I am 6'2\" and fit, so that might have some effect as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI forgot to add, for anyone that doubts that I'm a little dorky.  When she first made out with me, I was pretty drunk during the day at a beach bar with her.  I was joking around about the bar scene and about how I dont have tattoos like all the cool guys.  I was in her passenger seat and said \"no one ever accused me of being coool\"  in a kinda joking way.  She looked at me and said \"I bet not\"  then proceeded to get on top of me in the car and make out for a few minutes.   The whole point is that I didn't say anything cool.

I am a little embarrassed making this post so please forgive me for using a throwaway account.\n\nThis will probably be a weird read for most of you. It's a little weird for me to write because I've never talked about it to anyone -- it's kind of my deepest personal secret. I just hope people can keep an open mind and try not to jump to any assumptions about my fetish. I am mostly doing this because I'm really curious how those unfamiliar with it will respond, and whether or not I should continue to keep my twisted fantasies hidden from my boyfriend. If you're weirded out by this, I'd be curious to read your thoughts as well. \n\nFirst of all, I'm  29 and I've had these fantasies regularly since even before puberty, and it just naturally developed into something sexual over time. Thing is I am deeply obsessed with a fetish known as macrophilia. In short terms, it is a sexual fascination about giants and tiny people.  It is entirely rooted in fantasy. Exactly what the fantasy looks like varies from person to person. In my case the fantasy always revolves around being tiny or shrunken down to an impossibly small size and toyed with by a \"normal-sized\" guy. It would be more accurate to call my particular fetish microphilia, but the official definition doesn't  make that distinction. As you probably can imagine, there are numerous subcategories for what happens in this scenario, which I won't get into now. What makes this such a powerful fantasy for me is the extreme power-dynamic between a dominant giant and a completely submissive tiny person. To be at the mercy of a dominant partner is really what it's all about for me.\n\nSo where does my boyfriend come into this? I honestly have no clue. It's a completely unrealistic and personal fantasy. Maybe bondage is comparable, but looking at it online doesn't do anything for me. As it is I feel like my sex life is split in two right now. There is the sex I have with my boyfriend, and then there is this personal erotic fantasy-world which regrettably I have to say gives me a lot more sexual gratification than he does. I've told him repeatedly that I wish to explore more together, but he is incredibly vanilla and doesn't even do anal stuff because \"he'll just end up hurting me\".  He's my fist, so it's becoming increasingly frustrating. If he was willing to explore my sexuality with me, then maybe I'd be able to find something that tapped into this weird fantasy. If I revealed my fantasies to him it might make it easier, but I'm terrified that he'll misunderstand and think I've gone completely insane. \n\nIs it unfair to keep this side of me hidden?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"askgaybros","subreddit_id":"t5_2vgfw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/askgaybros","subreddit_subscribers":321628,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Should I be open to my BF about my bizarre fetish?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.67,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askgaybros\/comments\/t3ujfz\/should_i_be_open_to_my_bf_about_my_bizarre_fetish\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

My roommate at the time got a job in a different part of the state and essentially moved out, but left a lot of her stuff at the apartment. I was used to living with roommates and had never lived alone, so I think my mind started to wander. At first, I was just trying on her clothes and really liked how they felt... then I started buying my own clothes, and then makeup (although I really didn't know what I was doing). I told 2 girls who I was close with about it and they were completely supportive! One went shopping with me and helped me pick out a bunch of new clothes, and the other taught me how to apply makeup. I slept with both of them while I was dressed (and before then but that's besides the point), and I really never imagined that crossdressing would lead me anywhere else. At this point in my life I was approaching triple digits in the amount of women I'd slept with... I'm not physically attracted to men, so that thought didn't cross my mind for quite a while. And then... I got my first sex toy.\n\nI was dressing up so often since I was alone all the time that I was practically living in my apartment full time as a girl. When I started to feel how amazing the toy felt (it was a 7\" pink jelly dildo), I started wondering what it would be like with a man. I remember looking on Craigslist for a bit but was a little too sketched out by the situation and eventually gave up. And then, I got a job offer in a different state. This was my chance to maybe reinvent myself, in a place where NOBODY knew me at all.\n\nWhen I moved, I ended up having roommates again, which put a hamper on the amount of time I could dress (didn't really want them finding out). I got used to their work schedules though and learned the best times I could still do it. One day, I'm feeling particularly aroused while dressed... and I start talking to a guy online (I still can't remember what platform it was). He convinced me that he would show me a good time, and I caved and told him to come over. He finally shows up at my place, and my anxiety SKYROCKETED lol. I think he could sense I was nervous, as I had never done this before, and I didn't want my roommates to find out. I told him I'd never done anything like this before, and he pulled out his cock and said \"You should just go for it then.\" I start sucking his cock, and I found out that I truly enjoy giving head! That moment was so amazing to me it made it all worth it. We move to the bedroom, but I'm still super nervous about everything... My toy didn't make the journey with me to the new state so I hadn't been penetrated by anything in quite a while. He had some trouble slipping his cock inside in me, and then when it finally happened I think I was too nervous to enjoy the experience. I wish I hadn't been so nervous, because giving head was amazing, and even though he was wearing a condom I could feel when he came and it turned me on again (you know.. right when everything ends lol).\n\nA few years later (I won't get into why it took so long), I was dreaming about being with a man again... which, like I've mentioned before, is weird to me because I'm not attracted to men.  I met a couple on FetLife looking for a crossdresser to play with, and thought this is my opportunity! I hadn't gone out of the house dressed up and let them know that, and they told me it was totally cool if I came over and got ready first. I show up to their apartment with all my stuff, and they show me where I can get ready. I put my jeweled plug in first to get ready for the occasion, and then I applied all my makeup before putting on some really sexy red lingerie with cute bows. I came out of the bathroom wearing my heels (which is interesting to see considering I'm 6'3\") and they were both stunned at how sexy I looked. We move to the bedroom, and I get down on my knees and start sucking his dick. His gf meanwhile starts playing with my plug and I get INCREDIBLY turned on. She pulls the plug out and asks if I'm ready for him... this time I wasn't nervous at all and I was enjoying every second of it. He gets behind me, grabs my hips, and slowly enters... all while his gf is under me sucking my cock. Then her baby starts crying, and she apologizes and asks if it's ok if she leaves. I'm so into everything at this point I didn't care. Sure it was amazing with both of them, but the way he was fucking me felt incredible. I honestly thought I was going to cum from penetration alone (a feat I've only accomplished once with toys). Eventually, he wanted me to top...  I wasn't really into it but figured what the hell. He came pretty quickly then... I was still super turned on so I licked up all of his cum.\n\nAnd then the pandemic happened...

I am 14 now. To begin this story, the day this happened wasn't an unusual day. It started off like any other. I woke up, ate breakfast, and went to my friend's house (Not naming). We went around the neighborhood causing trouble, as always. Once we were done, we went to my backyard which was around 100 feet long. We played football, soccer, baseball, all that stuff. That's when my friend noticed something out of the corner of his eye. He quickly said, \"Hey, did you see that?\" I. of course, didn't see anything. I asked him what he was talking about, and that was when he pointed towards the woods. The woods he was pointing at always creeped me out. Since my family moved into our house, those woods have always gave me an eerie feeling when I get close to them. He then said, \"You thinking what I am thinking?\" I knew what he wanted to do. He wanted to explore the woods. He  then told me what he thought he saw was a tall black figure peeking out from behind a tree a couple hundred feet of trees away. I was hesitant at first, but soon agreed. We walked for about an hour in the woods but found nothing. We started to head back, but as soon as we turned our backs we heard a branch crack like someone was walking behind us. We immediately spun around but saw nothing. We were already kind of on edge about this whole situation so we started speed walking towards my backyard. We turned our backs again, every once in a while looking behind us. We made it back to my backyard safely, but before we headed to my house we looked behind us one last time. What I saw has scarred me to this day. Only maybe 100 feet away was a 8 foot tall creature looking at us from behind a tree. We were frozen in fear. Before we ran it did something out of my nightmares. It didn't care we were looking at it, and it swung it's gigantic arm out from behind the tree. It pointed and us and pointed back to the woods. It then ducked back behind the tree. We ran back to my house faster than we've ever ran before. I've never seen the creature again, nor have I gone into those woods again. Should I go back?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"mrballen","subreddit_id":"t5_2wjit9","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/mrballen","subreddit_subscribers":60209,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My Creepy Woods Story (Suggestion)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.75,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/mrballen\/comments\/t3v0ng\/my_creepy_woods_story_suggestion\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I've been getting less sleep every night, and I developed a headache, chest pain, chills, depression, anxiety, and a bunch of other generally unpleasant feelings I don't have great ways to describe or happen in the bathroom. \n\nMy pain is also coming back. I've been getting treatment for my pain that includes a chiropractor (who I previously regarded as charlatans), trigger point injections, and PT and had hoped some of it might have subsided. \n\nIt doesn't seem like pregabalin causes muscle and joint aches, but I'm anxious to know what the pain is going to be like once my other withdrawal symptoms are in check.

Dated a little but living in a cramped house with parents made it difficult and the degree I attained meant I wasn't focused on dating. \n\nNow that I'm 25 with said degree I can comfortably afford a decent home in my area. The trouble is... my parents. They are aging and nearing retirement. I've been with them for years now and have taken on things like taxes, medication management, fixing their diets, helping with insurance. Essentially being their assistants for anything aging people need help with. I took on a lot of these duties out of love and because I was able to live with them rent free. We've always been relatively poor and by doing this they gave me a way out which I'm grateful for. \n\nAnother catch: my parents' home is provided as part of one of their careers... When they retire soon, they will need to buy a home to retire to. \n\nPutting it all together - now that my parents are at that age, they are asking if I want to go in with them 50\/50 on a multigenerational style home where they can retire and I can still have enough space to start a family. I would be able to continue helping them this way. \n\nWe would ideally each have enough room to not bump into each other constantly, but would still be living under the same roof. The home would eventually be mine completely. Would be a large beautiful property. \n\nI guess I have a couple options: a multigenerational home with parents, or let my parents and I get houses separately? Both letting my parents retire nicely and starting a family are important to me. \n\nMy dating concerns - Is this a bad move... romantically? Like say I find a girl I have chemistry with... would she be bothered by having parents around? Would she be upset that we likely wouldn't be able to uproot and move somewhere else without paying it off?

As the title says, I'm a dominant guy with an all too innocent demeanor! Wouldn't quite believe I'd be able to bring myself to pin you down or trap you in your room until you've sucked me dry, huh? Well, best get to believing it because you'll almost undoubtedly be seeing it. I like being aggressive and creating a psychological space where you believe the things I say in that I will bite harder or I will punish you in some way if you don't obey my orders. For me it's all about the mental aspect of making my sub believe that I'll go through 100% with what I tell her I'll do to her. That's the main theme of any flirting, chatting, etc that I aim for when playing with subs. I'm mostly looking to chat or sext. If you're nearby and we hit it off enough then maybe something can come of it!\r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, I'll name a few things that I enjoy greatly outside of the mental intimidation:\r  \n\r\n\n* I love biting the neck and shoulders of my subs, leaving only a gentle mark when I'm done. I'm not looking to make you bruised but you'll certainly feel my teeth sink into you when I bite down.\r  \n\r\n* Any sort of pinning or entrapment. I love the thrill of a chase and capturing you, pinning you down or having you stuck in the corner of the room while I do with you as I please or make demands of what you will be doing for me.\r  \n\r\n* Licking. It's not a requirement by any means though I do enjoy the idea of tasting women, getting a feel for the natural skin care routine they may use and see if it tastes as good as it smells. It's another form of domination for me, indicating that you are under my control and subject to my whims.\r  \n\r\n* I love rowdy, disobedient subs that give me a reason to be rougher and dish out punishments. I still enjoy true submissives that will give in to my every command but there's something about a submissive that initiates the chase that really gets me going.\r  \n\r\n* I enjoy some forms of degrading. This is more likely if I'm in a specific mood or your enjoy it a great deal.\r  \n\r\n* On the flip side, I can also be a very loving and soft dom that will give praise and be gentler with you. Willing to take care of you but still have expectations on how you should act otherwise.\r  \n\r\n* That's all I can think of off the top of my head. There's definitely more and I'm sure you'll hear them should a conversation go on long enough!\r\n* I'll also say that I do have limits. The big ones being scat, gore, excessive torture\/pain, CNC (coercion is more what I enjoy), choking, and watersports.

I would like to start looking towards supporting myself and try living on my own. I currently hold an entry level IT related position in MB making 45k gross.

Most of my income goes to my savings (maxed out my tfsa contribution of 50k) and the rest sits in my chequing account (20k). I have about 1k in an indexed ETF but this was mostly me just testing the waters of other investment options. I am debt free and my goal is to own a home\/condo by the time I am 30. I would like to also own a vehicle for transportation but not sure if it is something I can afford (all I would need it for is to get to point a to point b).

So back to the story I had a very bad nightmare about an old man chasseing me around the floor crawling on all 4's I woke up almost crying so I went into my mom's room and asked to sleep in her room mind you this is like 2 3 in the morning and my mom's boyfriend at the time was sleeping so my mom said that I could sleep on the floor. So, I did and after about 5 10 min later I turned over to see glowing eyes looking at me and I thought it was my cat because it had cat like eye's but then I realized that the eyes were under my mom's seater chest and my cats at the time were fat so they could not fit in this little crack in the floor and the eye were glowing like when you get flash banged in cod but the black little slits in the eye is what made me think it was my cat. So, I get scared, and I tell my mom and she said that it was the cat, but I knew that it was not, but I managed to fall asleep but when I woke up, I said I would never sleep on her floor again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStory 2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis happened to me a year ago, so we moved and were still in quarantine at this time, so I was doing online school also my Granma still lived with me at this time, so it was a regular night showered, brushed teeth and went to bed. Then in the middle of the night I thought someone was shaking me awake so I thought it was my grandma, so I said what Granma then the shaking stopped then a couple seconds later I started getting pulled by my arm off my bed, so I jumped awake and turned on my phone flashlight and was like wtf just happened so after that I told my dad and my dad's side of the family are all catholic, so when I told my dad about this he told my grandpo and he gave me holy water and stuff to bless my room so I did and nothing bad has happened in a while but I have nightmare of someone just standing at my door way and just looks at me sleep and sometimes my door will open randomly and I have been having sleeping problems but when I go to my dad's it all goes away and I sleep fine so I have no clue what happened here to make such an evil thing want to mess with me.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BeingScaredStories","subreddit_id":"t5_4kig6l","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BeingScaredStories","subreddit_subscribers":1287,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Two scary stories","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BeingScaredStories\/comments\/t3vdnf\/two_scary_stories\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I think i was 13 years old at that time. And I used to be obsessed with it. I didn't really want to be a boy at first. I just imagined myself as a guy whenever i had sexual fantasies. At that time i used to dress and act feminine and it didn't really give me dysphoria.\n\nNow I'm 18 and the last time i wore a skirt\/dress and put on makeup was 2 years ago i think. I get dysphoria when i try to dress feminine. I've also pretty much lost interest in yaoi. The thought of bottoming for a guy makes me feel like a woman. So now i almost always imagine myself as a cis straight man (even in non sexual situations) it makes me feel better. But the thing is I have no interest in women\nI want a girlfriend because it would make me feel like a man, not because i am interested in her. I dont know if i am still attracted to men, I would never date or have sex with a guy because then I'd have to be the girl in the relationship. And also I hate being dominated.\n\nI dont know what to do. I don't want to live as a woman for the rest of my life.\nThw funny thing is if i didn't have access to internet at that age and if i didn't have an absent father i wouldn't end like this. I would be a normal cis girl like all of my friends. but it is too late. constantly browsing 4chan isn't helping either.

I handed it to her, told her it was hot, and she asked where the icing was. I sprinted back into the kitchen with socks on for extra boost, and made the icing really quick.

Saved up enough to buy my current place. For mental health reasons, I had to leave that job and take a paycut to about 130 (gross) but did not sufficiently adjust my lifestyle. Between eating out, shopping addiction, etc, I've racked up about 60k in debt. I'm so stupid. I did take a higher paying job in january (170k gross) and am able to pay my credit card minimums, student loans, and mortgage every month, but I feel this debt pressing on me and I'm paying so much in interest every month.\n\nOne solution is available that I know really isn't recommended- I have 68k in retirement. I'm 35 with no kids and expect to move upwards from my current salary. I also work at a startup and in about 5-6 years if we IPO as expected, I could be collecting 500k-1m depending on how we do, so there's a reasonable chance I could re-up my retirement after that. Obviously, my existing retirement money is actually there, and the IPO is all speculative. I have pretty solid job security, even if I need to move to another company just based on my particular education and field.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't stop thinking of doing one of two things- either taking 20k out of my retirement and paying off my highest interest credit card, or taking the whole damn thing and just starting fresh. I've been good at budgeting and have gotten my spending under control but it's just so emotionally heavy. I'm rambling, but I felt like I had to share this somehow and here seemed the best place to vent my shame.
