How good are you? \nNo, I do not need help when I am SSing. I would like to consider my self a decent screensharer. The only thing I cannot find is Demon which I've heard is easy to find but I've not looking into it that much.\n\nWhy do you want to be staff on our server? \nI would like to be staff on RealHCF for multiple reasons. The first reason I want to be staff is because I want to help out the community to the best of my ability. The second reason I want to be staff on RealHCF is so that I can help out the other staff members.. such as with ssing, what I think should happen in a certain situation, etc. The final reason I am going to be listing is so that I can help grow the server, If you do not know I am a youtuber and my best videos are my staff series. I have been hoping to get a good server to do a staff series on again. I know this portion doesn't have much infomation, I accidentally combinded both this portion and \"Why should we pick you to be staff on RealHCF\" portion because I didn't see this portion until after I made the \"Why should we pick you to be staff on RealHCF\"\n\nHow are you better than the other applicants?\nI believe that I can bring loads of talents to the server. If I see someone that needs help, I will immediately go to do that if I am not already preoccupied with another player. I'm good at just offering basic support or answering questions, and I will ask the help of a higher-up staff if I am unsure of myself with anything to do with the server (as I'm new to it, since it is just now revamping). Although I'm able to make up for it with my screen sharing, and better judgment to decide whether a player I am watching is hacking or not, I've rarely falsely banned anyone in the past, and I would strive to make sure everyone I ban is hacking. Another reason I am applying on RealHCF is that I want to make an impact on the community. If I am given a staff rank I am going to try to strive to make the experience of every single one of the players better. One way I am able to do that is by helping in TeamSpeak almost all of the time I am on the server. Another way I can do that is by helping in game. I am looking to help the server grow and develop, also not only helping the server grow and develop but by the server also helping me grow and develop as a staff member. I have been playing HCF since before it was popular. I have been in the community for about 2 1/2 to 3 years. With that said I can honestly say that I have seen good and bad staff and what not to do when I am staff. I have also been mentored by a couple of actual good staff that use to be on Arson. Both of the notable staff members names is Emotionill and Shaaf, Emotionill was a great help in both me becoming a better staff member and also a better person. Shaaf was also a big help in me becoming a better staff member, not so much a better person.I believe that my willingness to help is what really sets me away from most of the other applicants. I am very vocal and if needed I can step up to the plate and help lead to the best of my abilities. Being that if I do get accepted I will be placed as a trial-moderator I will not be able to do much then but if I am fortunate enough to move up the ranking system I would be more than happy to prove and show off my leadership skill/talent. I believe that the experiences that I have had being staff helped me become a better staff member. The experiences I have had helped me learn a lot of things. One of the main things I have learned throughout my time being staff in the HCF community is screen sharing. Screensharing I believe is the most crucial part of being a staff member, because if you do not know much about screen sharing then you more than likely will not be able to find ghost clients such as Vape, etc. Confidence is a big talent/skill is confidence. If your confidence in a server or just your confidence in your ability to moderate and fulfill your ranks duties is low you will probably not be the best staff member. It may also lead to abusing your powers or being inactive. Speaking of that, I would like to believe that I have a high confidence in both the server and my moderation skills.Another talent of mine is my respectfulness. In my eyes, I believe that I am very respectful to both players and staff members. I do not create grudges against players or staff members. I also respect both players and staff members ideas and concerns.In my opinion, I am a very chill person. I do not get mad or frustrated easy. When someone that is frustrated comes in TeamSpeak looking for help, I keep calm and try to help to the best of my abilities. If I can not help the player I will try to get a staff member that has the permissions and is able to help! I have a really respected value which is patience, patience is very important in being a great staff member. Patience is needed in certain situations or scenarios. For example, if a player is misunderstanding what you are saying, I try to help and not give up at least until the player understands. Even if I have to go more and more in-depth until he understands. One of my main skills that I can bring to the server is my maturity. I believe that I have developed a good maturity over my almost 16 years of living. I am not toxic in chat or TeamSpeak, and I believe that person's maturity is one of the biggest factors for a staff member. I do not make harmful jokes to any players or staff members. Sometimes I like to play a joke, however, I do think about the joke before I do it, therefore it will not be harmful to the server.\n\nDoes anyone else have access to your Mineman account? Could or would they possibly leak the information for pay? Would you?:\n No, no one else has access to my account.\n\nDo you have skype? (Only put it here if you're accepted, but at least tell us yes or no.) \nYes, I do have skype but I prefer skype or discord.\n\nDo you have teamspeak and discord? Both are REQUIRED. \nYes, I have both teamspeak and discord.\n\nHow old are you?\nI am currently 15 years old, but I will be turning 16 in december\n\nAnything we should know? \nWell, Hi my name is Parker. As you can tell from my application I am 15 years of age. I am also a youtube rank on the network currently, and I am looking to take my talents to a server and help them out by staffing and recording staff series.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"RealHCF","subreddit_id":"t5_3ni0m","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Pxrker's Staff Application","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/RealHCF/comments/6xav4l/pxrkers_staff_application/","whitelist_status":null}

I feel really confused and ashamed at the way that I've been carrying on recently. I've done so much stupid shit whilst drunk. I tried to jump out the window of my apartment last year. I want to get this under control before it becomes an even bigger issue.\n\nI guess I'm just venting, but do you guys have any advice for me? I'd really appreciate it.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stopdrinking","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7yr","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I think my drinking is becoming a problem.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6xaw0u/i_think_my_drinking_is_becoming_a_problem/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

My first time was really painful and I think I tore but I didn't think to actually take a look to see how bad it was since I figured my first time was supposed to hurt. Fast forward to now, 2 years later, and I still can't have sex without tearing at the opening of my vagina and bleeding, no matter what we try to do to keep it from happening. My boyfriend is slightly larger than average but nothing overly huge, and I'm pretty small. However, every source I've found says that the vagina should be able to stretch to accommodate any size if it is properly prepared. \n\nI am always lubricated enough and we have tried all sorts of different lubes but nothing stops the tearing. We always have tons of foreplay and he uses a finger inside first which normally does not feel uncomfortable, but anything more than 1 finger starts to hurt. The tear always occurs right inside of the opening of my vagina and I can feel it tear right as he first enters me. While I've always had stinging pain after sex, I didn't always used to bleed. The bleeding is always only a small amount and comes from the small tears I get, and it started happening every time we did it about a year ago. The pain from the tears can last a few days and it's especially uncomfortable when I pee.\n\nI've gone to my doctor a few times now and at first the only answer I got was \"it will stretch out eventually\", but this was almost a year ago. I recently went back and was tested for bacterial overgrowth and yeast as these can cause tearing, but these were negative. My doctor also did a colposcopy (looking at the tissue under a microscope), but I was nervous to let her look inside my vagina because the speculum is really uncomfortable for me and I tense up, however my tissue does not tear with the speculum, I only do with sex. So she only looked at the tissue at the opening of my vagina and it looked normal, but she prescribed me clobetasol, a topical steroid, to try and rule out lichen sclerosis. I used this for 10 days and then was told to have sex to see if I still had tearing, which I did and it did not help at all. The next step she said is to have a biopsy of the skin to see if it is lichen sclerosis but where I do not have any of the other signs of LS, I do not want to do the biopsy until I've tried absolutely everything else.\n\nI'm so extremely frustrated by this and it is making me never want to have sex. My boyfriend is so loving and understanding about it but I feel like a complete freak because I can't just be normal and have sex like every other girl. I've found other forums where people with similar issues have been diagnosed with vaginismus, however I have never had a problem with inserting tampons or anything else. I do feel like I'm maybe always a little tense down there though because even when my tampons are saturated, I've always had trouble pulling them out because it feels stuck in there. I'm also on Junel birth control and I am wondering if maybe that could be causing tearing. Another thing that seems like a stretch, is endometriosis. However, I've had an intravaginal ultrasound before that came back normal and I'm not sure if that's something that would have been abnormal if i did have endometriosis. Before birth control, I used to have EXTREMELY heavy periods and I still get really bad cramps. I also get shooting pains through my rectum which I believe is related to endometriosis in some people. I have another doctor's appointment in about a week with a new doctor so I'm just looking for ideas to bring up to her to see if she can find out why this tearing is happening. \n\nIf anyone else has this same problem or has found a way to fix it pleeeaseee help this is taking over my life and I'm scared it will someday ruin my relationship or keep me from ever having sex again.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"sex","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3p","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Tearing and Bleeding with Sex, NOT a Lubrication Problem","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/6xawd8/tearing_and_bleeding_with_sex_not_a_lubrication/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult"}

I am Returned Missionary though I came home early because of Anxiety Disorder, but honestly it was because I was scared and lazy and didn't want to do the whole mission thing once I got into the mission field.  I grew up in a part member family.  Dad was Lutheran, mom is a member but not the stereotypical LDS mom.  I am a father of a new baby boy.  Barely 2 months old and want to raise him right and teach him what he should know.  My wife is also a non-member. )\n\nOkay, so as the post suggests I am a long time Mormon.  I have been a member my whole life and went to church every Sunday.  My father was not a member for meany years and was recently baptized after I moved out of the house.  A few years later my mom and him got Sealed with my brother and I in the Nashville Temple.  However both my parents now don't wear their garments or have a desire to follow the teachings of the temple.  Needless to say my family is not a good source of inspiration sometimes. \n\nI love my family with all my heart.  However, I feel like I was not disciplined well to follow the teachings of the Gospel.  I am not even sure God even exists...I fear death and the idea of not existing.  I want to follow the Light of Christ, I want it to be real, but I am like Thomas and doubt it all.  Church history is not all rainbows and butterfly kisses.  Joseph Smith committed treason, whether it was for a righteous cause it shakes my faith in his authority.  Undoubtedly Prophets aren't perfect but something like that shouldn't be happening especially since gospel teachings tell us to follow the law of the land.  \n\nThat said...I married a non-member woman, she is great, kind, gentle soul, i have a longing to be sealed to her but then I doubt if God exists and say why bother.   I have a new son barely 2 months old and want to take him to church but at the same time don't want to lie to him and I don't want to do the same thing to him that happened to me.  I know this sounds awfully confusing, but i am looking for any evidence of the validity of this church and the Book of Mormon.   \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**With 1 Related Comments...**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Author** - 0ne_of_many\r\n\r\n**Posted On** - Thu Aug 31 14:56:57 EDT 2017\r\n\t\t\r\n**Score (as of Thu Aug 31 20:13:52 EDT 2017)** - 0\r\n\t\t\r\n**Body** - [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/6x4zzj/i_have_lost_my_faithtestimony_i_know_the_path_but/dme1gre)\r\n\r\nHah nah you just haven't met any ex-JW's. All kidding aside, my belief is it depends on how you, as a person, feel about it. We decide to have faith in things, and so if the LDS church is, to you, a good influence on your life, then you can choose to believe it. If you decide that it isn't, then you should choose not to. So, examine carefully the influence it has had on your life, your relationships, and the teachings you agree and disagree with.

There's been times where I took week or month breaks but that's it.

He tried it once when he was 18 and his heart stopped. Thank goodness he was taken to the hospital right away and was taken care of. Maybe him being allergic has an affect on me? \n\nEverytime I smoke, it becomes a lot harder to talk. I forget things incredibly easily (pretty sure I have short term memory loss, I always had a bad memory even before I started smoking) and I stutter my words a lot. And don't even get me started with girls. If I am smoking with a girl I like or atleast a little interested in, I am just completely silent. I sit there and think of things to say but I feel stupid because the silence has already been going for a while and i feel like it will make it even more awkward with just saying something random. \n\nIdk why this happens, but a few girls have lost interest in me because I just have a hard time talking to them. Maybe they just weren't right for me because we didn't have a lot in common, but I can't even fucking talk. I'm just overall a blank slate when I smoke and I hate it, but my mind wanders freely when I'm high and I have more motivation. I would stop smoking but I don't really have a reason to. I just do I because it's fun and it makes me feel better. Idek know what to do I feel like smoking all through high school made me a different person than I would've been if I didn't smoke. I feel less confident, I get incredibly self-conscious too. \n\nIs there anyone else out there like this? Any tips for me?

I'm 18, she's two years younger than me. She's all pissed up and coming back from a party and turns out she lost her virginity and she's all eeee and happy about it. Me? I'm a kissless, hugless virgin. Absolutely no fucker wants to go near me.\n\nI have depression. Big whoop. I'm suicidal. Even bigger whoop. I have severe body image issues and anxiety. Just a great person aren't I? The stock answer is 'oh but' - seriously, let me stop you there. I *try* to make myself normal. Honestly. I don't look like a hunchback, I would say I look ok. I'm not amazing, I'm not a fucking model, but considering absolutely nobody has done so much as *touch* me in the 18 dismal years of my life makes me think I'm missing some huge flaw, somewhere, and I can't see it.\n\nSchool was dreadful for me. I made some friends and lost nearly all of them either because they just suddenly decided I wasn't cool enough for them anymore or they moved and I lost contact. Sure, the few friends I had I valued above everything and they helped my depression but.... nobody, ever, once, invited me to a party. I was the social outcast. Bullied for 5 years, called every name under the sun, threatened to be 'put in hospital', had my name chanted at me by a whole sport class on a field, alone (that was *really* fun and I totally don't get bad anxiety hearing my own god damn name now).\n\nMy friend is fucking flawless. I've only gotten to know her in the past couple years but, she's one of the most funny, creative, understanding and relatable people I know. I watched her get into a relationship, but I couldn't be happy for her. I have no idea why. I have issues with *being happy* for people. I don't think I've ever been happy *for* someone. I either feel a mix of burning jealousy, envy or I just suddenly compare myself to them and become depressed.\n\nCase in point, tonight. Friend messages me saying she's lost her virginity and she's coming back from a party. Ok, sure, she's a bit worried cos she didn't use protection but like, there's various remedies for that.\n\nI felt absolutely no happiness *for* her. I wanted to be her, have everything she has, because clearly she's got her shit in check to get with someone and go to parties and oh yeah, she gets amazing fucking grades too so like, she beats me on every score. Looks stunning, thinks stunningly, has stunning things happen to her. And she just, walks it all off cos it happens every day. Zero hardships. When she tells me about something crap happening I'm already thinking like, shit - what is it? Someone in the family ill? She's feeling really down? But then it's something like - 'I only got an A when I wanted an A*'. Like, how flawless do you have to be to the point where something already astoundingly fucking amazing isn't good enough for you? And you have to go one step further?\n\nOh also this fucking ridiculous thing happened recently, didn't want to tell my parents about suicidal thoughts etc. so kept it hidden, but I told all my friends. I found out, *the day before*, that they fucking schemed to send a letter - behind my back - to my mum basically telling her about it. **'for me'**. I'm glad I found out, but then they essentially blackmailed me into telling her the next night. She took it well but, she's clearly worried. I don't want the treatment because it sounds horrible and it sounds like it takes ages and ages, plus I saw a friend relapse really bad off meds and I don't want to have that myself. Plus I have a phobia of medication. I know - pitiful fucking human right? I'm a genuine, pitiful piece of shit.\n\nBut the main thing here is that, I'm literally *that* fucking pathetic. Nobody has kissed me, nobody has hugged me. Certainly haven't had sex with anyone. I'm about to go to university - place of, popular people, people who have got it all, people who aced high school and went to all the parties and fucked all the guys - and I go alone, depressed, suicidal, having absolutely none of those things happen to me, and I have to wing it and pretend to be a different person.\n\nOh god yeah, fucking work. Managed to get a job this summer and I fucking hate it. It's these, 4 hour shifts. But I'm convinced time stops there. It's the most - monotonous, dreary job ever and it lasts for so fucking long. Especially if I do something wrong too and get picked up for it, then my anxiety skyrockets and I can't hold a fucking pen straight for 5 minutes, and then I'm on the brink of tears for the next couple hours too. I'm that fragile and that weak. Which makes it no wonder - to be honest - why nobody wants to even go near me. Jesus, look at him, can't even take criticism without crying, the fuck is wrong with him.\n\nAnd then everyone always goes, 'oh ok but what do you do? like hobbies-wise?'. and then i tell them.\n\n*fucking everything*\n\nIt might be out of desperation, to be noticed, i don't know. I fucking,\n\n* Play piano\n* Do art\n* Produce music (electronic stuff)\n* Write (books / poetry)\n* Do programming (what I'm studying at uni)\n\nand *desperately*, honestly - *desperately* look after my friends and check in on them, ask them how I am, and in turn when I feel terrible I go back to them and tell them and they also help me back. But at the end of the day nobody loves me, still.\n\nAlso - fuck that old saying of 'money can't buy you happiness'. Money *does*, and absolutely **can** buy you happiness. I'm a poor kid from a single family who went to a private school on a 95% bursary. I watched kids constantly fucking happy cos Daddy bought them the latest apple phone and they're going to Magaluf next week and they have top-range cars and their parents are still together and they don't get bullied and they go to parties and have all the booze and sex and weed they want cos they're rich.\n\nOne of my friends has the same dream as me, producing electronic music. We both do it. We've done it for years.\n\nHe's hitting the big time with his stuff *because he can buy it*. If you talked to him he'd tell you it's cos he's self-made and he did everything himself - but it's bullshit. His parents are both top-ranking medical professionals. He's loaded. He can get any equipment he wants, any music pack, any VST, any vocalist, any promotion, any gig. Anything. He just flashes the cash and he's in. And then has the nerve to tell me I 'give up too quickly'. No - I keep giving up (Which i don't tbh, I spend most of my day making music because it keeps me alive) because nobody listens to my stuff compared to him, I've only ever had 1 gig and that was as a support act (it was still an amazing night though, one of the best of my life and I thank the main guy for putting it together) and I'm not Mr. fucking Popular at school so nobody had heard of me there.\n\nOh shit yeah I remember the other big point, I've lied to this amazing flawless friend of mine. About being a virgin. As far as she's concerned I've hooked up before and, *Ohh yeah done all sorts and it's easy and happens all the time*. And I can't bring myself to tell her the truth because it's so embarrassing and life-ruining. *Jesus i'm 2 years younger and i've gotten with way more people than you*. How sad does that sound?\n\nHonestly I'm *this* close to just kicking a stool cos I'm sick of it. I tried, honestly. Did all this shit, tried to be a popular, talented person, and ended up with mental disorders, no social life and desperate suicidal tendencies. Here's to me wanting to hang from the ceiling ASAP. Just need to get to uni first.\n\nFucking kill me.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"rant","subreddit_id":"t5_2qn2b","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I am honestly *this* close to offing myself.

I'm Morgan. I enjoy writing prompts and RPing, so needless to say, I have a whole bunch of prompts stuffed away somewhere. \n\nThis post is simply my way of saying I want to do anything I can write now. I always reply to people who get in contact with me, even if it is a polite, \"No.\"\n\nFeel free to use these prompts for your own need if you like them in the future. (Don't worry, I'm giving you full permission.)\n\nAnway, read and enjoy, the prompts will be numbered for ease of access as well as labeled with a basic set of kinks. They can add or take away aspects as we see fit, but that's all up to you.\n\n1. **(Twincest, possible ageplay)** We are twins, stuck at home for the holidays. (We can either be high school sophomores at our parent's house or college kids sharing a dorm) We are generally very comfortable being around each other, we are usually naked in the house unless there are people over. Lately, we've taken to teasing each other. An ass grab here, a cleavage tease there. It's become our own little game...\n\n2. **(Incest, transformation/minor bimbofication, ageplay)** We are part of an experiment. When I was 6 and you were 3, our parents gave us to this company for testing. Every day we take an addictive (albeit effective) pill that is supposed to force us to go through puberty early. It worked, a little too well. Our sexual parts grew out of control, and our libido went through the roof. I am 13 now, you are 10. We are excused from any kind of school and we have people who the company sends to our rooms every morning to Fuck for the day how we feel fit. They have to rotate the people out though, because sometimes we are just too much for people to handle. Besides, my 18 inch cock and almost volley ball sized balls, and your 36HH boobs usually suffocate people. Our rooms reek of sex. We met every week a couple of times and there is a window between our rooms so we can watch what the other does. We have never fucked each other though, but today, the company decides to lift the window between us.\n\n3. (Same as above, but we live with our parents and they decide to leave us alone.)\n\n4. **(strangers, teasing)** this one is pretty straightforward, we met on a train years ago and every day we tease each other a bit. Today, I finally decide to talk to you. (We can either play out the teasing scenes, or start right from the sex.)\n\n5. **(Incest)** You are my little sister. We go on road trips all the time and are very close. We love eachother company and usually share a kiss or two on our trips. But this time, I'm single. So I might take it a bit further. (Con, dub-con or non-con, up to you)\n\n6. **(Incest, sexual world, rping multiple people, ageplay, orgy etc.)** The entire world is sex crazed. We are brother and sister and both in our lower teens. After the settlers reached America, the only hope they had was sex... A lot of it. Flash forward to today. Rather than the America we all know and love, it is simply a sex crazed society, bent on giving and receiving one thing: sex. (This one is pretty technical, but is hella fun)\n\n7. **(public play, ageplay)** You are my girlfriend's little sister (I'm a senior in high school so you could be a freshman or sophomore) I take your sister to the movies one day and your parents say that you have to go with me. Little does your sister know that we were planning something while in the dark theatre, your sister on one side, you on the other. (This one could lead to a threesome if you wish)\n\n8. **(age play, public play, teasing)** We have been best friends for life, literally. Our parents met in the hospital when we were born and they have done everything together, forcing us to do everything together. We are freshman in highschool now, and we changed our schedules to be perfectly the same. We decided last week that we would try something interesting. We would tease each other in the middle of our classes. Besides, we always jokingly tease each other anyway, so why not in class? What's the worst that can happen? (This can be twincest too if you wish)\n\n9. **(Incest, sleep play)** I am always sneaking into your room in the middle of the night, thinking you didn't know, but of course you did. You caught me once and realized what I was doing, so you fake sleeping every night, just so I can sneak in and do things to you. Last month I took off your clothes, so now you sleep in the nude. I wonder what you would do if I put my cock in your mouth.\n\n10. **(Ageplay, growth)** I am your best friend and we have been for almost our entire lives. I have had a condition that I have failed to tell you about. As I get hornier, my parts grow. One time, it got so out of hand that it took a day and a half to get it back down to normal size. (This can be incest and my cock can grow as much as you want)\n\n11. **(Ageplay, Age regression, Cum Play)** I have magical cum. Anybody who becomes showered in it, becomes younger. I have become well known in the world over the last 473 years. I almost never age a day. Most of the time, people in their 40 Somethings come to me just to give me a blow-n-go, with a good payment of course. You, however, are different to me. There is something about you that... interests me. You are in your mid twenties right now, sitting at the bar. You don't know who I am, and I don't know who you are, but little do we know we are both the same. (Basically, we both have the same ability, both have kept ourselves young over the years. We both look in our twenty-somethings but when we both get together, we start to get younger every day. This is probably long-term)\n\n12. **(Ageplay, Babysitter, Possible incest)** I am either your brother or an old friend of your family's. You are somewhere between 4-7. Your mother called me up to tell me that she'd be out on business for a week and she needed someone to watch you. I gladly obliged. (This will work very similarly to the game Babysitting Cream, You start a little uncomfortable and I have to make you more comfortable in order to make you mine. Definitely Long Term!)\n\n13. **(Ageplay, incest)** You are my little sister and I am your chaperone on a field trip to the botanical gardens. As we are walking around, we seem to get separated from the group.\n\n14. **(Ageplay, incest, Precocious)** I'm a senior in HS, you're my little sister, an innocent K-6th grader whose body matured way to fast for her mind to keep up with. Today is a holiday for us, but not our parents, they still have to work today.\n\n15. **(Free use, Possible Ageplay/Incest)** Welcome to the world of sex. It's just like our world, but every single thing in the world has been turned into something sexual. Money is Sex. Dates are Sex. Family Bonding is sex. Sex is EVERYTHING and EVERYWHERE. (I just want to paint a picture with you, share everyone's stories. I want to jump around and tell the stories of everyone in this world. Requires multitasking sometimes and playing all kinds of people. Not for the feint-hearted)\n\n16. **(Ageplay, Over mature Girl)** You are a girl in your single digits who just happens to be very knowledgeable about sex. Every guy you see, on the streets or otherwise is another target for you to learn more about the wonderful thing called Sex. (I would play multiple people during this one. Whether at the same time or at different times is all up to you of course)\n\n17. **(Twincest, Possible Orgy)** We are twins and have been close, nay inseparable since birth. Tonight is our Senior Prom. finally, we are almost done with it all. Now it's the end of the night and we have 2 choices. Go home with a few friends of ours, or spend the night just us two. (Either direction works in this case, so it's up to your discretion)\n\n18. **(Babysitter, Ageplay)** You are in your single digits. I met you and your mother on a run one day a few months ago and have met every day since. Your mother has just informed me that she has an out of state meeting for the next week, and she needs me to babysit. (Basic Babysitter prompt, up to you how to carry it out.)\n\n19. **(Casual Sex, Dystopia)** It finally happened. The world is finally at peace all thanks to the International Power Act. Mankind now has the freedom to do anything, anywhere, at any time. Many of those opposed to the law thought that murder would be happening left and right, but something completely different happened. (Obviously, lots of sex)\n\n20. **(Incest, Ageplay)** I am a senior in High School about to graduate and have my own life. You are my younger sibling who I have basically taken care of since birth. I've bathed you, fed you, clothed you, entertained you, taught you, and honestly been the only parent figure to you (Since Dad is a huge drunkard and Mom is a Drug Addict). A friend of mine recently told me that I could take my family out to her family's cabin on a large lake. Seeing as how our parents aren't really in the business of... being parents, I decided to just take you for the week.\n\n21. **(Precocious Puberty, Age Play, minor Dubcon, Possible Incest)** You are in your Lower single digits (3-7) and you have a condition which has forced you to undergo Puberty at a very young age. By this time, you have developed fairly large Breasts, a well shaped ass, and you started your periods around the age of 2. You have the body of a pornstar, but the innocence of a preschooler. Who am I? That's up to you. Am I your older brother who decides to teach you the ropes? Your high school buddy who was assigned to help you with school, but helps you with your body instead? Or am I some complete stranger who decides to manipulate your innocence? You decide.\n\n22. **(Harem, Minor Control, Ageplay)** I was born like this. Though I didn't start discovering it until recently. I got a job and I thought it was just coincidence. I would ask a person if they wanted to buy some crappy item, like I was told to, and every single time, they did. Once I noticed it, I started to experiment. I went to my boss and asked for a 2 Dollar Raise. She gave it to me on the spot. One time I went down town and told a woman to walk around topless the rest of the day. I still have her shirt and bra. I have always had a thing for the little girls who come with their parents. Maybe I can be a bit more persuasive... (I would like to end up having many girls at my beck and call. But how this plays out is up to you.)\n\n23. **(Ageplay, Incest)** You caught us once, and you've never stopped thinking about it. Your older sister, underneath me, making loud noises. You didn't know what it was at the time, but you loved it. You have always wanted me, I know. And I secretly have always wanted you. So are you going to take advantage of the situation? (I can either be your brother or your sister's boyfriend. Either way can lead to just us or a treesome, all up to you of course)\n\n24. **(Ageplay, possible incest)** Fairly straightforward. You and I hook up this summer during a 6 week summer camp. This is fairly long term. I would prefer to play with me as a high schooler and you a bit younger than me if possible.\n\n25. **(Anything Goes, Virtual Reality)** Congratulations! You were one of 100 people in the World chosen to do BETA testing on the new Epsilon Virtual Reality Helmet (EVR). Since it's announcement years ago, you have been watching it's progress closely. And you jumped on the signups for BETA testing. Lo and Behold, you got it. A note arrived with it. \"Your imagination is the limit with an EVR. If you can think it, you can play it. So your wildest dreams will come true. Enjoy\" (Feel free to make of this what you will.)\n\n26. **(Creepy)** Do you have any weird kinks that you wouldn't tell even those closest to you?\nFor instance, does the thought of tiny bugs crawling across your body and chills down your spine (in a good way ;)? Or would you rather have a monster rise from the sewer, dripping and oozing as it takes your tiny body. Do you like the thought of tentacles, beats, bugs, and monsters? (Any and all kinks are fair game in this one)\n\n27. **(Ageplay, School)** Does your child show signs of young whoring? Would your child rather draw pictures of cocks than of rainbows and sunshine? Is your child going to grow up to be a slut like every other little girl like her? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you should send your child to the Monster School for the Young! In case you didn't know before. The world of the supernatural, of fantasy, of monsters is real! Most of it though, is kept in a school for teaching little whores. All ages are accepted, but the younger the better! Does your child have a knack for lots of long, slimy tentacles? We have classes for that! Does your child think, \"the bigger, the better\"? We have classes with orcs and giants! (And by giant, we mean enormous!) How about a bunch of tiny pixies violating her body? Gnomes with sharp hats? Vampires that can't help but bite their students? Enroll Now! (Long story short, I will make your schedule and run your fucked up classes in order to teach you exactly how little girls are supposed to act.)\n\n28. **(Incest, Virus, Possible Transformation)** You are my little sister. We decided to go to an island instead. But little did we know that after we got there, they would pull up the draw bridge. A virus was recently released. It doesn't affect women, but it makes guys insatiably horny. And what's worse, the virus evolves. (Basically, this virus can do whatever it wants to me, and it will, in turn change how I am talking advantage of you. Alternatively, it can affect both women and men. I would prefer if you played in the single digits for this one.)\n\n29. **(Incest)** Happy Birthday! I've decided to take you anywhere you want to go for your birthday! Anywhere in the world and I'll take you there. What kind of fun will happen there? (Either I can force myself on you, or you can find some way to thank me. Or really this can even go in a romantic direction if you want.)\n\n30. **(Incest, Freeuseish?)** Our parents surprised us with a trip to a resort. The only problem is, it's a couples' resort. We have to pose as a couple for the whole week. That means sleep in the same bed, take part in the couples only activities, and play all of the couple's games. (This is going to grow increasingly more awkward. I wouldn't mind having us be twins for this one if you dont want to have a huge age gap. This one is a bit more long term, but it can be short term if you so wish.)\n\n31. **(Creepy, Anything Goes, CYOA?)** You've always been told to never take a single step into the woods. Your parents always warned you about the dangers of it. Despite their constant warnings, you wanted to anyway. You might regret it, but you might find more enjoyable things. (I'll base what you find off your kinks, but I've had some fun with this one before)\n\n32. **(Creepy)** Your house has always had a bug problem. Your daddy tried to get rid of them, but they are resilient, they never leave you alone. You're sure you can feel them crawling all over you when you go to bed. Feel them going up and down your legs. Who knows what lift happen when mommy and daddy have to leave for work. (This one is pretty self-explanatory. The bugs are going to have their way with little, helpless you. This can either go short term, or long term, both work.)\n\n33. **(Ageplay, Fantasy, Harem, Mind Control?)** The world was a happy place full of peace. Everyone enjoyed their life and lived in harmony with nature. All of that changed when the darkness decended on the earth. Nobody knew where it came from, but it affected everyone. Taking away everyone's libido, it left people depressed and unable to enjoy sex. Everyone but me. For some reason, I am unaffected by the darkness, and what's more, Whoever I fuck is restored to their former glory. (Not for the faint of heart. This takes a lot of work on your part and I'm just warning you now. We would both create a world together and my character would conquer it and restore it to glory with.... well... sex. This one takes a bit of talking about, but if you would like to do it and are willing to do it, it can become a lot of fun.)\n\n34. **(Ageplay, Gangbang, Orgy)** The newest game show has just come out! American Slut is a show where any woman or girl has their chance to be the next multimillion dollar porn star! The basic premise is they are locked in a room with an almost unlimited supply of (well hung) men for a week. What happens after that is up to the producers. All the girl has to do to get out is press the red button. Do you have what it takes to make it to the end. (This one can be really simple or super depraved. The only limits on this are your imagination. You can play any age, though I prefer if you were young.)\n\n35. **(Ageplay, Creepy)** Welcome to the carnival! I'm sure you'll have fun, just take a look around. There are little girls of all shapes and sizes all enjoying their time while their parents go off on their own. Maybe head over to the games where the carnies will test your might against their own cocks. Or head over to the food where you get all the cum covered treats your heart desires. Maybe take a few rides, you can even ride the bigger ones no matter what your size! Check out the Petting zoo. The animals are eager to play with your tiny body. We even have a funhouse, but who knows what you'll find in there, or if you'll ever get out when you enter.\n\n36. **(Twincest, Ageplay, cute?)** You and I have always been the closest twins, doing everything together. The same soccer team, the same music, the same food. Everything. I've we start to hit puberty, though, things get a bit more awkward for us.\n\n37. **(Superheroes, Ageplay, Long Term)** Welcome to super power camp for the young! You all have your own superpowers whether you realize it or not! Everybody here is between the ages of 4 and 12 and will be staying with us for 9 long weeks while we develop your powers and the powers of those around you! Please keep in mind that there will be no using your powers for evil or devious acts unless you are told to. Please report to your dorms and you will be inspected shortly. Enjoy your stay! (If you do this one, please tell me your super power and whether or not your character is aware of it yet.)\n\n38. **(Ageplay, cumplay, anything goes)** Ah, Oktoberfest. Never ending beer, German music, and hot German babes. But what if, instead of beer it was all cum. And instead of music it was monsters of all sorts. And instead of German babes, it was all little girls. You are one of those girls. Becoming addicted to cum, drinking it by the pint. Going to the many events around the festival. Tentacles at 9am, Bugs at 11, beasts and horses at 2, transformation at 4, Futa showdown at 7 and many many many more!. But every night ends with one big orgy where all the creatures come together and have their way with all of the girls.\n\n39. **(Ageplay, Possible incest, dreams)** We are connected in interesting ways. Something seems to have happened and for some reason we are dreaming the same dreams. Every night we find ourselves interacting in our dreams, both lucid of course. How will our dreams affect the way we see eachother in real life? (This one can be super fun. We are either brother/sister, best friends, or complete strangers who end up meeting because of these dreams. This world can become our own until we wake up.)\n\nThere you have it! 39 Prompts all rolled into one post. I hope you enjoy reading through them.

As the title says, I'm a trans girl living in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. There isn't really a lot of dating opportunities up here so I've decided looking around to see what there is on here wouldn't be too terrible an idea.\n\nA little about me: I'm 5'6\", have brown hair and eyes, and I'm roughly 208 lbs. I wear glasses and I'm also hearing impaired. I'm an introvert and I (probably) have anxiety and depression. I say probably because I've never been diagnosed but looking them up online seems to describe the way I feel a lot. I really enjoy playing video games, reading, and watching movies and TV shows. Here's a [picture](http://imgur.com/a/evXIn) to give you a basic idea of what I look like.\n\nAbout my transition: I'm currently just looking the part (no hrt or anything else) and I'm unsure whether that will change.\nI'm looking for a long-term relationship; I'm not looking to be someone's RP fantasy or a sex object. I'm looking mostly to try dating a guy, but I'm open to dating just about anyone. I say \"try\" dating because I've never dated one before and would like to see what that's like.\n\nAs far as some games I like to play, I like ARPGs a lot. So I enjoy stuff like Path of Exile and Diablo 3. I also enjoy my fair share of modded Minecraft. I'm into all kinds of music but I don't really like EDM. I find I enjoy a lot of movies, perhaps more than the average person. I'll generally watch just about anything. So, that's pretty much a tl;dr about me.

I have posted here before but with little success. I am looking for a long term relationship. Not just as friends, though I hope to start out as friends. I want someone to be there for me as I will be there for them. So, a little about me then. I'm 6'2, with blue eyes, short faded hair, a little paler than I should be, and an in shape body. No I'm not a model but I do take care of myself. I have been going to the gym more recently and I'm dedicated to improving myself. I have also begun to eat healthier. I like to maintain an active lifestyle by running, hiking, swimming, and working out. I also like to stay inside and watch movies, read novels, and play video games. I have a career and I'm financially stable. I have an old vehicle but it's in good condition and I intend to keep it that way. I'm looking for someone who shares similar interests really. Interests and values at least. No liers or cheaters. I'm not saying you have to be a copy of me though. But, I would like to connect on some level. I don't really care for appearances.  But, I do find someone that takes care of themselves to be attractive. I might be considered ugly, IDK they say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. So, I don't mind what your face looks like or what color skin you have. I also don't mind where you live as long as you can meet up one day. I would prefer somewhere around my age as we would be able to connect better so like 18-26 I would also prefer you have your life in hand, or at least getting back on track.

I'm 18, she's two years younger than me. She's all pissed up and coming back from a party and turns out she lost her virginity and she's all eeee and happy about it. Me? I'm a kissless, hugless virgin. Absolutely no fucker wants to go near me.\n\nI have depression. Big whoop. I'm suicidal. Even bigger whoop. I have severe body image issues and anxiety. Just a great person aren't I? The stock answer is 'oh but' - seriously, let me stop you there. I *try* to make myself normal. Honestly. I don't look like a hunchback, I would say I look ok. I'm not amazing, I'm not a fucking model, but considering absolutely nobody has done so much as *touch* me in the 18 dismal years of my life makes me think I'm missing some huge flaw, somewhere, and I can't see it.\n\nSchool was dreadful for me. I made some friends and lost nearly all of them either because they just suddenly decided I wasn't cool enough for them anymore or they moved and I lost contact. Sure, the few friends I had I valued above everything and they helped my depression but.... nobody, ever, once, invited me to a party. I was the social outcast. Bullied for 5 years, called every name under the sun, threatened to be 'put in hospital', had my name chanted at me by a whole sport class on a field, alone (that was *really* fun and I totally don't get bad anxiety hearing my own god damn name now).\n\nMy friend is fucking flawless. I've only gotten to know her in the past couple years but, she's one of the most funny, creative, understanding and relatable people I know. I watched her get into a relationship, but I couldn't be happy for her. I have no idea why. I have issues with *being happy* for people. I don't think I've ever been happy *for* someone. I either feel a mix of burning jealousy, envy or I just suddenly compare myself to them and become depressed.\n\nCase in point, tonight. Friend messages me saying she's lost her virginity and she's coming back from a party. Ok, sure, she's a bit worried cos she didn't use protection but like, there's various remedies for that.\n\nI felt absolutely no happiness *for* her. I wanted to be her, have everything she has, because clearly she's got her shit in check to get with someone and go to parties and oh yeah, she gets amazing fucking grades too so like, she beats me on every score. Looks stunning, thinks stunningly, has stunning things happen to her. And she just, walks it all off cos it happens every day. Zero hardships. When she tells me about something crap happening I'm already thinking like, shit - what is it? Someone in the family ill? She's feeling really down? But then it's something like - 'I only got an A when I wanted an A*'. Like, how flawless do you have to be to the point where something already astoundingly fucking amazing isn't good enough for you? And you have to go one step further?\n\nOh also this fucking ridiculous thing happened recently, didn't want to tell my parents about suicidal thoughts etc. so kept it hidden, but I told all my friends. I found out, *the day before*, that they fucking schemed to send a letter - behind my back - to my mum basically telling her about it. **'for me'**. I'm glad I found out, but then they essentially blackmailed me into telling her the next night. She took it well but, she's clearly worried. I don't want the treatment because it sounds horrible and it sounds like it takes ages and ages, plus I saw a friend relapse really bad off meds and I don't want to have that myself. Plus I have a phobia of medication. I know - pitiful fucking human right? I'm a genuine, pitiful piece of shit.\n\nBut the main thing here is that, I'm literally *that* fucking pathetic. Nobody has kissed me, nobody has hugged me. Certainly haven't had sex with anyone. I'm about to go to university - place of, popular people, people who have got it all, people who aced high school and went to all the parties and fucked all the guys - and I go alone, depressed, suicidal, having absolutely none of those things happen to me, and I have to wing it and pretend to be a different person.\n\nOh god yeah, fucking work. Managed to get a job this summer and I fucking hate it. It's these, 4 hour shifts. But I'm convinced time stops there. It's the most - monotonous, dreary job ever and it lasts for so fucking long. Especially if I do something wrong too and get picked up for it, then my anxiety skyrockets and I can't hold a fucking pen straight for 5 minutes, and then I'm on the brink of tears for the next couple hours too. I'm that fragile and that weak. Which makes it no wonder - to be honest - why nobody wants to even go near me. Jesus, look at him, can't even take criticism without crying, the fuck is wrong with him.\n\nAnd then everyone always goes, 'oh ok but what do you do? like hobbies-wise?'. and then i tell them.\n\n*fucking everything*\n\nIt might be out of desperation, to be noticed, i don't know. I fucking,\n\n* Play piano\n* Do art\n* Produce music (electronic stuff)\n* Write (books / poetry)\n* Do programming (what I'm studying at uni)\n\nand *desperately*, honestly - *desperately* look after my friends and check in on them, ask them how I am, and in turn when I feel terrible I go back to them and tell them and they also help me back. But at the end of the day nobody loves me, still.\n\nAlso - fuck that old saying of 'money can't buy you happiness'. Money *does*, and absolutely **can** buy you happiness. I'm a poor kid from a single family who went to a private school on a 95% bursary. I watched kids constantly fucking happy cos Daddy bought them the latest apple phone and they're going to Magaluf next week and they have top-range cars and their parents are still together and they don't get bullied and they go to parties and have all the booze and sex and weed they want cos they're rich.\n\nOne of my friends has the same dream as me, producing electronic music. We both do it. We've done it for years.\n\nHe's hitting the big time with his stuff *because he can buy it*. If you talked to him he'd tell you it's cos he's self-made and he did everything himself - but it's bullshit. His parents are both top-ranking medical professionals. He's loaded. He can get any equipment he wants, any music pack, any VST, any vocalist, any promotion, any gig. Anything. He just flashes the cash and he's in. And then has the nerve to tell me I 'give up too quickly'. No - I keep giving up (Which i don't tbh, I spend most of my day making music because it keeps me alive) because nobody listens to my stuff compared to him, I've only ever had 1 gig and that was as a support act (it was still an amazing night though, one of the best of my life and I thank the main guy for putting it together) and I'm not Mr. fucking Popular at school so nobody had heard of me there.\n\nOh shit yeah I remember the other big point, I've lied to this amazing flawless friend of mine. About being a virgin. As far as she's concerned I've hooked up before and, *Ohh yeah done all sorts and it's easy and happens all the time*. And I can't bring myself to tell her the truth because it's so embarrassing and life-ruining. *Jesus i'm 2 years younger and i've gotten with way more people than you*. How sad does that sound?\n\nHonestly I'm *this* close to just kicking a stool cos I'm sick of it. I tried, honestly. Did all this shit, tried to be a popular, talented person, and ended up with mental disorders, no social life and desperate suicidal tendencies. Here's to me wanting to hang from the ceiling ASAP. Just need to get to uni first.\n\nFucking kill me.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SuicideWatch","subreddit_id":"t5_2qpzs","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Planned my suicide for yesterday, made a big thing of 'turning it around and telling my parents about it instead' but now wish I was dead and still fucking hate myself","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6xb7rw/planned_my_suicide_for_yesterday_made_a_big_thing/","whitelist_status":"no_ads"}

In all of them, without any arousal or orgasmic feeling. The first time I do admit we put a little too much tongue and held it too long; the second time, when I realised we were kissing too much, I stopped and went to caress her opposite cheek, causing my arm to rest over her boob, and it made me cum; the third time was today.

This time though, we made out a little and I stopped in \"prevention\", tucking her head in my neck. Then the feeling began growing even though we weren't even kissing anymore, I tried and tried to make it go away, I tried talking, pretended to look out of the window to see if there was traffic behind us, but it was no use.\n\nIn all these times there was no \"orgasm\" or extreme arousal, hell, I've felt arousal and that wasn't it.

I'm just wondering if the smoke will hurt me a lot. Will it affect my running?\n\nI have a grinder with a screen. However I haven't really noticed that much kief. It's a very tiny amount.

Alcohol I could just buy a pack of hurricanes for 6 bucks. Can't really buy any weed for 6 bucks can you? I mean, if I bought 6 bucks worth of weed, it would barely be anything, right? I buy a half for 120 and it lasts only a month or so.\n\nIf my neighbors smell the smoke from outside, can they call the cops and the cops can search my house or something? \n\nI know this sounds silly. But how on earth can alcohol be legal while weed isn't? Alcohol has made me gained a TON of weight. And it has caused problems. I mean, people DIE from alcohol. So I really don't get that. My aunt is an alcoholic. It bothers me how this horrible evil liquid can be legal while weed is illegal. \n\nMy mom is sort of okay with me drinking alcohol. But just REFUSES to accept weed.

Is it WRONG to offer some to my mother? I'm 23 and just started smoking last year. I always stayed away from drugs and alcohol cause my mom said it was bad. I don't know. Then my one cool friend got me into it. Now it's changed my view on things.\n\nI'm in college right now, been sober for a week and I feel fine without weed. I really do miss it. But like, it's no big deal, you know? I made sure not to bring it to campus. However my room mate brings it inside my room and smokes it through a gravity bong. Turns on the fan, puts on incense, opens the windows, and covers the smoke alarm. Says there is no risk at all.\n\nI'm just scared of getting caught. If my roommate get's caught with weed, will I get in trouble too? Can't I just say I had no idea or something? How the hell would be my fault if he is smoking and bringing weed into my room without me knowing, you know?\n\nCan't I let my buddy smoke when I'm not there or something? And let him run the risk and not me? \n\nI've never had friends growing up. So when I was filling out the paperwork for a roommate, I asked for a room mate who smoked cigarettes. And what do you know, my room mate smokes and drinks and parties mad hard. He goes to a ton of parties on campus and smokes and drinks.\n\nI REALLY want to have fun and live a little. Go to parties for once. Would it be horribly risky to go party with him and smoke? I'm scared of getting caught and ruining my entire life and getting kicked out of college when I have come so far.

So a bit of background, and then we'll get to my question.\n\nMy parents smoked cigarettes while I was growing up, although they were fully aware of the health hazards. So aware, in fact, that I think the quantity of genuine threats of punishment I got from them regarding me smoking *anything* far outnumbered any other fear-of-reprisal warnings they made. There were a couple things that were *major* problems for them, and the coffin nails were a big one. \n\nThis meant that the concept of smoking anything was anathema for me for a long time. Never, EVER touched marijuana until I was in my mid/late 20's. I did then, because I started having panic attacks after a bad experience (My apartment ceiling pipes burst in the middle of winter - all my stuff - poof). Anyway. A friend suggested weed and benzos. So I started both. I'm sure some of you have, or know people who have benzo stories. Long story short, I'm off them now. \n\nThe weed though - I've been off and on for years. I'm 35 now. The last 2 years have been overwhelmingly stressful. And in order to slow things down and focus on the important stuff, and to take time to rinse the stress out, I started up again about a year ago. With it being legal (here) now, and readily available, it made sense to give it a go again, and steer clear of the benzos and ADs. So I did, and it's working as expected again. I'm more focuses, less stressed, no panic attacks, and I have a pretty clear idea of what I want to achieve next.\n\nQUESTION TIME:\n\nIn order to minimize the health issues, I got myself an Arizer Extreme Q a few months ago. Good purchase in terms of my lungs. However, I notice I am burning through my grass. I went through 1/4 on the weekend. I keep it at 199F, and use the whip until the herb is the color of coffee grounds, and I get nothing else - but I feel like the high I get vs. the amount of grass I use is WAY off. 1/4 use to last me a couple weeks. So - am I doing something wrong? Should I take a T-break?

People are so bored these days-- I really need someone to hear me out completely and really, really hear me. You are my people. Now, I am 41-- I have been out into the world and come back full circle, and I have stories to tell.\n\nI have led a life that at times--including now-- seem like a movie. I am presently dating a beautiful 26 year old(equally crazy infp, who is the dark mirror of my infp ex-wife). My last girlfriend was a hot 30 year old PHD candidate, former ballet dancer with whom I had a passionate, deep relationship with, and manage to remain congenial--she's a redditor. I might ask her to join,. Oh yeah, AFTER we broke up, she became a bisexual stripper. I guess it's all in the timing.\n\nI figured I'd lead out with my amazing catches-- even my first wife and I had a lovely 13 years in many ways, until I understood how MBTI really can be used as a window to crack open the universe. \n\nIt's...just missing a few key ingredients, and I think we are near to put these things together--I think it's foolish to think it hasn't already been done.\n\nBut, as we all have extroverted intuition, I need \"YES, AND\" type of collaborators who can understand me in my native tongue. That would be you.\n\nMy child is 15, and also a Redditor, but he stays internet anonymous. I work in commercial production at a local news station, but have no official interaction with the news department. \nSo it's like being an extra in an alternate universe Aaron Sorkin show.\n\nI make random cultural references because they are a kind of key to the reader to help it (are we inevitably going to use 'it' there.. holy shit, that movie is opening&lt;thoughtspiral&gt;\n\n--my new girlfriend.. HOT girlfriend just texted.. but man, is it a weird story.\n\nBut not as weird as the fact that I will (have) probably be(en) the deciding factor in whether or not my school shooter gets paroled.\n\nYes, that's right, I was in a school shooting 9 years before columbine. I've always been an early adopter-- I had a Treo 600--the first real smartphone 4 years before the iPhone. But there's something super dark about the legacy of being 9 years ahead of the curve on columbine.\n\nNot only that he's black, one of just a few in the tiny christian southern baptist school we attended, where we were in the same algebra class and a bully named jake called him niggerlips.. because 1988 in Virginia.\n\nWhat's even weirder was that when I was a kid, I went to gradeschool at a southern gospel black private school in Harlem, where I was one of the only white kids--I'm half rust belt Jew and half Birmingham Alabama southern belle who moved from new york to virginia when I was 9 so he could work for a televangelist named pat robertson, where I saw the rise of the right wing christian evangelicals from the ground floor.\n\nI talked to edward snowden last year, and the question was prescient and he dodged my question. This is an amazing fucking story that nobody seems to get. I think you can.\n\nOh, did I mention my school shooter is 1 hour away from Charlottesville in prison?\n\nRight after I got the job at the media outlet for which I work, I asked the head editor (I am also an editor, amongst other things) if I could see the footage from the day of my school footage. They kept it in the 'morgue.'\n\nTurns out she was the one who shot it, and there it was again, in living color.\n\nAnd then they did a story on it for the news part of the media outlet. And then it turned into a bit of a series, that I no longer have a part of.\n\nAnd then the commissioner of the parole board of virginia asked to speak to me, based on the article I wrote, and my TV interview.\n\nThere's a real chance for parole.\n\nBy the way, he was barely 16 when he brought his gun to school.\n\nIt runs straight through religion, guns, politics, race...\n\nAnd I also had a paper route from the time I was 13, read the news, skipped a grade, graduated high school at 16, taught myself 3D starting 3 years before Toy Story 1 came out, taught a community college class when I was 21 and younger than every student there.\n\nI directed a musical.\n\nI worked for generals, ceos, I played poker with James Woods and Ashley Madison, and then I was compromised in the AshleyMadison.com scandal.  Good thing I was already divorced and had been blogging about my infidelities.\n\nIt was weird when I asked Snowden about it-- and asked him essentially if we lived in a world with \"Too Many Secrets.\" He dodged the question and started talking about encryption, which is silly when you think about it, because there are so many holes in security and human stupidity that no secret is truly ever safe in the digital realm.\n\nThe weirdest thing is that during the runup to the Electoral College, the guy to stand up to say he was going to be a faithless Trump Elector, he was immediately destroyed by being outed by the Ashley Madison hack which was happening at the time of his divorce.\n\nJust like the guy who asked about energy in the debates.\n\nWhy was the most important question turned into a joke where we jumped after the controversy instead of the question?\n\nMy question is this: Will you honestly consider changing one of your most deeply held beliefs? Will you consider changing all of them? That's not to say you'll have to change any of them-- but if there's any hope at all for our species we'll need to understand one thing--the most important thing.\n\nIf you are entering into a negotiation unwilling to give up your most important 'ask' then you cannot expect that of the other party.\n\nYou must level the playing field.\n\nThere is no future for a species who refuses the ability to change their minds--effectively being reborn.

I have a small penis and I feel like my quality of life is very poor and damaged. I have dealt with self-esteem issues my entire life, but now that I'm 18 and I realize that my penis will never grow the issues have been exacerbated. If you met me in person you would probably never guess I have these issues, because I cover it up by being the typical masculine guy who is competitive, aggressive, self-assured, and looks people in the eyes. However, I am a virgin, and I have a small penis. No matter how much confidence I have around women, I know the situation can't go anywhere because they will see my penis and end it or not enjoy the sex. It kills me inside knowing that I can't please a woman with my penis, and I feel like I was cheated out of a shot at a solid life. This has damaged me beyond repair, and I think I can't go on anymore. I feel like I am trapped in a hole I can't get out of, and I feel like I will be here for the rest of my waking days. Another thing is, I feel very angry and bitter about it. When women try to be nice to me or smile I brush them off and give them dirty looks. Like aggressive \"what the fuck do you want from me\" type looks. If I had a bigger penis, I would approach them with the charm and assertiveness that I have with interacting with other men, but I can't. Again, because I know I can't fully experience a sexual encounter and take the situation to it's fullest capacity. I know my issue isn't due to low T, because I can grow a beard just fine and I'm very hairy. To top it off I was bullied when I was younger which made me very anti-social and bold. I was ostracized for the majority of my days alive, and now that I developed the tenacity and gall to face that and end it, what do I get? A small penis?

This time though, we made out a little and I stopped in \"prevention\", tucking her head in my neck. Then the feeling began growing even though we weren't even kissing anymore, I tried and tried to make it go away, I tried talking, pretended to look out of the window to see if there was traffic behind us, but it was no use.\n\nIn all these times there was no \"orgasm\" or extreme arousal, hell, I've felt arousal and that wasn't it.

I never expected him to act so unsupportive.  He was so upset when i told him, and became angry when i said i didnt know if i wanted an abortion.  Well i ended up having a medical abortion this week at 7weeks. It was very painful,  and emotionally traumatizing. He has been calling and texting to see how i am doing. But I'm so angry. Angry at myself mostly,  and him. I have noone to go to, because I'm so scared of being judged.  My parents are very prolife, and would be devastated. My friends would be disappointed,  because i am an adult, i have a decent job, and i could've made this work. I cant blame him, and say he pressured me. I just feel like im not in high school,  i couldve taken responsibility for what i did. Every time i see a baby or pregnant woman i cringe.  Its a reminder. Im sorry this post is so long.

I've tried exercising, melatonin, velarian, theanine, tryptophan, magnesium (topical for better absorption) and can sleep for about 5 hours and then I'm wide awake. I have no stresses in my life. Carbs enable me to sleep. I can have a piece of low carb bread or a carrot while on Keto (within 20g carbs) and be knocked out like a light. Something to do with serotonin production. I might try Dave ausprey's honey before bed trick keeping it below 30/40 grams of net carbs. Being non-Keto = restorative/normal sleep. Even 40g net carbs is not enough for me to fully sleep through out the night,\n\n- I'm hungry all the time. I've gone from 55g of protein with fat to satiety to limited fat and 120g protein for satiation (20g net carbs). Nothing.  I've even gone zero carbs. But if I binge on carbs the next day I'm full. I would have thought 2 weeks was enough to semi-regulate hunger. \n\n-no energy. I'll be in bed all day for 15 days because keto has given me no energy. And it just isn't sustainable when I need to do stuff around the house. \n\nFor now, I'm non-Keto and exercising.  But I still want to give Keto a chance, even after 8 months.

It came on out of nowhere and since then has made my life very difficult. I've seen a multitude of specialty doctors-cardiologist, gastroenterologist &amp; a pulmonary doctor could find no cause. I've been treated with high doses of prednisone , ibuprofen and muscle relaxers , none of which seem to help. Ultimately I ended up seeing a psychologist at the advisement of the other doctors. The psychologist ended up prescribing xanex which I only rarely take if I'm having trouble sleeping. The tightness is worse when I'm laying down. I have suffered from anxiety off and on over the years and tend to be a pretty tense person. When this came on, my sales job was very stressful, we were struggling financially and my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 liver disease. I'd also like to note that I was working out regularly doing the elliptical and weights for months prior to the onset to help control stress. I'm not sure if this helped or contributed to the problem. I've never been able to get a solid diagnosis other than the obvious anxiety and stress. I've come to the conclusion that I've stressed myself out so greatly that I've caused damage to my chest cartilage. The sensation is quite tight but my chest is not sore to the touch... so I'm told it's not chostrochondritis although my symptoms seem quite similar. Things have greatly improved in my personal life over the past 6 months or so ( new job, my mom is doing well) however,  the chest tightness lingers and seems to be aggravated by even the slightest exercise. Just when I think it's improving it comes back. I'm 35 year old female , 5'6, 160 lbs, work FT, married with kids and this is really screwing up my life. I'm relatively healthy , don't smoke. Have tried yoga, acupuncture, chiropractor &amp; life changes to no avail. Would appreciate any thoughts or comments.

Although many points on the criteria doesn't fit me especially now, and even felt like my processing/seeing the world has changed a lot that I feel more connected to NT in many ways.\n\nEven with a diagnosis, I was never actually treated. Or that I found any treatment helpful. I was moved to a special ed class as more of a means to separate me from normal students. But it did prevent me from learning proper social skills.

I started smoking weed when I was 12. Than tried spice a year later. Got deep into that, even started making my own spice. Starting taking prescription opoids. Got into Research chemicals. Mostly Etizolam. Then I found out about Xanax when I was 18. That's when my drug use spiraled out of control. I burned a lot of bridges and ended me up in jail a few times. Most recently I've started using Meth. I vowed never to try that drug because I've heard a lot of bad things about it and I never wanted to labeled a tweaker. My uncle ended up in the hospital from an overdose from it when I was 10 and I remember my family talking about it. \n\nThe first month I tried it, I only used it for work. Like one little line a couple inches long before work. Than I started hanging out with the tweakers and I started smoking it. Man I was going through a gram in a day when it would have lasted me a week if I continued using it the way I was. I got into debt with my drug dealer. I was getting fronts and when my paycheck came I would go buy some ice from someone else. It was fucking up my work life. I knew everyone knew I was coming to work high and smoking in the bathroom. It was uncomfortable but I said fuck it who cares what they think. \n\nI was staying up for days. The longest was 5 days with no power naps. Man that took a toll on my body I know. I'd smoke and in an hour everyone would noticed how tired I was. I was smoking more than my drug dealer. He showed me how to hit the pipe properly and get huge hits. But I still was hitting the pipe every hour. That rush unlike anything. The best feeling in the world. I'm sober now. Well not exactly but I no longer part take in meth. \n\nBut back to the topic in question. I tried to quit all drugs when I was 17. I was on probation at this time. I was clean for 12 months at least. But the cravings in my head for something, anything, never went away. I spent most of that year locked up in my room. I only left to use the bathroom and go to the kitchen. Then some time after probation was completed I got back into smoking weed, taking xanax, and started smoking cigarettes. I have not been on something since then. I'm 21 now. I'd love to hear your journey into sobriety!

I know the chances of this happening are slim, it just worries me that if it happens, the consequences would likely be severe due to the remote location.

Much like dating, I have to \"click\" with someone to be their friend. I don't want to go out the bar and drink every weekend but just once in a while. I don't want to have couple dates all the time. Sometimes I need girl time to go shopping or complain about my significant other. I've put myself out there many times in my life with little success. \n\nI have one good guy friend but he's fairly busy and isn't big into texting or whatever. We have a lot of things in common and really click. I am just worried I annoy him and there is some...tension between us. Despite this, I consider him my only friend and my best friend I just don't think he thinks the same. \n\nI don't have hobbies to speak of beyond Reddit and YouTube (which aren't social hobbies). I don't have a desire to do anything social since most people bring friends to those types of hobbies and I would t have anyone to bring. It would be just like school all over again where nobody wanted to hang out with me/choose me for their team. I also have some very firm viewpoints (on social/political issues) that I won't hesitate to let ruin a friendship.\n\nI have a boyfriend and many exes so I am not a complete recluse.\n\nAt this point, with so many failed friendships and literally one person i consider a friend, I'm wondering if I'm only tolerable if sex is involved. I've spoken to many people IRL and they just say \"put yourself out there\" and \"get some hobbies\".\n\nMy heart hurts so much and I'm so lonely and so tired of being friendless. I can't talk myself into \"I'm better off without friends\" any more.\n\nTL;DR I am a weird little friendless bean throwing a bit of a pity party right now. I could really use some positivity and help.

My girlfriend and I know each other for a year and been dating for 8 months, and the struggle is already *so* tough, I can't imagine what waiting like more 8 years would be like! Sometimes I think of getting married as soon as we both graduate in college, which is 2020, I'll be 25 and she'll be 23. \n\nSo many couples date for 3-4 years and break up like it's nothing, some pepople marry after 6, 8 years of dating, most aged around 28, 30...

I am Jack and I am 5'11, slim and In decent shape too I guess. My hair is a dark blonde and my eyes are blue. My cock grows to around 6.5 inches when fully erect.\n\nI started fantasising about older women nearly two years ago but recently the urges have become stronger and the fantasies have been wild. I'm a virgin and would just love to have some fun with a naughty, dirty older woman on here who knows exactly how to please a guy and his cock.... I would learn so much and be blown away by your skill...\n\nI will admit it, i simply love older women who are hungry for young cock, from the women I have spoke to in the past, its definitely the ones who simply love having a young body to play with that are the most fun so if you simply adore young guys, love the fact that you're a kinky cougar and arent ashamed to admit it then bonus points for you! One of the things i love about older women is their experience, they've mostly seen it all and done it all before and know just how to drive a young guy insane, if I was to be lucky enough to be with one then they'd give me standards that no one could live up to around my age.\n\nSome of my kinks include: Blowjobs, older women, being seduced, ass, anal, face sitting, spanking, lots of cum, dirty talk and women with experience. However, I would love to explore more and learn more about the things that get my teen dick so hard....\n\nI am open to most things and am happy to either chat or roleplay! A few ideas for roles if you wanted to roleplay are:\n\nYou are my mother's best friend.\n\nWe are neighbours.\n\nYou are my mom ;)\n\nWe meet at a hotel bar and we hit it off.\n\nYou don't have to pick any of those, I am open to other ideas! If we are to roleplay then I would find it hot if you knew that I was a virgin and really loved younger guys and felt like having some fun with me.\n\nI hope to hear from someone soon!

I'm 21 she's 20. Both in different colleges. I have had some issues and went to a therapist. But I'm all good now. I thought I had anger management but I didn't. \n\nOnwards ; I've been with this girl for a while and we keep fighting and fighting. And it's always over the dumbest things. If she doesn't something and I get upset and she sees it, she gets mad at me for being upset. If I do something, we'll forget about it. It's like a killed someone. She makes such a big deal. I get girls can overreact. I get that, but she gives me this vibe now where if it ain't all perfect. She's upset. If one day I'm not being lovey dovey im being mean. Like what? She busts my balls and it's fine I bust hers and I'm bullying her... what? It gets better. Every time we drink , she pushes me away. As in physically says \"leave me alone get away from me\" as I'm whipping her puke up. I've created fights. But I feel she get bored and does them herself. This weekend. I said I might come late Friday night. Maybe. Depends if I have to do work at home the next day. She starts crying. \n\nShe had a terrible child hood, she was abused by her parents. Her mother is bipolar. Oh and I forget, she has yet to introduce me to them....her father doesn't know about me. Because apparently he is really strict. \n\nMore ... all summer we were supposed to hang out. She has 2 months off. And we saw each other 4 times. We live 25 mins away. She doesn't drive, she would claim she needed rest days. Or days to clean her room (which she didn't do until the day before she left ). \nI say all that because I read one of those signs of bipolar and that's one of them. She can't finish a job she starts and has days where she doesn't feel well. She can't drive cause it stresses her out, she doesn't feel comfortable. But all these things add up. Like I get it. As a human we need mental days. I work and go to school. Maybe once a month I get a mental day. Maybe?  But my off days I go and see her. I see my girl atleast 8 days a month. I drive to see her at school. \n\nI work my hardest to make her happy and when things aren't like Romeo and Juliet. She has breakdowns and she plays the game \"blame boyfriend \" for example. I have this fantasy league. She doesn't know football. But I said hey let's ask her. I asked her 3 times. She said maybe. I made the league without her. She throws a fit saying she gonna kill herself. \n\nWhat do I do? I've said she needs to see someone. But she won't. She said she got tested to see if she was bipolar. And she wasn't. But I really think she is. How do I get her to get seek help. \n\nWhat do I do so im not miserable? I do love her but I can't marry a person who makes me feel like this.
