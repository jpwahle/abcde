But she is so damn stubborn and doesn't realize that a lot can change in 8 months. She told me she wants and NEEDS me to be with her, so why doesn't she let me? \n\nAfter our unofficial break up last night, I sent her a message on Facebook, keeping things simple and not begging for her back. Simply put; I told her that she's going to regret throwing away the one person she's ever emotionally loved, that she'll need me more then she thinks. I'm trying to get it through to her that if we love each other, then we need to BE with each other. Because if we give up everything we've gone through, if we give up our love now, we'll both go on in life questioning if we made a huge mistake.

She plans to keep touch with all her friends and family once she leaves, but since I'm the most important one in her life, I get the 'pleasure' of being shut out. And it's just so unfair how she THINKS she needs to terminate me, because we're madly in love.\n\nI can't go another 8 months, seeing her almost every third day and not being able to be with her.

I feel so betrayed, and I feel as though my love and confidence got lost with her.\n\nShe replied to my Facebook message, hinting that she may have made a huge mistake and that it doesn't feel right to throw the one person she loves under the bus so she can move away without any guilt. We talked about long-distance.

Wait a week in torment? Should I plead more to her to convince her it's a mistake? Or do I let her have her space, and hope she takes me back and gives me a chance?\n\nI can't lose this girl. No one else has ever compared to her in my whole 22 years of life. No one else. I may not have much, but I have more determination then any man you're ever likely to meet.

Afterward, he was nice to me.  So nice.  He drove me home, held my hand, told me he loved me, gave me a hug...  Then he told me that he was going to his sister&amp;#39;s, promised he&amp;#39;d be back.  Instead, two hours later the police showed up at our door and told me I was being arrested for assault.  I was taken directly to the hospital.  I am now on suicide watch in my small, local hospital and awaiting transfer to the psychiatric ward in the nearby city.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m only playing along with this.  I don&amp;#39;t have any desire to get well.  I don&amp;#39;t have any desire to sign divorce papers and watch my husband move on and live life without me.  I know that when I&amp;#39;m finally released from the hospital, if I&amp;#39;m left alone, I will end my life.  I don&amp;#39;t have the strength to endure this.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening, friendly Redditors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1322771675,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

I didn't intend for all that to come out. Sorry for the wall of text.\n\nIt started out innocent enough. I had a paper due in my psychology class that I didn't do, and was embarrassed about that, so I stayed home that day to avoid running into my professor. I figured I'd do my paper that day and turn it in next class.  \n \nHowever, I procrastinated doing the paper all day and by the time my next psychology class rolled around, I still hadn't done my paper. I stayed home again, thinking I'd do the paper *next* class. I didn't, and by then I was too ashamed of skipping class to show up to class. \n \nI started skipping other classes too. I'd miss an assignment in calculus, so I wouldn't show up. I'd miss a group meeting with my Engineering class, so I wouldn't show up. Now it's been *FOUR WEEKS* and I haven't shown up to class at all. Not only that, but I haven't been keeping up on my work or doing my assignments. I've probably missed a test or two as well. \n \nI've been in this place before, too. I've failed six out of the ten classes I've taken at college, and I really wanted to turn that around this semester. I did the same thing last semester, and the semester before that, and the summer session before that... I have a problem. \n \nI've also been isolating myself from my friends and family for even longer, and haven't talked to anyone for months. I'm just so ashamed of my failures that I avoid talking to people whenever possible. I'm sure they either think I died or they have forgotten about me, since no one has made any attempts to find out where I am and why I haven't been talking to them. The only person I have to talk to is my dad, and he does what he can but it just isn't enough, ya know? \n \nIt's getting hard to even go out of my house, and I think I'm starting to become paranoid that everyone secretly hates me and only tolerates me because they don't want to be rude. \n \nReddit has become my only outlet for my loneliness and frustration, and so I spend hours just arguing with people. About anything. Even things I don't know anything about and don't even *care* about. I've recently realized that this hasn't done anything to fill that void, and instead all it has done is make me crave human interaction more. \n \nI know this is stupid and irrational, and accepting that has done nothing but made me angry at myself. I should just go to class, talk to my professor, do my assignments, get everything straightened out... but I can't. I know I should just talk to someone -- talk to *anyone* -- but I just can't fucking do it, and I think my anxiety has driven me into depression. \n \nI'm not eating right, I'm not sleeping right, I'm not getting any work done, I'm not interacting with people, and I'm not doing anything to make it better. I feel like I'm stuck in a downward spiral and I can't get out. I'm 19 years old for fucks sake, yet I feel like my life is already ruined. \n \nAnyway, that's my story. I'm too ashamed of my life to face the world.\n\n**EDIT 4 DAYS LATER** I saw a counselor today, and I have an appointment with my doctor to get onto some medication.

I didn&amp;#39;t intend for all that to come out. Sorry for the wall of text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It started out innocent enough. I had a paper due in my psychology class that I didn&amp;#39;t do, and was embarrassed about that, so I stayed home that day to avoid running into my professor. I figured I&amp;#39;d do my paper that day and turn it in next class.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I procrastinated doing the paper all day and by the time my next psychology class rolled around, I still hadn&amp;#39;t done my paper. I stayed home again, thinking I&amp;#39;d do the paper &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; class. I didn&amp;#39;t, and by then I was too ashamed of skipping class to show up to class. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started skipping other classes too. I&amp;#39;d miss an assignment in calculus, so I wouldn&amp;#39;t show up. I&amp;#39;d miss a group meeting with my Engineering class, so I wouldn&amp;#39;t show up. Now it&amp;#39;s been &lt;em&gt;FOUR WEEKS&lt;/em&gt; and I haven&amp;#39;t shown up to class at all. Not only that, but I haven&amp;#39;t been keeping up on my work or doing my assignments. I&amp;#39;ve probably missed a test or two as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been in this place before, too. I&amp;#39;ve failed six out of the ten classes I&amp;#39;ve taken at college, and I really wanted to turn that around this semester. I did the same thing last semester, and the semester before that, and the summer session before that... I have a problem. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also been isolating myself from my friends and family for even longer, and haven&amp;#39;t talked to anyone for months. I&amp;#39;m just so ashamed of my failures that I avoid talking to people whenever possible. I&amp;#39;m sure they either think I died or they have forgotten about me, since no one has made any attempts to find out where I am and why I haven&amp;#39;t been talking to them. The only person I have to talk to is my dad, and he does what he can but it just isn&amp;#39;t enough, ya know? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s getting hard to even go out of my house, and I think I&amp;#39;m starting to become paranoid that everyone secretly hates me and only tolerates me because they don&amp;#39;t want to be rude. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reddit has become my only outlet for my loneliness and frustration, and so I spend hours just arguing with people. About anything. Even things I don&amp;#39;t know anything about and don&amp;#39;t even &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt; about. I&amp;#39;ve recently realized that this hasn&amp;#39;t done anything to fill that void, and instead all it has done is make me crave human interaction more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this is stupid and irrational, and accepting that has done nothing but made me angry at myself. I should just go to class, talk to my professor, do my assignments, get everything straightened out... but I can&amp;#39;t. I know I should just talk to someone -- talk to &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; -- but I just can&amp;#39;t fucking do it, and I think my anxiety has driven me into depression. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not eating right, I&amp;#39;m not sleeping right, I&amp;#39;m not getting any work done, I&amp;#39;m not interacting with people, and I&amp;#39;m not doing anything to make it better. I feel like I&amp;#39;m stuck in a downward spiral and I can&amp;#39;t get out. I&amp;#39;m 19 years old for fucks sake, yet I feel like my life is already ruined. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;#39;s my story. I&amp;#39;m too ashamed of my life to face the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 4 DAYS LATER&lt;/strong&gt; I saw a counselor today, and I have an appointment with my doctor to get onto some medication.

Is my liver totally fucked? Will my heart just give out? I&amp;#39;m scared of giving it up as a medicine, but worried that prolonged use of it will only lead to more significant health concerns. Has anyone had a similar experience with this type of medicine? Any insight on this situation would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1322758583,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

All be damned if I am not around to see  my grandkids!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t take before pictures because I didn&amp;#39;t think I would lose any weight.  Been here before with a paid personal trainer.  Now that im loosing I am taking some pics!  Oh also my reward for this goal is a new bike to bike commute 10 miles one way to work!  Save on gas, wear and tear on truck and get in 2 hours of cardio a day!  Finally an advantage to the weather in Arizona!  Anywho, sorry about my excited rambling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1322755708,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

I'm 18, male, and was dating a 9 month older woman for 16 months. It was *really* great. Thing is, a few months before I had a **VERY** important exam, she asked for a break-up. I asked if it could wait a little. She said okay, but asked for some time alone. Since she promised she wouldn't see other men, I accepted.\n\nOnly, she did. One month into the break, she (completely sober) kissed another man. And shortly after had sex with him. Two weeks before said exam, she tells me... and I'm heartbroken. It was terrible. She never apologized and I thought of suicide several times (when I told her, she said she didn't care if I killed myself).\n\nTime passed, and I was starting to feel better. That was a couple months ago, and I have another of those exams in two weeks. Yesterday, however, I was shown a picture of the guy she slept with. It was uncomfortable having a face to imagine, but it was no big deal.\n\nHere's the thing, though. First, she broke up saying she didn't need my love anymore, because she had the love from her friends. That hurts, but alright. Only *now* I find out she doesn't have any friends anymore! She scared them all away by being such a deceiving and annoying brat. And actually, the only person that actually talks to her is that bastard, and they are *still* seeing and fucking each other.\n\nThat was the drop. I'm **livid** right now.\n\nI have sex tapes from both of us, mostly her in very awkward situations (maid costume, close-ups on her face, the stuff) and I'm seriously considering posting online and linking her whole college to it.\n\nI know it's not the right thing to do, but I can't just sit around and do nothing, can I?\n\nI'm just so angry it's hard to think straight... Any help, please?\n\nEdit: Thanks, guys... I knew I really shouldn't, but some reassurance is great when I'm really angry. I won't post the tapes.

I&amp;#39;m 18, male, and was dating a 9 month older woman for 16 months. It was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; great. Thing is, a few months before I had a &lt;strong&gt;VERY&lt;/strong&gt; important exam, she asked for a break-up. I asked if it could wait a little. She said okay, but asked for some time alone. Since she promised she wouldn&amp;#39;t see other men, I accepted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only, she did. One month into the break, she (completely sober) kissed another man. And shortly after had sex with him. Two weeks before said exam, she tells me... and I&amp;#39;m heartbroken. It was terrible. She never apologized and I thought of suicide several times (when I told her, she said she didn&amp;#39;t care if I killed myself).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time passed, and I was starting to feel better. That was a couple months ago, and I have another of those exams in two weeks. Yesterday, however, I was shown a picture of the guy she slept with. It was uncomfortable having a face to imagine, but it was no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the thing, though. First, she broke up saying she didn&amp;#39;t need my love anymore, because she had the love from her friends. That hurts, but alright. Only &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; I find out she doesn&amp;#39;t have any friends anymore! She scared them all away by being such a deceiving and annoying brat. And actually, the only person that actually talks to her is that bastard, and they are &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; seeing and fucking each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was the drop. I&amp;#39;m &lt;strong&gt;livid&lt;/strong&gt; right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have sex tapes from both of us, mostly her in very awkward situations (maid costume, close-ups on her face, the stuff) and I&amp;#39;m seriously considering posting online and linking her whole college to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#39;s not the right thing to do, but I can&amp;#39;t just sit around and do nothing, can I?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just so angry it&amp;#39;s hard to think straight... Any help, please?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thanks, guys... I knew I really shouldn&amp;#39;t, but some reassurance is great when I&amp;#39;m really angry. I won&amp;#39;t post the tapes.

It has happened in 2 separate locations.\n\nState: Texas\nSchool District: Klein ISD, Cleveland ISD\nSchools: Klein Oak High School, Cleveland High School\n\nI was a Teenage Boy when all this happened(13-16). My Parents, My Siblings(1 Brother, 2 Sisters), and I moved to a new house in the Klein ISD School District. I was in 8th grade when we moved. The middle school had a unique perk starting just this year. All teachers and students in the school were leased a Laptop(Had to pay $80 insurance) to use during classes and bring home for the entire school year. \nNow this part has nothing to do with the legal problems but I am giving a backstory.\n\nWe basically spent the entire year doing classwork, homework, and tests on this computer. The setup was basically, \"Laptop &lt;-&gt; WEP Encrypted Wifi &lt;-&gt; Network Servers(for homework, etc.) / Internet\".\nRemember how I said I was shy and had Social Anxiety? Well I didn't really know how to communicate with people. But essentially I heard guys and girls that said they wanted to go to MySpace or some game websites. I knew about proxies before I went to that school so the knowledge helped me help others. \nThey had a two tier system of filtering websites. One was a network-wide based filter and the other one was a Native application. \nAt anytime only 1 was active. If we were using the school network the local application was inactive and if we were at home the local application would become active.\nThey had a couple of flaws.\n1. The network-wide based filter didn't filter SSL websites(However the Native application did) so we could just use the https version of a site or if that option wasn't available you could just use the https version of a web-based proxy.\n2. You could essentially bypass the native application while at home by booting up the laptop with a Live OS(In my case it was Damn Small Linux / Puppy Linux). And while at home surf anything you wanted on the device(Though I could just use my own computer. Other people at my school didn't have to themselves or didn't have one at all.)\n\n\nNow lets skip to the next grade. My legal problems didn't occur until I was in 9th grade. Since they considered the first trial such a success(Which is really debatable), they expanded the program to one of the districts high schools. Which consequently was the High School I was headed to. Over the summer I learned new things.\nBasically the computers were set with network login credentials. \nAnd connected to network folders.(Basically they called it the N and Z drive.)\nThe N drive was our own personal network storage for storing our classwork, etc. So that incase there happens to be a fault with the computer the student wouldn't lose there work.\nThe Z Drive was where we would put our work when requested to / completed. Inside the Z Drive was each teacher in the school and we just go to there folder and leave the document there with our name and the assignment name.\n\nOne day(October 31st, 2008 which was a Friday I remember that day clearly.) I was in my AutoCAD Elective Class.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dxVhN.png I made a picture of what the classroom looked like.\nWe used desktop computers while in that class to use AutoCAD.\nNone of our work is saved to the computers. It is saved to our personal N drive. \nSo one day my N drive *cough* *cough* randomly *cough* *cough* decides to not work. Couldn't access it at all. So my teacher told me to fill out a tech report and give it to the tech department so they will fix it.\nSince we were very far into AutoCAD my teacher said I didn't have to start from the beginning I just had to catch up whenever they fixed it.\nSo I was fooling around and there were people next to me. They were bragging about playing pokemon through emulators(O.o). So while I overheard them I was just messing around on the computer. \nI found this location, can't remember accurately but something like, \"\\\\KleinISD\\hrdepartment\\\" Basically the location had excel spreadsheets that contained the information of every employee in the district. Around 5000. \nIt had Names, Spouses, Addresses, Phone Numbers, Social Security, Insurance Information, Paygrade, etc.\nI had an idea of how serious this information was but for some reason I didn't think this file was real / accurate. But anyways the people beside me were seniors. I was trying to show off and even before that they thought I was techie(helping with proxies, games, etc). I don't remember exactly how the conversation was brought up but basically I casually told them looked what I hacked into. I showed them the information and they were amazed. It was near the end of the period and the bell rang.\nSo in my next period which was geography. Well basically I bragged off to like 1-2 people that were always picking on me about the information I had. They went back to there seat and a couple of minutes before the actual class started the person I bragged to asked the teacher to come. Even though they were far away I could hear what he was saying. Basically what I heard when the teacher responded to the student was jokingly said, \" I don't have any money in my bank account anyways\". I think he thought it wasn't true. :P\n\nWell that period is over and I went to my next elective which was Computer Science? Something like that. Basically they taught excel, powerpoint, etc...\nI was bragging to some people / friends that knew me as a technical person about the information. Saying like \"If the police, principal, teachers, ask what they knew about me. Say I wasn't very technical with computers.\" I was trying to make them think I hacked to get the information which I didn't.\nWell then next period started which was gym. So we were in the locker room changing. It was like a 5-10 minute wait before we went outside.\nSo I was on my laptop showing off the information to alot of people. I said \"I could use this make me thousands of dollars.\" I was just saying it casually. So we went outside and then the 5 minute bell before class was over rang and we went inside to change back into our regular cloths. Then soon as we were done we went to our final class of the day. Mine was Science. So basically I had neighborhood kid sitting behind me. He was pretty cool. Very technical. I told him the same story about principal, police, and teachers as I did with the people in my 5th period. And I told him the same thing about making money off it.\nWas joking around of course. But he thought I was serious for a moment but I told him I was joking and he figured my intentions were non-ill.\nSo like 3 minutes into my class, a tech department person and the assistant principal for 9th grade came in and looked at me and said don't touch your laptop.\nBasically they heard from a person in my gym class saying I hacked to obtain this information and was planning on using it for fraud. They lead me to the assistant principals office and had me explain. I was kept there even after school let out.\nI told them I just randomly found this information that same day and wasn't planning to use it. So basically it was a hour after school let out and I was asking if I can leave. They said I could but to return to the office monday morning(It was a friday.) They called my parents about the situation and I had to explain myself clearly to them what happened.\nSo the weekend passed, my Halloween ruined.\nWent to school Monday and went to the office like they told me. \nSo basically I told them I told people I was joking around. And I said a few of the names of people I told that were kind of like friends. \nThey had me in a separate room when they were asking them questions. But I could hear one of them saying that I told them to say, \"If the police, principal, teachers, ask what they knew about me. Say I wasn't very technical with computers.\" to them. I was just joking around when saying that to them to make it seem more impressive...\nSo basically after all that I was arrested brought down to downtown houston Juvenile Detention center. They Fingerprinted, Took pictures, had me take a drug test(?), they put me on a computer to answer questions to determine physiological state. I was only there till like 5 P.M. and my dad picked me up. \nAfter the initial suspension went by the school said I was to be placed in Alternative Education Center(Where people who get in trouble get sent). Thats what they first said. Then they said that I was to be placed in a Out of district Alternative Education Center(The place where Multiple Schools ISDs send student who get in trouble while already at the in-school district Alternative Education Center).\nSo Essentially they skipped me through because they deemed me dangerous to normal people? By the way they would not provide transportation to this place. It was 40 miles away and in the opposite direction of where my parents work.\n\nSo essentially my parents decided to move to the Humble ISD school district.\nThey called before we moved and tried to enroll me in there but they asked if I got into trouble before and my parent had to say yes. So that school district said I would be in the in-district Alternative Education center. So my parents said that was fine and we moved. But then the district later on called my old district, etc. And figure out what happened. And you know what they did? They told my parents after we all moved that I would have to be placed in a out of district alternative education center(I thought the whole point of the original school district placing me there was because they didn't want me in there district at all. They had a PR nightmare with the employees. Didn't think this school was going to do that.). I mean we moved for nothing.\n\nThis one provided Bus transportation at a certain point though. It was 15 miles away from where we lived and was in the opposite direction of where my parents worked.\nThis place was the worst of the worst. This was the place normally districts would send after they got out of juvenile jail for weapons / drugs/ etc. Pic: http://i.imgur.com/OoWqu.png\n\nActually had one student overdose and die at this place while I was there.\n\nI've been typing for a hour or so and its starting to get annoying so I'll make this part short.\nNow after that school year was over we happened to move to Cleveland ISD.\nWe had computers in certain electives. And me being my dumb self I decide to show-off to make friends since I was in that horrible place for like 7 months and I was the only white person and everyone hated me. And when we moved to cleveland I had no one to talk to for 3 months(Remember me being shy.) \nDuring that time someone related to the police showed up to give the court documents to me and my parents. The school was charging me with a felony 1st degree saying I had intent to commit fraud which would end me up in Juvenile facility(I was 14 at the time and 15 when this got settled). The court appointed lawyer said that its good to lengthen out the cases and just keep delaying as long as possible. When we finally decided to settle it my lawyer managed to get the judge to only give me 6 months probation with community service. And for some reason Anger management and Theft classes? I lol'd because up until this day I have never yelled at another person outside my family and never got into a single fight. Also the classes were on separate days and like 20 mile drive to there and back. My parents couldn't afford the gas. \n\nOver the course of a couple of weeks I repeatedly shutdown the thin-client computers to impress people so we wouldn't have to do work...\nIn my other class on the desktop I managed to get administrator level privileges and was showing off to one kid. I could reset everyones password in the district through some application on the network.(Don't ask me how. I am not a very technical person and hardly can remember anything. I just was looking around and found it.)\nSo I reset everyones password and reset the entire network. No one could log in. Though they had a backup and fixed it within 20mins.\nA couple of weeks later in that class me and the person I was showing off to were friends now. He was very interested in Linux. And I told him about some Distros that I used while I was in my other school and others I found over the summer for example Back-track, #1 tool for script kiddies..\nAnyways I burned some discs and he showed me what he burned at home. We booted up the computers we were using in that class with the linux distros each other burned. While I used Puppy Linux before I hadn't used it in a while so I was seeing what updates there were.\nBut basically a police officer, Principal, and a tech person come in and find see us. I don't know how but they somehow thought I was the caused the issues of the network. Anyways my supposed \"friend\" tells them that he saw me do everything. The only reason he snitched is because he was a senior and 18 and the officer was threatening to take him to jail.\nWell they to me to the local courthouse, fingerprinted me, etc. They couldn't do much more because they couldn't contact my parents and since I was a juvenile they drove me back to the school(?) and then the school found out what I did at previous school. They were asking if I had encountered any financial / employee information. I kept telling them no..\nI told them how I did everything. That it was all wide open and didn't require any \"Hacker tools\".\nWell then school bell ringed and school was out and I asked if I'm allowed to go. They let me get on my bus.\nTold my parents later that night what happened. I was scared. But to honest they didn't seem to care anymore.\n\nAnyways I was sent to alternative school again and the same for my friend that did nothing(wth..)\nAnd like a month later early in the morning that same cop arrested me and another cop arrested my friend(He was sent to Jail since he was 18). \nWhile in the car I ask the cop why he was arresting me again for the same thing. Unresponsive at first I persisted and he said it wasn't related to that. He said that the I.T. department for the school was getting anonymous threats against them and they said we were the only choice.(Which neither I or my Friend did)\nWell anyways They take me to the schools police department and fingerprint me again.. and to the courthouse again and then back to school police department.. They said they were going to take me to the Juvenile Center after they inform my parents.. Once again they couldn't get in contact with my parents(Winning!) and they just drove me back the Alternative Education center. Just when the last class period was starting. People saw me get arrested and wondered why I was back here. lol\nBut anyways I told my parents and they didn't like it in cleveland. It's a horrible drug addict redneck country hick town. And with the 3rd charges we just moved to Dallas, TX.\nAnyways the probation was broken by getting in trouble for a 2nd time but my parents didn't care about it anymore. \n\nAnyways I was forced to drop out at 10th grade because I were to be enrolled they would find me and arrest me for breaking probation from a felony charge.\nThe place we live in is under the landlords name, etc.\nNo way they can find me.\nUntil then I just have to hide out.\nMy parents didn't seem worried about my education. They didn't even worry about homeschooling. They assume I am smart enough and can figure out what to do when I turn 18.\n\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr Stupid kid gets caught and gets charged with a felony. Goes to alternative education center for rest of the year. Next year goes different school district. Gets in trouble for something not as big but charged with a misdemeanor, etc. Gets arrested again for something that they accused me of which I didn't do. Breaks probation moved to Dallas. Parents forced me to drop out with 10th grade education and Hiding out till all these Juvenile charges get dropped. Currently just informing myself on the internet and waiting till I am 18 to get a GED.\n\nNow after reading either the long or the tl;dr. I'd like to ask how to get my life back together. The problem was I liked to explore to much and my curiosity got me in trouble but lets  leave that aside.\nI have no way of getting proper education.

Well basically I bragged off to like 1-2 people that were always picking on me about the information I had. They went back to there seat and a couple of minutes before the actual class started the person I bragged to asked the teacher to come. Even though they were far away I could hear what he was saying. Basically what I heard when the teacher responded to the student was jokingly said, &amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t have any money in my bank account anyways&amp;quot;. I think he thought it wasn&amp;#39;t true. :P&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well that period is over and I went to my next elective which was Computer Science? Something like that. Basically they taught excel, powerpoint, etc...\nI was bragging to some people / friends that knew me as a technical person about the information. Saying like &amp;quot;If the police, principal, teachers, ask what they knew about me. Say I wasn&amp;#39;t very technical with computers.&amp;quot; I was trying to make them think I hacked to get the information which I didn&amp;#39;t.\nWell then next period started which was gym. So we were in the locker room changing. It was like a 5-10 minute wait before we went outside.\nSo I was on my laptop showing off the information to alot of people. I said &amp;quot;I could use this make me thousands of dollars.&amp;quot; I was just saying it casually. So we went outside and then the 5 minute bell before class was over rang and we went inside to change back into our regular cloths. Then soon as we were done we went to our final class of the day. Mine was Science. So basically I had neighborhood kid sitting behind me. He was pretty cool. Very technical. I told him the same story about principal, police, and teachers as I did with the people in my 5th period. And I told him the same thing about making money off it.\nWas joking around of course. But he thought I was serious for a moment but I told him I was joking and he figured my intentions were non-ill.\nSo like 3 minutes into my class, a tech department person and the assistant principal for 9th grade came in and looked at me and said don&amp;#39;t touch your laptop.\nBasically they heard from a person in my gym class saying I hacked to obtain this information and was planning on using it for fraud. They lead me to the assistant principals office and had me explain. I was kept there even after school let out.\nI told them I just randomly found this information that same day and wasn&amp;#39;t planning to use it. So basically it was a hour after school let out and I was asking if I can leave. They said I could but to return to the office monday morning(It was a friday.) They called my parents about the situation and I had to explain myself clearly to them what happened.\nSo the weekend passed, my Halloween ruined.\nWent to school Monday and went to the office like they told me. \nSo basically I told them I told people I was joking around. And I said a few of the names of people I told that were kind of like friends. \nThey had me in a separate room when they were asking them questions. But I could hear one of them saying that I told them to say, &amp;quot;If the police, principal, teachers, ask what they knew about me. Say I wasn&amp;#39;t very technical with computers.&amp;quot; to them. I was just joking around when saying that to them to make it seem more impressive...\nSo basically after all that I was arrested brought down to downtown houston Juvenile Detention center. They Fingerprinted, Took pictures, had me take a drug test(?), they put me on a computer to answer questions to determine physiological state. I was only there till like 5 P.M. and my dad picked me up. \nAfter the initial suspension went by the school said I was to be placed in Alternative Education Center(Where people who get in trouble get sent). Thats what they first said. Then they said that I was to be placed in a Out of district Alternative Education Center(The place where Multiple Schools ISDs send student who get in trouble while already at the in-school district Alternative Education Center).\nSo Essentially they skipped me through because they deemed me dangerous to normal people? By the way they would not provide transportation to this place. It was 40 miles away and in the opposite direction of where my parents work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So essentially my parents decided to move to the Humble ISD school district.\nThey called before we moved and tried to enroll me in there but they asked if I got into trouble before and my parent had to say yes. So that school district said I would be in the in-district Alternative Education center. So my parents said that was fine and we moved. But then the district later on called my old district, etc. And figure out what happened. And you know what they did? They told my parents after we all moved that I would have to be placed in a out of district alternative education center(I thought the whole point of the original school district placing me there was because they didn&amp;#39;t want me in there district at all. They had a PR nightmare with the employees. Didn&amp;#39;t think this school was going to do that.). I mean we moved for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one provided Bus transportation at a certain point though. It was 15 miles away from where we lived and was in the opposite direction of where my parents worked.\nThis place was the worst of the worst. This was the place normally districts would send after they got out of juvenile jail for weapons / drugs/ etc. Pic: &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/OoWqu.png\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/OoWqu.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually had one student overdose and die at this place while I was there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been typing for a hour or so and its starting to get annoying so I&amp;#39;ll make this part short.\nNow after that school year was over we happened to move to Cleveland ISD.\nWe had computers in certain electives. And me being my dumb self I decide to show-off to make friends since I was in that horrible place for like 7 months and I was the only white person and everyone hated me. And when we moved to cleveland I had no one to talk to for 3 months(Remember me being shy.) \nDuring that time someone related to the police showed up to give the court documents to me and my parents. The school was charging me with a felony 1st degree saying I had intent to commit fraud which would end me up in Juvenile facility(I was 14 at the time and 15 when this got settled). The court appointed lawyer said that its good to lengthen out the cases and just keep delaying as long as possible. When we finally decided to settle it my lawyer managed to get the judge to only give me 6 months probation with community service. And for some reason Anger management and Theft classes? I lol&amp;#39;d because up until this day I have never yelled at another person outside my family and never got into a single fight. Also the classes were on separate days and like 20 mile drive to there and back. My parents couldn&amp;#39;t afford the gas. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a couple of weeks I repeatedly shutdown the thin-client computers to impress people so we wouldn&amp;#39;t have to do work...\nIn my other class on the desktop I managed to get administrator level privileges and was showing off to one kid. I could reset everyones password in the district through some application on the network.(Don&amp;#39;t ask me how. I am not a very technical person and hardly can remember anything. I just was looking around and found it.)\nSo I reset everyones password and reset the entire network. No one could log in. Though they had a backup and fixed it within 20mins.\nA couple of weeks later in that class me and the person I was showing off to were friends now. He was very interested in Linux. And I told him about some Distros that I used while I was in my other school and others I found over the summer for example Back-track, #1 tool for script kiddies..\nAnyways I burned some discs and he showed me what he burned at home. We booted up the computers we were using in that class with the linux distros each other burned. While I used Puppy Linux before I hadn&amp;#39;t used it in a while so I was seeing what updates there were.\nBut basically a police officer, Principal, and a tech person come in and find see us. I don&amp;#39;t know how but they somehow thought I was the caused the issues of the network. Anyways my supposed &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; tells them that he saw me do everything. The only reason he snitched is because he was a senior and 18 and the officer was threatening to take him to jail.\nWell they to me to the local courthouse, fingerprinted me, etc. They couldn&amp;#39;t do much more because they couldn&amp;#39;t contact my parents and since I was a juvenile they drove me back to the school(?) and then the school found out what I did at previous school. They were asking if I had encountered any financial / employee information. I kept telling them no..\nI told them how I did everything. That it was all wide open and didn&amp;#39;t require any &amp;quot;Hacker tools&amp;quot;.\nWell then school bell ringed and school was out and I asked if I&amp;#39;m allowed to go. They let me get on my bus.\nTold my parents later that night what happened. I was scared. But to honest they didn&amp;#39;t seem to care anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways I was sent to alternative school again and the same for my friend that did nothing(wth..)\nAnd like a month later early in the morning that same cop arrested me and another cop arrested my friend(He was sent to Jail since he was 18). \nWhile in the car I ask the cop why he was arresting me again for the same thing. Unresponsive at first I persisted and he said it wasn&amp;#39;t related to that. He said that the I.T. department for the school was getting anonymous threats against them and they said we were the only choice.(Which neither I or my Friend did)\nWell anyways They take me to the schools police department and fingerprint me again.. and to the courthouse again and then back to school police department.. They said they were going to take me to the Juvenile Center after they inform my parents.. Once again they couldn&amp;#39;t get in contact with my parents(Winning!) and they just drove me back the Alternative Education center. Just when the last class period was starting. People saw me get arrested and wondered why I was back here. lol\nBut anyways I told my parents and they didn&amp;#39;t like it in cleveland. It&amp;#39;s a horrible drug addict redneck country hick town. And with the 3rd charges we just moved to Dallas, TX.\nAnyways the probation was broken by getting in trouble for a 2nd time but my parents didn&amp;#39;t care about it anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways I was forced to drop out at 10th grade because I were to be enrolled they would find me and arrest me for breaking probation from a felony charge.\nThe place we live in is under the landlords name, etc.\nNo way they can find me.\nUntil then I just have to hide out.\nMy parents didn&amp;#39;t seem worried about my education. They didn&amp;#39;t even worry about homeschooling. They assume I am smart enough and can figure out what to do when I turn 18.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr Stupid kid gets caught and gets charged with a felony. Goes to alternative education center for rest of the year. Next year goes different school district. Gets in trouble for something not as big but charged with a misdemeanor, etc. Gets arrested again for something that they accused me of which I didn&amp;#39;t do. Breaks probation moved to Dallas. Parents forced me to drop out with 10th grade education and Hiding out till all these Juvenile charges get dropped. Currently just informing myself on the internet and waiting till I am 18 to get a GED.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now after reading either the long or the tl;dr. I&amp;#39;d like to ask how to get my life back together. The problem was I liked to explore to much and my curiosity got me in trouble but lets  leave that aside.\nI have no way of getting proper education. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1322733666,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

I've read all the help pages and such, so I  hope this works. This is also long... so I am sorry for that too.)\n\nI am 23/M, and I am gay. (Actually my sexual identity is much deeper, but for the sake of convenience, let's just go with \"gay\", alright?)\n\nI have lived with my family for 23 years. Unfortunately, I've been unable to move out and live on my own. I have severe difficulties with psychological and emotional issues that cloud my ability to function \"normally\" and due to my history with suicide (attempts in '06 and '07 and relapses in '10 and '11 that required me to be on suicide watches) I am not permitted by my doctors to take any antidepressants or mood-altering drugs whatsoever. Counseling/therapy is really my only discourse and since I am no longer enrolled at the university I previously attended... I have no access to medical assistance or counseling. I'm kind of on my own.\n\nNeedless to say, I can't work. I can, but I don't function well. I've been fired from every menial job I have ever held for \"poor performance\". I don't make much money at all, and what little money I have is made through taking artwork commissions, and I string it along as thinly as possible. I do what I can. It is not enough to pay my own bills, but it's \"something\".\n\nDespite all of this, though, I met a truly wonderful guy online. We have been friends for three years, and I love him so very much. He makes me laugh, he makes me cry (in a good way), and he makes me feel wanted and loved most of all. Recently he and I really found a lot in common with one another... and we want to pursue a relationship. I truly want to get to know him better. I don't know what \"the one\" is, but I just know I love him.\n\nThe problem is that he lives in Ontario and I live in Texas (hence the handle \"TX_dragon\").\n\n\nThat's only one problem, really. I'm 23... and I've never had a quality relationship before. I fooled around experimentally with some guy friends when I was in public school and I dated a few girls (to throw my parents off)... but I don't know what a relationship is. I've hardly even had any sexual contact. In the relationships I did try out, I was taken advantage of and abused. I associate relationships with awful feelings. I know my boyfriend wouldn't harm a hair on my head... but it's a realization that I have a hard time understanding. Nobody has ever just \"loved\" me. Cue apprehension #1. :(\n\nMy family is not accepting of my lifestyle. I am in the closet to them. My mother is *THE* definition of \"homophobe\". She believes that all gays are flamboyant, have AIDS, are sexually promiscuous, and are child predators. I am not BS'ing you, I am dead serious. There is no way in hell I am ever telling her, because she wouldn't have any of it. She is constantly attempting to guilt me into asking girls who flirt with me for their number, and she is always \"soccer mom'ing\" with other menopausal nobodies on Facebook who have single daughters trying to hook me up. I find it rude and distasteful. My father is a nice guy, he has told me many times that he only wants me to pursue what makes me happy... but I can't come out to him. I think he might have an idea, because he has given up on asking me if I'm ever going out on dates when I leave the house at night and such, but telling him would just break his heart. He wants grandchildren and would just be disappointed in me. Plus he is completely submissive to my mother so anything I say to him I might as well just tell to my mother's face. So that's not happening.\n\nMy mother is the dominant parent in my life. She has never given me any positive encouragement whatsoever. I am one of those \"early bloomer\" kids, the kind who read from a very young age and who made incredible marks in school. I didn't care about it though. I've always pursued what made me happy, and even though I did try in school, I could have \"tried harder\" I guess. \"Tried harder.\" That's all my mother ever said to me. When I would take home an A- on a spelling test she would take one look at it and say nothing more than \"you could have gotten an A+ if you tried harder\". That was my entire life. Try harder. Nothing is good enough. I don't remember what my high school class rank was (24? It's been a while.) but lo and behold, the first thing she said to me was \"you could have been valedictorian if you only tried harder\". Skipped right over the \"wow, son, you've finished high school, you're grown up now, stepping into adulthood, I'm so proud\" part. Yep. Try harder. Hilariously enough, even when I was in university I still got this when she would look at my final grades. Even my final GPA (3.51, cum laude), was something I could have \"tried harder\" on.\n\nShe does this to me because she wants me to be famous so she can just be prideful by proxy. She is like Justin Bieber's mom. Plain and simple.\n\nSo now I have this demon in the back of my head that makes me feel like everything I do is never good enough. That I am worthless. I'm broken. Anything I do is just sub-par, that it's never something I should be proud of. I am a writer and an artist, that's the only thing I am good at I feel, and yet every time I finish something I immediately hate it, because I guess it would look better if I tried harder. I feel like I am doomed to fail at everything I do, and the fact that I'm not psychologically stable enough to hold a job - five of them - cements that notion in my mind.\n\nI know I am in an abusive household. My friends have told me this. I have to get out of here, but here's the problem: I can't. I can't work. Not at the caliber required to pay even the cheapest of rent. I don't really have friends I can reach out to whose couches I can sleep on for an indefinite period of time. But I have my boyfriend in Ontario, and I want to visit him and get to know him even better because I want to be with him.\n\nBut the thing with abuse is it's fucking HARD to get away from. My mother is a manipulative and controlling person. She knows that I suffer from issues with anxiety and panic attacks and depression. She fostered all of them. Rather than allow me to get the help I needed when I was younger, she crippled me. Because she wants me to live in her house forever. I know this. She is literally insane. I am not saying this to speak poorly of her, SHE IS BATSHIT CRAZY. Where I live has a roof, and some food. Sure, I might suffer from nightterrors, hallucinations, amnesia, and suicidal tendencies... but it's better than being indebted and homeless. And she knows this.\n\nMy boyfriend is a very strong-willed man. He knows these problems and then some. He has told me himself that he WILL find a way to make things work if I live with him. He's Chinese and moved to Canada with his mother to pursue a better life, and he supports both him and his mother. He knows about broken families and he wants to help me out. I trust him, or at least I want to. I don't know what it feels like when \"everything will be okay\". I have never been there before. The only life I know is being jittery from hearing footsteps or telephones ringing or shouting at the other end of the house. I don't know a life away from paranoia and restlessness. The change scares me, even though it honestly should not.\n\nI want to have the strength to feel confident in this relationship. I love my boyfriend so much. Many nights I wish he were here with me in my bed so I could feel safe in someone's arms and make my hurting stop. I just don't know how to pursue this relationship, because the distance scares me.\n\nI guess, I'm asking for advice, thoughts, anything. I will read it all. I may not know what to say in response but I will read every post. I want to be happy so badly. I want to know that feeling more than anything else. I want to love and be loved and not worry about being hurt or used or belittled. I want to know what it is to be human.\n\nThank you.","domain":"self.ihaveissues","num_comments":7,"likes":null,"clicked":false,"thumbnail":"self","saved":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s90u","ups":8,"approved_by":null,"score":6,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(First and foremost I have never, ever used Reddit before so if this gets posted incorrectly or is in the wrong forum or something goes terribly wrong, I am sorry.

I have severe difficulties with psychological and emotional issues that cloud my ability to function &amp;quot;normally&amp;quot; and due to my history with suicide (attempts in &amp;#39;06 and &amp;#39;07 and relapses in &amp;#39;10 and &amp;#39;11 that required me to be on suicide watches) I am not permitted by my doctors to take any antidepressants or mood-altering drugs whatsoever. Counseling/therapy is really my only discourse and since I am no longer enrolled at the university I previously attended... I have no access to medical assistance or counseling. I&amp;#39;m kind of on my own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I can&amp;#39;t work. I can, but I don&amp;#39;t function well. I&amp;#39;ve been fired from every menial job I have ever held for &amp;quot;poor performance&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t make much money at all, and what little money I have is made through taking artwork commissions, and I string it along as thinly as possible. I do what I can. It is not enough to pay my own bills, but it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;something&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite all of this, though, I met a truly wonderful guy online. We have been friends for three years, and I love him so very much. He makes me laugh, he makes me cry (in a good way), and he makes me feel wanted and loved most of all. Recently he and I really found a lot in common with one another... and we want to pursue a relationship. I truly want to get to know him better. I don&amp;#39;t know what &amp;quot;the one&amp;quot; is, but I just know I love him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is that he lives in Ontario and I live in Texas (hence the handle &amp;quot;TX_dragon&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s only one problem, really. I&amp;#39;m 23... and I&amp;#39;ve never had a quality relationship before. I fooled around experimentally with some guy friends when I was in public school and I dated a few girls (to throw my parents off)... but I don&amp;#39;t know what a relationship is. I&amp;#39;ve hardly even had any sexual contact. In the relationships I did try out, I was taken advantage of and abused. I associate relationships with awful feelings. I know my boyfriend wouldn&amp;#39;t harm a hair on my head... but it&amp;#39;s a realization that I have a hard time understanding. Nobody has ever just &amp;quot;loved&amp;quot; me. Cue apprehension #1. :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My family is not accepting of my lifestyle. I am in the closet to them. My mother is &lt;em&gt;THE&lt;/em&gt; definition of &amp;quot;homophobe&amp;quot;. She believes that all gays are flamboyant, have AIDS, are sexually promiscuous, and are child predators. I am not BS&amp;#39;ing you, I am dead serious. There is no way in hell I am ever telling her, because she wouldn&amp;#39;t have any of it. She is constantly attempting to guilt me into asking girls who flirt with me for their number, and she is always &amp;quot;soccer mom&amp;#39;ing&amp;quot; with other menopausal nobodies on Facebook who have single daughters trying to hook me up. I find it rude and distasteful. My father is a nice guy, he has told me many times that he only wants me to pursue what makes me happy... but I can&amp;#39;t come out to him. I think he might have an idea, because he has given up on asking me if I&amp;#39;m ever going out on dates when I leave the house at night and such, but telling him would just break his heart. He wants grandchildren and would just be disappointed in me. Plus he is completely submissive to my mother so anything I say to him I might as well just tell to my mother&amp;#39;s face. So that&amp;#39;s not happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother is the dominant parent in my life. She has never given me any positive encouragement whatsoever. I am one of those &amp;quot;early bloomer&amp;quot; kids, the kind who read from a very young age and who made incredible marks in school. I didn&amp;#39;t care about it though. I&amp;#39;ve always pursued what made me happy, and even though I did try in school, I could have &amp;quot;tried harder&amp;quot; I guess. &amp;quot;Tried harder.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s all my mother ever said to me. When I would take home an A- on a spelling test she would take one look at it and say nothing more than &amp;quot;you could have gotten an A+ if you tried harder&amp;quot;. That was my entire life. Try harder. Nothing is good enough. I don&amp;#39;t remember what my high school class rank was (24? It&amp;#39;s been a while.) but lo and behold, the first thing she said to me was &amp;quot;you could have been valedictorian if you only tried harder&amp;quot;. Skipped right over the &amp;quot;wow, son, you&amp;#39;ve finished high school, you&amp;#39;re grown up now, stepping into adulthood, I&amp;#39;m so proud&amp;quot; part. Yep. Try harder. Hilariously enough, even when I was in university I still got this when she would look at my final grades. Even my final GPA (3.51, cum laude), was something I could have &amp;quot;tried harder&amp;quot; on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She does this to me because she wants me to be famous so she can just be prideful by proxy. She is like Justin Bieber&amp;#39;s mom. Plain and simple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I have this demon in the back of my head that makes me feel like everything I do is never good enough. That I am worthless. I&amp;#39;m broken. Anything I do is just sub-par, that it&amp;#39;s never something I should be proud of. I am a writer and an artist, that&amp;#39;s the only thing I am good at I feel, and yet every time I finish something I immediately hate it, because I guess it would look better if I tried harder. I feel like I am doomed to fail at everything I do, and the fact that I&amp;#39;m not psychologically stable enough to hold a job - five of them - cements that notion in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I am in an abusive household. My friends have told me this. I have to get out of here, but here&amp;#39;s the problem: I can&amp;#39;t. I can&amp;#39;t work. Not at the caliber required to pay even the cheapest of rent. I don&amp;#39;t really have friends I can reach out to whose couches I can sleep on for an indefinite period of time. But I have my boyfriend in Ontario, and I want to visit him and get to know him even better because I want to be with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the thing with abuse is it&amp;#39;s fucking HARD to get away from. My mother is a manipulative and controlling person. She knows that I suffer from issues with anxiety and panic attacks and depression. She fostered all of them. Rather than allow me to get the help I needed when I was younger, she crippled me. Because she wants me to live in her house forever. I know this. She is literally insane. I am not saying this to speak poorly of her, SHE IS BATSHIT CRAZY. Where I live has a roof, and some food. Sure, I might suffer from nightterrors, hallucinations, amnesia, and suicidal tendencies... but it&amp;#39;s better than being indebted and homeless. And she knows this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend is a very strong-willed man. He knows these problems and then some. He has told me himself that he WILL find a way to make things work if I live with him. He&amp;#39;s Chinese and moved to Canada with his mother to pursue a better life, and he supports both him and his mother. He knows about broken families and he wants to help me out. I trust him, or at least I want to. I don&amp;#39;t know what it feels like when &amp;quot;everything will be okay&amp;quot;. I have never been there before. The only life I know is being jittery from hearing footsteps or telephones ringing or shouting at the other end of the house. I don&amp;#39;t know a life away from paranoia and restlessness. The change scares me, even though it honestly should not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to have the strength to feel confident in this relationship. I love my boyfriend so much. Many nights I wish he were here with me in my bed so I could feel safe in someone&amp;#39;s arms and make my hurting stop. I just don&amp;#39;t know how to pursue this relationship, because the distance scares me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess, I&amp;#39;m asking for advice, thoughts, anything. I will read it all. I may not know what to say in response but I will read every post. I want to be happy so badly. I want to know that feeling more than anything else. I want to love and be loved and not worry about being hurt or used or belittled. I want to know what it is to be human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1322724840,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}
