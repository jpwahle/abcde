I just got married with my fiance from NZ and now I have to send some documents to the government people with a $1,100 check inside for an Adjustment of Status so he can legally reside within the US after his 90 days is up.\n\n\nAlthough....since I am the only working at this time with $12 pay and 40 hour work weeks, I don't have enough right now to pay for it. I can at least save up until the 5th of August where I will send the documents. I have student and car loans that I need to pay for which will be a total of around $500, which I pay every 7th day of the month. If I don't count the costs of gas and food into my pay stubs, I will barely be able to save up for it. Right now I am basically a little above the zero mark in my bank since I had to use the rest of my money for other funds. \n\n\nSo what my question is......what do you think is the best way to save up for this without needing to sacrifice eating and whatnot? I was thinking about asking a loan with the bank but I do not know if they will let me because I am 20 years old with no credit score (though I just did buy a car a month ago by financing). They might need to ask for assets of mine and I do not think I have anything of real value. I bought a new computer a few months back, would that count? Or the car that I barely bought? A bench press with weights..? \n\n\nI was also thinking of not touching my bank at all when I get my next three paychecks and living frugally off of a credit card which I would have  to pay off starting mid-August. \n\n\nThese are just some ideas. I've really no idea what to do. My pay checks range about $700-$850, depending on how much I'm overtiming or not. I get around 23% taxes off my pay. This next pay check I will have around $630 minus the $500 of loans. It's a lower pay check because I took some days off in the time period. But the next pay check will be a full one. The third one will be a full paycheck minus the loans again, so i might be able to make it....although probably not. \n\n\nPlease let me know if you have any ideas that I could try out. I really need to pay for this, there is no other option that I can take. I tried looking up if I could finance the check, but it needs to be paid up front. \n\nIf you need any clarification if I don't make any sense or if you need any more information. Thank you for your time and your help!!!

{"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3bp2lu/my_iud_skyla_experience/","selftext":"Hi everyone,\n\nSo I've been doing a lot of reading on here about different people's experience with an IUD - insertion, long term, pros and cons, horror stories, positive stories. Figured I'd share mine as well in hopes that it could possibly help others out like previous posts helped me. \n\nFor starters, I'm 20 years old and I've been in a relationship with my SO (21M) for 6 years. I've been on Minestrin 24Fe for 5 years. The main reason I wanted to switch from hormonal BC was because I am not so great at remembering to take it all the time. We're both in school and just not ready for the possibility of having a baby. \n\n\nGETTING SET UP:\n\nThis was by far the most annoying part of the whole process. I had to make an appt with my OBGYN to see if I'm a good candidate for an IUD and for her to take cultures. I originally went in asking about Mirena, but I was quickly told that Skyla would be better for me due to my age and that I've never had children. The Skyla lasts for three years instead of five like Mirena. I was given a pamphlet to look over for a day or two until I received a call from my doctor regarding my cultures. Again, this is the annoying part, I got the call that everything was clear but then I had to wait for ANOTHER call to see if my insurance would even cover the IUD. That took a few days. finally I got the call that I was covered 100% and I scheduled my appointment. I was told to take Motrin an hour before my appointment time and to be ready to provide a urine sample for a pregnancy test. \n\n\nINSERTION:\n\nOkay I was really nervous. I read that for some people it was the worst pain they've ever felt and for some it was a slight pinch. I'm going to describe this as best as I can. My insertion was yesterday. My doctor had me lay down and put my feet up. She put in the metal clamp so that she could see my cervix. That's uncomfortable but not painful. Then she put, I want to say iodine (really sorry if that's wrong) on my cervix to help soften it a little. The next part of the process was to go through my cervix to measure the length of my uterus. I'm not going to lie, this was the worst part. It felt like a very sharp cramp while simultaneously getting a needle in the same spot. The best way I can describe the pain is sharp. It lasted for maybe 10 seconds. My doctor talked to me the whole time, talking me through everything she was doing. I liked the play by play because it have me something to focus on and it was nice knowing exactly what was happening. Then my doctor inserted the Skyla IUD. I barely felt it. I was then told to lie down for a few minutes since I was still a little crampy. My doctor told me nothing can go in my vagina for 48 hours, no tampons, no sex, no douching. Then I was given a bottle of water and a lollipop hahaha. \n\n\nAFTER:\n\nAfter, I was a little crampy. I went to the movies and only got uncomfortable one or two times because of a cramp. Later in the night I was slightly in pain due to cramps but I took Motrin and used a heating pad. That helped a lot. This morning I woke up and I haven't felt anything all day in terms of cramps or pain. I'm feeling really happy with my choice to switch from BC to the Skyla IUD. I hope this will help someone if they are still on the fence or are considering making the switch. Feel free to ask questions or share your experiences as well :)","media":null,"ups":4,"retrieved_on":1440638800,"created_utc":"1435709567","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"TwoXChromosomes","domain":"self.TwoXChromosomes","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"My IUD (Skyla) experience","secure_media_embed":{},"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3bp2lu/my_iud_skyla_experience/","secure_media":null,"created":1435713167,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r2jt","from_kind":null,"stickied":false,"score":4,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":3,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"name":"t3_3bp2lu","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"archived":false,"id":"3bp2lu","from":null,"author":"dirtygod","is_self":true}

But the drive is a little boring to be honest...It's fairly quick, but it just lacks a certain something that I can't put my finger on. \n\n**Volkswagon GTI 2009 &amp; up** - I like the engine in here and I'm a fan of the build and overall quality.

If any of this will offend you, please don't read. I need to rant and bitch a moment.\n\nSo today, my husband's cousin, who is a year younger than me, spawned again. I'm 23 for reference. Anyway, she had a baby 9 months after my first son was born. No judgement, she was 19, same age I was when my first was born. However, judgement comes from the fact that, her daughter's dad is a 40 year old married man. Cousin began babysitting for this guy and his wife when, she was 17. Also began sleeping with him at that age. So cousin had a baby girl in Dec. of 2012. The baby daddy left his wife for her, and all was well. Well, then baby daddy broke up with her, got with a new girl, and knocked her up. So now cousin acts all self righteous and that she's a proud hard working single mom, all because baby daddy isn't around. Fact of the matter, she wouldn't be in this situation had she not screwed a married man. \n\nMoving on, 2013, she meets a new guy. He moves in with her and her daughter. He has his own little boy. They get engaged and we're expecting a wedding. Instead, we get a break up announced in November. In December, we get a pregnancy announcement via the baby gaga app on Facebook. Pretty sure you all know what I'm talking about. Now at first, no judgments. Just thinking oh okay, she'll try and make it work with him. Then the back story comes out. Baby daddy 2 didn't want anymore kids. Cousin did. So instead of discussing it like a rational adult, she decided to lie about taking her birth control, and poked holes in the condom so she could get a second kid.  Turns out, reason that baby daddy 2 dumped her is, she lied about  birth control, and admitted to condom damage. He didn't want another kid, took precautions, and now has another on the way. So this whole spring and winter, we've been regaled with tales of woe about, how hard being a single mom to two will be, and how shitty of a man baby daddy is, all because he won't talk to her. Well, maybe cousin should have thought about that before she trapped the guy. \n\nSo getting to my point, the reason I'm ticked is, she plans on having two more kids. Has really easy pregnancies and labors. I really wanted to have three kids but, my body can't handle pregnancy. It breaks down and doesn't do well. How come she can get away with an easy pregnancy and labor after what she's pulled, but I can't have an easy time even with wanting more kids? I didn't trap anyone or ruin a marriage. I did it a good way. Why does this have to be unfair?

I wanted an awesome costume to scare the shit out of small children and adults alike while handing out candy, so I wanted something realistic and scary. I went on Amazon and bought this sweet-ass black cloak that also covers your face with a hood. I was browsing through some different costume scythes looking for a realistic one, but all of them looked like plastic shat. I then proceeded to look for metal cosplay scythes and found one that I liked. If you didn't get the message already, I was the Reaper for Halloween. When the big day came, I dressed up in my sweet-ass cloak and helped my friend, who came over to aid me in my spookiness, put on his makeup (he was the silence from Doctor Who). It took about 3 hours for him to perfect the makeup, but we finally engaged in our malicious Masquerade. Over the course of 2 hours we had multiple people that wouldn't dare walk up the driveway, and others who would run away screaming or dare us to chase them like little toddlers. Then came this group of kids around our age (sophomore-junior in highschool). They were walking in a group all the way up to our doorstep. One of the kids said nervously, \"that's not even scary.\" We just stood still and remained silent. They stepped forward to take some candy and my friend says in a very low voice, \"I don't think the Reaper would like it very much if you took more than one piece.\" One of the kids says, \"Fuck you Slenderman\" (he's not even Slenderman, dumbass). He takes a handful of candy and puts it into his bag. He then says, \"What're you gonna do?\" I point my scythe forward at him threateningly (the blade is dull and not at all sharp) and one of the other kids says, \"that looks pretty realistic.\" And I say, \"That's because it is. Wood handle and a stainless steel blade.\" The guy I'm pointing it at takes this in a completely different direction, \"You fuckin' pointing a weapon at me?\" I tried to respond saying, \"No, the blade is d-\" he cuts me off, \"You fuckin' threatening me?\" \"No, the blade...it isn't s-\" \"Fuck you, dude.\" The group starts to gather around us and we turn around and run back to the house. The group is yelling threats at us and they say that they'll be back later. We stayed inside with the porch lights on, scouting for these typical teen douche nozzles. We saw them pass our street later that night, and it looked like they were looking for us. The dumbasses forgot where we lived and were wondering around for a couple of hours. Lesson to be learned here, ladies and fedora-tippers: do not buy a REAL scythe and use it as a costume prop. People will be too ignorant to hear you out and threaten you after taking half of your candy.\n\nTL;DR: bought a dull, realistic looking scythe for my Reaper Halloween costume. Kid took half of my candy. I pointed my scythe at him, he threatened to come back later with his friends. Dumbasses forgot where we lived.

{"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1440638728,"selftext":"This is the most abusive anti-social e-mail I've ever read in my life. This is worse than any family drama tv could ever devise. \n\nHere's the thing about bullies, they will say the fight started when you hit them back. They can prod and jab and injur you, but as soon as you swing back thats when the fight started. So how can you respond to something like this? The crazy really comes out in the last several paragraphs. \n\nI lived 9 hours away from the 11 family members who got together in a group to discuss me, my oldest brother wrote the email, and they literally signed a paper, scanned it in, and attached it to the bottom of the e-mail. Only my mom had talked to me on a deep level about what's going on in my life in over 3 years. I've been told by peers that I'm a great listener, make them feel normal, seem like I really listen, make the city feel like home and it won't be the same without me, and that I bring a light and warmth into every room I enter... that's what people who know me say about me.\n\nI had been working on a relationship with my ex husband since late summer 2014. We lived 9 hours apart and decided to move closer so we could start counselling together and date more often. He came up to move my stuff down and I had plans on getting an apartment in the city he lived in after the semester ended. \n\nI had paid my parents my education fund to care for my two children while I was in school, for the summer I was going to do online courses and take them again, and I'd have my teaching degree in 3 years at that rate, I saw it as a no lose situation. Better future for my chilren, not a lot of single parents get their university degree, my children would be with people they love all day instead of at daycare and after school programs. My ex husband couldn't take them, because my family would have abandoned him and he would be caring for 2 young children with no family support, but was paying my parents monthly for their care as well.\n\nSo, then a terrifying moment in my life, I find out I'm pregnant with my ex husbands child from christmas holidays. This is not the sort of atmosphere I would want us to have another baby in at all, but I'm an enterpriser, I make the best of any situation and my husband and I worked out that after this semester we'd be living seperate in the same city for the first 4 months to get established and see how things are going between us, then once we where stable we'd also get our two kids and set up an established healthy family. I'd take a semester off school to care for the baby and then go back in January 2016. We told my mom this plan in February. \n\nAll is going acording to plan, I have my appartment set up to move into April 21st, I have 2 job interviews in the city I'm moving to, I have 3 more exams to write, my furniture is stored in my brothers basement in the city I'm moving to, I can do this. \n\nSuddenly, April 3rd out of nowhere I get this email\n\nDear Meghan,\n\nThis is an email from all of us in your extended family. We are writing because you are pregnant again and you are planning on moving back to ____, and we want you to know what you can expect from us. [I haven't told any of them I'm pregnant except my mom]\n\nBefore we begin, we want you to know that we are sending you this email because we love you and we care about you. We want you to be happy, healthy and safe. We want your daughters to be happy, healthy and safe. We even want your ex to be happy, healthy and safe. As you read this, you will (judging from how conversations have gone with you before) probably feel yourself starting to get defensive. Please try to let down your defences while reading this though, and let us truly speak to you. [you mean like, when I talk to 10 different people about the same situation, they each have different advice, and your advice isn't what I choose to do, is that how I've been defensive in the past? Or how you approach me to tell me to listen without having first listnened yourself or knowing anything about my situation through conversation with me but get all your information through gossip, slander, and misinformation.] Please read this and truly try to understand where we are coming from and what we are trying to communicate to you. [I really don't know where you can possibly be coming from in this, because I haven't talked to you in 3 years.]\n\nFirst, we would like to remind you of some of the good things that you have enjoyed as a member of this family. We renovated your home from being literally falling apart and barely habitable into a lovely house. [failing to mention I also spent my highschool summers and free time after school renovating my brothers house for free, while he was paid to renovate mine, spent every summer when not renovating working at the family kids camp for no pay, or when I spent all the money from my first job setting up a coffee corner in our home for the family to visit in and used my income tax to buy dad a bbq. or went to a family wedding as a guest and spent the full 2 days morning to night decorating or organizing other volunteers to decorate. Or spent 3 days shoveling gravel and dirt in my other brothers basement when he was trying to redo the floor, also for no pay... What about the good things you've enjoyed having me part of your family? Or has that gone completely unonticed?] We have been your companions both growing up and in adulthood. We have taken care of your children. When you moved to Thunder Bay, we continued to allow you to draw a salary from the family business, and you were paid way more than the work you did was worth, because we wanted you to have a chance to establish a life for yourself and for your kids. [I was most certainly working on the resource planning I was assigned. When I passed my work on to the next stage to actually be used by the staff it isn't my lack of work that made it worthless] You have had groceries and diapers bought for you. You've had car and yard work done for you. You've enjoyed all of these benefits and more. \n\nThe reason we are reminding you of the benefits that you have enjoyed as a part of this family is that right now, as the rest of this email will make clear, you are in serious danger of losing those benefits. \n\nWhen you moved to Thunder Bay, you told us that you were separating from Wade. You told us that you would not be getting back together with him unless everyone in the family accepted that the two of you were at a point where that was a reasonable step. [that's false, and would be a messed up codependent dynamic if it where true] We believed you, and wanted to help you on that path. So it wasn't an onerous burden that we had to do more work for less money because you were drawing an extra check from the family business. It wasn't an onerous burden when Mom and Dad had to take your children into their care, although that meant that Mom and Dad have been so busy being parents that they have had little time to be Grandparents to their four other grandkids. Your younger sister put her plans on hold so that she could also care for your kids, and your older sister has also sacrificed her personal time to take an expanded role in raising your kids. These are sacrifices that we willingly and happily made because you, your ex and your children are all happier, healthier and safer when you and him are not together.\n\nBut you've been lying to us, Meghan. [I have? I hadn't realized I had talked to you.]\n\nFor you to be as far along in your pregnancy as you are, you had to have been having sex with Wade since at least late November or early December. [um yeah... and?] People who are separated don't have sex with each other. [oh do tell me more about your rights to the details of my sex life. I'm 26, my six siblings and the two family friends who signed the letter range in age from 19 - 33] People who are working on building separate lives do not have sex with each other. [okay this one is probably true] But you allowed us to continue to believe that you were building a life separate from your ex, [when I mentioned to a number of you in late summer I was dating him? When I was storing some of my belongings in my brothers basement preparing to move after exams? Or when I told mom in February that I was moving? When you called me on the phone and I said \"oh no no no Wade and I are definately not working on things right now\" oh wait, that never happened, you didn't call to talk to me and haven't asked about my life] when that was clearly not the case. That deception has been extremely hurtful to all of us. \n\nThis is the second time we've all been in this exact same position, Meghan. After you had your first child, you and him were unable to care for her. He refused to help with feeding her, while you failed to communicate to him about the medical problems that were making it difficult for her to get the nutrition she required. [... wtf that isn't even true, she was having trouble breastfeeding so I bottle fed her for a couple months and pumped milk then went back to breastfeeding a few months later... there wheren't any medical problems] If Mom and your sisters hadn't intervened to take care of her, she would be dead. [um, yeah... no. I had help bottle feeding her because I decided to pump every 2 hours day and night for the first 4 months to keep my milk supply up I was a zombie for 4 months this is true. It was not a life or death situation, they helped so that I could breastfeed her, not so that she wouldn't die] After Wesley was born, your relationship with Wade, which had never been on the firmest footing, went downhill fast. Neither of you were capable of giving the 100% of each other to each other that raising a new baby requires. [yes, there are so many young newly married couples out there who are able to bring the strength of character someone who's 40 could offer. My relationship was no worse than my moms relationship with my dad and my husbands involvment was no less and no greater than the involvment my own dad gave.] So you separated for a time, and both of your attitudes and outlooks improved. Your daughter was healthier and happier. But for whatever reason, you chose to ignore the evidence that you, him and your childs lives were all better when you and him didn't live together, and you started living with Wade again. [Is that so? The email up until this point has made it so clear how astutely you observe my life and the keen eye you have for knowing what's going on]\n\nThen, before we knew it, you were pregnant again. And when the next one was born, once again, neither you nor him will be able to give of yourselves to care for your older daughter and your newborn. You fought all the time, and your children suffered. [that's true, we did fight a lot. They do have one thing acurate] So you separated again. And, it became very clear after a short while of your living on your own with your children that you are not capable of caring for your children. [yes... it must have been very clear from 9 hours away... you know, single mom living in the worst part of a crappy little city who drives a half hour morning and afternoon to make sure her children get to a carefully selected school in a good neighborhood. You know, who wanted to go to university because she was bringing in 18,000 a year and had no prospects to make a higher wage or give anything better to her children] We know that you have a self-image of yourself as a mother, but there's no point in beating about the bush. If Mom and Dad hadn't taken your children in, they would likely be dead from neglect. You weren't feeding them. You weren't changing them. [you've been in my house twice... and we all ate and the children where changed.] Hayleigh wasn't verbal at an age when she should have been trying out words. [you mean how at 1 she was saying \"double double\" at the drive through? and saying animal sounds, nodding her head to questions, pointing, you know all the normal 1 year old things to do] The point of this is not to try to make you feel ashamed. [I only feel ashamed of you for paying so little attention and claiming to know so much] There's plenty of families who're raising other family members' kids because the kids parent(s) couldn't take care of them. [what world are you inventing in which I'm unable to raise my children? I'm IN university to create a better future for them that won't have me living on 18,000 for the rest of our lives! I let my parents care for them because my mom came and begged me to let her take them so they don't have to be in daycare and afterschool programing and I insisted on paying her my grandparents education fund to help cover the costs of their care] The point is that we need to face the facts and deal with the reality of the situation that we have in front of us. [you mean, the one that you've fabricated]\n\nPlease consider that there are eleven people who have decided on the content of this email. If there are eleven people who are familiar with your situation who are all saying the same thing, maybe that's worth paying attention to even if you don't like what you're hearing. [one person who has any concept of the situation... my mom. The rest of you I have no idea where your coming from]\n\nAnd here are the facts as we see them: (1) Neither you nor your ex have magically changed into different people in the months that you have been separated. [from the many many times you've seen us and spoken to us] There is no reason for anyone (not you, not your ex, not anyone) to believe that the two of you getting back together is going to be any different this time than it has been the last times. (2) your ex has never been interested in taking on the responsibility of being a full-time father. When your children were born, he said that he would spend less time on Tae Kwon Do, but instead he increased the amount of time that he was away from home. [yes that's true, but I bet if you had given me a phone call to talk about my life instead of sending this anti-social and bizzarre e-mail you could have heard that he's been applying for an evening or weekend job as well as his regular one, offered to take parental leave when the new baby comes since I don't have benefits after being in university for the past year, and considered shiftwork at a better paying job to afford to have his family back] When you lived together, did he ever watch the kids by himself so you could go out and see friends or run errands? Did you go on family outings, as just the three or, after your new child was born, just the four of you? Even though he comes over to see the girls on weekends, he has not made a noticable effort to get to know them as the wonderful little people they are. Instead, he yells at them when they don't behave how he expects them to. He yells at them to be quiet. He even yells at them when they get upset because a grown man is yelling at them. [I've seen this yelling... it's telling them what to do in a firm voice.]That's a terrifying thing to have happen to two-year-old or a four-year-old! Your ex has showed no interest in actually being a father to his children when you were together before, and that has not changed. (3) You are not capable of caring for a child. [you have an excellent case for my poor parenting skills... I love how it's entirly fabricated] We believe that this is a result of a serious and untreated mental illness. [all of you, or at least one of you, must have some sort of qualification in mental health... you people are crazy] It's not your fault. It's nothing to be ashamed of, but pretending otherwise is going to get a child killed. [because you've made it abundantly clear all the times you've imagined that my children where in mortal danger... you know, I took them to the play place once a week in the winter to get them out of the house, the park after school every day to fly kytes and play chasekfdkgfdiffireiriktkr, a moms group and church weekly but I was most certainly neglecting them\n\nBut now you're pregnant again, and you're planning on moving to Manitoba. You're not going to be living with any of us... you can't afford to live in Winnipeg on your own. So you're going to be moving back in with Wade while you're pregnant with your third kid. And the long and the short of it is, you might not be willing to face the facts. Wade might not be willing to face the facts, but we have faced the facts, and we are not willing to go through the heartache of watching you and Wade abuse each other and neglect another kid. So if you choose to come back to Manitoba, you will be doing it on your own.\n\nHere is what we'd like to have happen: (1) We would like you to understand and acknowledge that you have hurt us and apologize. [at this stage, you will be apologizing to me for this attrocious, anti-social, abusive disaster of an e-mail if you ever want to have anything to do with me or my children again] (2) We would like you to see a psychiatrist and seek treatment (and actually stick with the treatment) for the mental illness that makes you incapable of mothering your children and incapable of analyzing a situation realistically. [wtf? wtf? wtf?] (3) We would like you to not move back to this province. (4) We would like for you to tell your ex that you are separating from him and actually go through with a divorce. Because this is not the first time that we're in this same situation, and because you keep on lying to us about your relationship with him... [you mean, I didn't call all 11 of you up on the phone to ask if it's okay for me to get back together with my husband? My goodness what grievous faux pas. I just discussed it with my mom as equals in confidence, my ex borrowed a van and trailer from my parents to move my stuff, INTO MY BROTHERS BASEMENT to be stored until I move. but your know, I've been lying and deceptive] it would be very, very hard for us to trust you if you were to say that you are actually breaking off relationship with Wade. If you are going to do this, perhaps you have some ideas for how we can believe that you mean what you say this time? [um... that's so messed up I don't even know where to start with it] (5) We would like for you to adopt your third child out. [biggest WTF!!! so far] Your kid will be white, probably will have no visible defects... so you would be able to have your pick of what kind of people could care for him or her. [okay, actually never mind, that's a much bigger WTF. You people don't have a brain among you or maybe you have a brain but no decency or sense of human dignity. I have 2 children I have done an excellent job raising, my 4 year old has now read 3 books, can write every letter and knows all their sounds, was saying 11 word sentences by 2. My 2 year old is also speaking and naming colours has been clinically evaluated at a vaccination appointment and is developing normally] You can't take care of this kid. You have never been able to take care of your kids. Your ex can't take care of this kid. He has never been willing to take care of his kids. We have no more resources to offer, as we are currently taking care of two of your kids. Please give this child a chance to grow up healthy, happy and safe and adopt it out. [my mom asked if her and my dad could care for them, I paid them my education savings to do it. Where do the rest of you fit in here? This was an agreement between 3 adults, if they had a problem with it they could have told me at any time.]\n\nHowever, given your past history, we don't believe you are going to do any of those things. [you mean my past history of evaluating a full range of options and making my own choices instead of following your prescription for my life?]\n\nAs far as we are concerned, unless we hear otherwise (and have good reason to believe it) [I better give them some good reason to believe it because I've been lying to them], you are already back together with your ex. So we want to make it very clear to you what sort of relationship we are willing to have with you so long as you are involved in that partnership. \n\nWe want the girls to stay with Mom and Dad. Love means doing what is best for the people you love, and right now (and probably for a very long time) what is best for your girls is that they remain with Mom and Dad. The girls are happier with Mom and Dad than they ever have been. They are healthy and they are safe. [you mean, when their being cared for by 5 different caretakers and say they miss their mom every day? You cannot offer health, happiness and safety to your girls. However, we will not allow either you or Wade to use your girls as emotional blackmail against us. This means we will not accept threats to take the girls from Mom and Dad if we don't do what you want. We know that neither you nor Wade can afford the time and money required to to take care of them now, but we also know that we have no legal standing if you or he do decide to take the kids from Mom and Dad. [Your right, your absolutely right. You have no legal standing because I was an entirely decent parent] So long as the kids are with Mom and Dad, they are with Mom and Dad on their terms. [after this email, I'm taking them as soon as I'm done this semester and wether I got back with my husband or not, I'd be having as little to do with these people as possible]\n\nWhen the girls see you or Wade they get very upset. They are emotionally unsettled for days after seeing either of you. [um, yes, this is entirely normal. You all work in social services, they had trainings on this. Children get upset when they see their parents because it is upsetting not to be with your parents.] you and he are disruptive presences in their lives. [not being with their mom is a disruption to their life] We do not want the girls' lives disrupted any more than is absolutely necessary. So when you move back to this province, you may see your girls one weekend a month. [I see... so every one of their aunts and cousins and grandparents will be seeing them several times a month, but their mom and dad get one weekend. I also worked in social services, that is one of the worst arrangments you would only give to extremely volatile parents] You will set your weekend with the girls one month before you are to pick them up. You will not change the date. You will come on the appointed date and pick them up from Mom and Dad. If you miss the appointed date, you will not get another opportunity to see your girls until the next month. Mom or Dad will come to your house and pick the girls up when your weekend is done. \n\nSo long as the girls remain with Mom and Dad under those terms, you will be welcome at family Christmas, Speckendicken, [Speckendicken is a pancake breakfast my grandma puts on for all the family, this isn't even their family gathering and their trying to tell me I won't be welcome] your kids' family birthday parties, [oh goody, I'm going to be invited to my childrens birthdays] and one to-be decided event in the summer. You will not be welcome at other family events, [I want nothing to do with any of you... your crazy] although some family members have said that they will still be willing to see you socially outside of family events. [I'm not willing to anymore] your ex will not be welcome at any family events. Two weeks ago, Mom and Dan discussed the contents of this email with your ex and explained to him that we will not be supporting him or you in any way if you move back to this province.\n\nWe believe that the best place for the girls right now (and for the forseeable future) is with Mom and Dad. However, we believe that once you are living with him, either you or him will decide that you want your girls to live with you as well. [already decided, they will be removed from you as quickly as possible and will be kept away from you as much as I think is healthy, as they do have attachment to you and family relationships are meaningful] Should you take your girls from Mom and Dad's care before we as a family agree that that is what is best for them, [it's happening] you will no longer be welcome at any family events. [I no longer have any desire to go] Some family members have said that even in that case they would still be willing to pick Wesley or Hayleigh up for afternoons out as their schedule allows. [not happening]\n\nWhether you take the girls or not, now that you are back with your ex, he is your support structure. You will be receiving no support from us, because we do not support that relationship. We will not give you money [we borrowed money from my parents in the first years of our marriage]. We will not buy you groceries or diapers or baby supplies [you voluntarily came by with those as gifts]. We will not loan you baby supplies that we already have. [I forgot my wipes while visiting my brothers house and borrowed my nephews wipes] Dad will not repair your vehicles. You may not use our vehicles if yours break down. [you've used my vehicles when yours break down as well. I left one of my vehicles with you for over a year] You may not use Mom and Dad's car seats [I bought those car seats on sale at Walmart]. We will not give you any labour. We will not help you move. We will not help you pick out houses or apartments. We will not do home repairs, housework or yardwork for you. In short, so long as you are with your ex, we are not willing to put ourselves out in any way to help you... That is, aside from the already massive amount of help we are giving to your girls so that they can be safe, happy and healthy. [you mean, when my mom came and asked to take them even though they where already in a good daycare and after school programing, had a sunday school and moms group we went to frequently, I was stressed and tired but I was doing everything I could] \n\nWhen we were talking about how to deal with this situation, Mom mentioned that during your last two births, both her and your ex were there, but he spent the majority of the time on his phone. Mom has said that she will not attend your next birth if you are with him. [you mean the birth of the child I'm suposed to give up for adoption. But no big deal, the little guys going to be white and have no visible defects he'll be fine.] Think very carefully. Do you want to go through labour again when the only support you are going to have during your labour is a man who is more interested in his phone than what is going on with you? [or with my mom who was the only person who knew the details of my life situation and seems to have failed to tell anyone that, you know, she actually knew everything that was going on]\n\nIf you move back to this province and move in with your ex, we will not pick up the pieces for you when your relationship once again falls apart as soon as it gets a little bit difficult. Here is a website that explains some resources that you will have to get yourself out of that situation when it arises: [was a website for womens shelters in the city I was moving to]\n\nMeghan. You have hurt us. [you haven't talked to me in 3 years. I hurt you because you didn't ask me about my life?] You have taken advantage of our generosity. [my parents asked to care for my children, I paid them and my ex paid them] You have been woefully, terrifyingly irresponsible in getting pregnant with your ex again. [another score for you, yes, it was irresponsible and it's horrible, but I have to make the best of it] This email is to inform you that we are not willing to open ourselves up to being hurt by you again. We are no longer willing to be taken advantage of. And we are not willing to assume responsibility for any more of your children! [I never asked a single one of you to take responsibility for my children... my mom asked me if she could and spent a full day convincing me] We have pleaded for years with you to make choices that will lead to you, your ex, and your kids living healthier, happier, safer lives and you have not heeded our pleas. [you have such a healthy concpet of health, you want me to adopt my child out, my children lose a sibling, my parents lose a grandchild, my child loses it's entirely capable parents. I'm sorry, when did your children become more important, more a member of this family than my unborn child. If I headed you pleas here, my life would be the biggest disaster imaginable then we could go on pretending to be merry and happy together so we can have feel good thanksgivings and christmases until I do something else that offends you and am threatened with excomunication again. I'm not the only sibling they excomunicated, my older sister wasn't welcome at family gatherings for a year and I was the only person who stood up for her, I said if she isn't welcome I won't come eigther. Of course, standing up for her meant I was trying to ruin the family] So now we are telling you that we will plead no longer. If you come back to this province, you will finally have to lie down in the bed that you have made for yourself. This doesn't make us happy, because we believe that one of the reasons that you have made such a messy bed for yourself is that you have a severe undiagnosed mental illness, [o_O] and for that reason, we still have compassion for you. But... you are not seeking treatment, you're not getting better. And we can't continue to deal with the symptoms of your mental illness when you are not dealing with the root cause. [these people are insane]\n\nPlease understand that, as much as we care for you, this email represents your last chance to make things right with us. [my... last... chance. No this email represents me ending our relationship taking my kids back, and possibly considering visiting you twice a year at some point in the future]\n\nThat was the end of the email\n\nSo what happened after? I failed 3 exams got poor grades on what I passed and failed 1 of my courses I didn't respond to the email all, on the 21st after my last exam I moved across the country to my ex's apartment because we decided that as inconvenient as it was to not have the time to build toward being together slowly, we had to do whatever it takes to get our kids away from these people before they try something shady. We found a place we could all fit in and moved in. I'm a stay at home mom I take my kids to the library, park, splash pad, play wii with them, colour, talk about letters and numbers and funny things and have a great time being a mom. That email crushed me like nothing ever has before and still hurts. None of these people have any concept of what they where demanding, or what they where saying about me. How can they have known me for this long and not one of them could stand up for me. Oh yeah, and follow up e-mails sent individually by each family member when they found out I was in the province and the emails their still sending have been just as horrible. My sister says, like it or not those are my kids too I put my life on hold to help care for them and now you won't let me see them unless you're there, you're using your kids as leverage to try and have a relationship with me that I'm not ready for. You took your daughter away from her cousin who was her best friend. Well what about taking their brother away forever? What about them seeing their mom and dad once a month if it where up to you? Their cousin is more important than those things? Some kids don't even know their cousins and their cousin happens to be the son of the man who wrote this horrific email to their parents. So no I don't feel bad about my 4 year old not being with her 5 year old cousin, who I've seen bullying her anyway, and is the family star. At my daughters birthday's her cousins been to, he's gotten as many presents as she did, but that doesn't happen at his birthdays. I think she can make friends at girl scouts and hockey fine enough and I'm going to high tail it out of here as far as I can.","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/offmychest/comments/3bp82v/my_family_disowned_me_during_final_exams_in_my/","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"My family disowned me during final exams in my first year of university when they found out I was pregnant","thumbnail":"default","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.offmychest","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1435713488","subreddit":"offmychest","media_embed":{},"edited":false,"score":0,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"created":1435717088,"subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3bp82v/my_family_disowned_me_during_final_exams_in_my/","secure_media":null,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"[deleted]","name":"t3_3bp82v","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"id":"3bp82v","num_comments":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false}

I have been to four sessions in the past with a different counselor, but I basically lied the entire time. This time I am promising to myself and my boyfriend that I will tell the truth.

So is my husband. We are coming up on our 15 year wedding anniversary (18 years together). When I was a teenager I got sick and as a result I was told I could never have children. I go months with having a period, when I do it's sporadic. I have gone years without ovulating. My husband was injured in a car accident as a teenager and told the same thing. When we got married we had both resolved ourselves to the fact that we couldn't have kids, so we doted on our nieces/nephews and have built a happy life.\n\nThe last month I have not been feeling well and (what I thought was) my stomach is always growling and I keep having heartburn. I often go visit my great grandmother, she is in an assisted living facility and over the last few months a bad stomach bug has crippled the staff, the residents and some visitors. My mom and cousin got it and I assumed I had it too. Except I don't. I'm pregnant. 2 rounds of blood work, 2 urine tests and a dozen pregnancy tests have confirmed. How in the hell this happened I have no idea. I mean, I know how, but I can't fathom *how*... I went for an ultrasound and based on the size and knowing my husband and mine's schedules (we work opposite shifts) we know it happened on April 1. Today I am 14 weeks pregnant. I haven't had a period in over a year, I weigh the same as I did on March 30 when I had my annual physical. I'm not showing even a little, I didn't have any morning sickness or anything until a month ago. I literally had no idea I was pregnant.\n\nMy husband and I haven't told anyone besides our doctor. I can't fathom how this is possible. We aren't upset, we are surprised. Happiness will come, but right now we are in complete and utter shock. I don't smoke, drink, drugs or do anything else that would be dangerous for me the baby, not for any \"pre-pregnant\" reason, but just because I like to live healthy. I keep thinking this a dream and I am going to wake up. Big changes are coming for us and we are NOT ready.\n\n(Edited for formatting)","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/offmychest/comments/3bp8cz/unexpected_pregnancy_very_unexpected/","title":"Unexpected pregnancy.

I have another situation going on right now. So I am a 30 year mother of two (17 m boy/5 m girl) and we are planning on having one more baby, we will start trying again next summer. \n\nBackground:\n\nI used to weigh 110 lbs before pregnancy, I am 5 ft tall. At the end of my first pregnancy I was 152 lbs, (boy 01/30/2014) two weeks after delivery I went down all the way to 118 lbs. I have never had problems losing weight, my body is just easy. At the end of my second pregnancy I was 148 lbs, and three weeks after delivery I was 126. Not so bad. \n\nThe issue: \n\nMy hubby and I hate condoms and we definitely cannot get pregnant again. We absolutely have to have a break for at least a year or more. Health reasons, I had two C Sections in less than a year. We really really hate condoms and that's how we ended up having our second so fast. I was breastfeeding so we were too confident. \n\nThis is my first time being on birth control and ever since I went on it I keep on gaining more and more weight. I weight 138 lbs and no matter what I do, I eat healthy, small portions and exercise 4 times a week for an hour and I still gain weight.  I haven't touch any dessert, I only drink water and some almond milk. \n\nI am also losing my hair and have acne like a fucking teenager.\n\nI tried different bc, and it still the same. \n\nI am starting to feel sad about how I look. I don't like what I see in the mirror. My hubby and I have a crappy sex life when using condoms because it is such a turn off. I can actually deal with it but my hubby really hates it. I want to please him but I really miss feeling good about myself.\n\nAfter I have my third I am going to have my tubes tied, since it will be another C Section then I will be all set. For now, I just rather not use any birth control at all, I would be okay with that but I feel bad for my hubby. He is wonderful husband, I am sure if I tell him he would be supportive of whatever I choose but I really feel bad for him.

I don't even know where to start with this, because this is easily the 4th time my life has been upended over the last 10 years. I have a pretty crappy and EXTREMELY rare illness; up until recently, it's not uncommon for it to have been terminal in 5-10 years or 12-15 if you're lucky. There is a new form of treatment at a major research institution in the US that has reversed the terminal nature of the disease in other patients. I wasn't holding my breath, because my luck is crappy, so I was prepared to die sooner or later. I was well past denial and into full acceptance that I was a dead man walking. Well, all the imaging that has been taken over an extended period of time has shown great response to the treatment (wish I could say more - NDA is pretty strict). The illness isn't going away, it will still be chronic and degenerative in nature, but it doesn't appear that I'm going to be six feet under any time soon thanks to the hard work of some intelligent human beings. I even have seen some effects of the disease reversing, which is great. I attributed it to certain other medications I take but I found out that it was actually the treatment in action. This is a great win for me and my family.\n\nI walked out of the medical office today a new man, but also totally confused. I made plans based on the assumption that I was a dead man. It feels like a total mindfuck, but also a huge weight off my shoulders. It's not entirely over, as I'll still be taking medications to improve my ability to move around and such, but the most worrying portion is no longer an issue according to the team of doctors I have. In the short term, I'm still planning to get most of my travel bucket list out of the way, because if there's anything this experience has shown, it's that life is too short. My advice to everyone - enjoy it while you can, because it can be over in an instant.\n\nAnyways, moving on to the core of this issue. I lost the last ~5-7 years to this disease, from the early undiagnosed stages, to now, and I don't want the rest of my life to be similar. I would prefer to avoid being lonely, and these past years have been super lonely. When I told my friends what my fate at the time was, most of them seemed to head for the hills. I guess it creeped them out, not sure, but they all stopped contacting me and responding in short order. No big deal, they have their own lives, but it really takes a crisis like this to show who your true friends are, which in my case, is one person who has gone out of his way to keep in touch. I actually was planning to leave all of my finances to him, unbeknownst to him of course, because I made some wise business decisions early in adulthood and I wanted him to live a somewhat worry-free life in exchange for the kindness he showed me. So, I wasn't entirely alone - but it was and still is pretty bad. I feel like I've been in a form of solitary confinement, if that makes any sense.\n\nMy highest priority right now, aside from gaining more strength, traveling, and hopefully getting back to work, is improving my physical appearance so that I can hopefully find my soulmate. It obviously slacked, I gained some weight, and my legs/arms/hands/face have edema from some heavy medications I was on - I'm now off some that caused it. I feel like I've been out of the loop for so long that I don't even know where I can go and meet new people. As you can expect, my hobbies are almost entirely based indoors because I've never really had the opportunity to experience the outdoors. I have a few questions, and please excuse my ignorance, but here goes:\n\n1. Will most women turn me away because I appear physically weaker or have a chronic illness (not contagious or genetic)? Tremors and such; think Michael J. Fox, but not quite as intense. I'm 6'3, so it's not that I'm a small guy. I'm also a nerd and super shy, I was a math major in college and my career choice is unsurprisingly super nerdy, so I was never the social flower - but it seems other nerds make it work.\n\n2. Does online dating work? I see commercials for eHarmony, but I've also heard horror stories.\n\n3. Is it common for folks to be single at 28 these days?\n\n4. I live in the party city of the US; Las Vegas. Going to the strip to meet people isn't all that great, considering most are visitors. I feel like online dating is the only solution in a place like this, but I could be wrong. I'm also considering moving elsewhere, where my search may be more successful. My education and choice of career pretty much allows me to get a job anywhere in the world and be paid extremely well - suggestions? I spent some time in the northeast, I really like it there, but I'm also open to other locations.\n\n5. Will relationships work if your immediate interests or hobbies aren't similar? Obviously my interests are somewhat narrow at the moment, so I don't know whether I'll enjoy their interests or not unless I was to try it.\n\nAny other advice you can provide on where you would start, would be appreciated.\n\nI apologize for the long post and any spelling errors (somewhat went past medication time writing this), I just wanted to acquire some feedback on this. I'm not sure when I'll start the search, but definitely once my physical appearance improves after I can start visiting the gym. I have some physical therapy to complete before that happens.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\ntldr - had terminal illness, no longer terminal thanks to new treatment, but still chronic. Looking for advice regarding where to start from here, in terms of relationships. Few questions above. I'd still suggest reading the whole post because most context won't fit in the tldr.","media":null}

I am in a 36-week program and only have 11 weeks to go before an unpaid internship for 180 work hours. So about 16 more weeks.\n\nThe college I go to is great and the people there have been very supportive. So supportive, in fact, that I'm wondering why I am going to this school at all now. \n\nI have always been interested in the entertainment industry and my dream job is to go work for a well-known talk-show. Here's the problem: I've been told internships are the way to go to get into that business. I'm not in school for anything that could be an intern on that talk-show.\n\nAdditionally, I know nobody in the industry who could help me out or give me advice. I am at a complete loss of what to do because my heart certainly isn't in my current educational career path.\n\nSome background on me: I'm 26 and took two years of general education at community college right out of high school because I had no idea what I wanted to do. After nearly failing because I was 18 and didn't care, I worked for a few years. I returned to school and got a one-year certification in web-design and that got me nowhere. I worked more crappy customer service-related jobs until now where I am going to school for something totally unrelated.\n\nI chose a career in the medical field because I figured it would always be in demand. I never pursued anything in the entertainment field because I feared failing and I was always told by my parents that it was not a smart way to go. I'm beginning to wish I'd just gone for it. Keep in mind, this is a conclusion I am having after many years and soul-searching. \n\nI'm good with computers and I would like to work for this certain talk-show as a digital media person. I currently do not have a portfolio. A one-year certification was enough to get my feet wet with HTML, CSS, Java and some knowledge of various Adobe programs. I'm mostly self-taught about Photoshop and After Effects now but I have no idea what kind of standard I should be aiming for.\n\nSo, here is a breakdown of my issues and I'm wondering how to handle them:\n\n1. Going to school for something completely unrelated to what I would like to do. Only have 11 weeks of class remaining then 180 intern hours.\n\n2. I'm now in debt to said college by about $20,000.\n\n3. I have no job right now since I am trying to finish out my education first. In other words, I have no money and as soon as I do it's going to pay back debt and for a car (since I don't own one of those either. That's how poor I am)\n\n4. I have no connections to the entertainment industry. \n\n5. I understand that a move to L.A. is most likely warranted (I live in Oregon atm) and I am cool with this. The show is filmed in L.A. But again, no money.\n\n6. I have no portfolio for digital media. What should I be focusing on? I'm willing to work at this and self-learn as much as I can to show employers I have dedication.\n\n7. Do I really have a chance of working for a famous TV show without an internship? Would I have to go to school for digital media and get in even more debt next?\n\nThanks for any advice. I am feeling so overwhelmed.","permalink":"/r/careerguidance/comments/3bpauj/advice_for_changing_career_halfway_through/","link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"author":"Arie15","from":null,"id":"3bpauj","archived":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_3bpauj","saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":0,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":2,"stickied":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3bpauj/advice_for_changing_career_halfway_through/","secure_media":null,"created":1435718617,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2t9i0","from_id":null}

I'm 6'3\") and while I was in I started packing on the weight. Our latrine had a scale and I would routinely weigh myself, all the way up to the point where I got up to 225 pounds in 4 months or so. We ate every 6 hours and had 10 minutes to eat as much as we wanted. And me, trying to gain weight, ate literally everything I could get my hands on. And we would do a bit of excercise too. My PT score would go up linear with my Weight. \n      But let's fast forward. I break my ankle on a ruck March and long story short I get an honorable discharge and what not. And I get home. I'm very excited to show everyone how much I can eat now, but the first time I eat real world food I literally can only take one Bite because I feel like I will throw up. And this goes on. I can't hardly eat anything without wanting to vomit or get headaches. And when I think I'm hungry, I'll be able to stomach a few bites but then feel so full I wanna throw up.\n       I don't understand this, it's anything I try to eat. Doesn't matter if it's cereal, steak, burgers, soup.. etc.. I don't understand why. I'm still being active and going to the gym and lifting every other day. So far I've been home for about 5 weeks, and I just weighed myself after eating my \"dinner\" of half a pork chop and two bites of mashed potatoes and I weigh 189 pounds. \n\nI am losing weight extremely quickly and have no appetite and it worries me. I can feel it in my body, see it in my face, my pants are starting to not fit...\n\nAnybody know what's going on or what I should do to try to reverse this?","media":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.Fitness","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1435715537","subreddit":"Fitness","media_embed":{},"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Losing weight Fast (bad)","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null}

I am looking for a partner here with the same lifestyle goals as me. I am quick-witted, intelligent and polite. Here are some of the traits I would hope my partner has and why:\nSubmissive - I often enjoy giving the softer sensations. Gently caressing my partner and driving her passions with my touch. I tend to get along especially well with Kittens - primarily due to their willingness to just stretch out in the sun for hours on end letting their owner stroke them.\nMy gentler nature also manifests in the traditional D/s power exchange dynamic. I take great pride and pleasure in guiding my partner in all aspects of life and nurturing her to her potential. I am usually very playful too. Littles tend to react best to these aspects of my personality but they also tend not to have the following trait.\nModerate Masochist - Despite my softer, caring side and posh English accent I am as much of a ravenous perv as the next Dom (...except with considerably more class). When my desires peak my actions and words become more vigorous and demeaning. Bondage, light pain and degradation get added to the mix. I don't want a partner who accepts this. I want a partner who needs this.\nHostess - I occasionally like to host kink-lite parties. Nothing hardcore and all very civilised. My girl would be someone who looks forward to our parties and knows how to be an excellent hostess to our guests.\nLesbian Domination - I like to watch my girl either getting dominated by a woman or doing the dominating. If you are going to reply I would like to hear your thoughts, desires and concerns on this subject.\nRelaxing - I indulge in a bit of pot and gaming occasionally and would really like it if my partner was the same. I'm wary of this request though because I'm definitely not looking for a heavy pothead who just games all the time.\nCareer - I am looking for someone who is not addicted to her career. I am 40 now and thanks to a successful career of my own I am not far from retiring comfortably. I would like a partner that would also be willing to stop working in a few years so that we could spend the time together.\nThat's about it. I'd be very open to speaking to anyone who fits the traits above. If you are interested in chatting then tell me a bit about yourself. What would you want in life that I haven't mentioned? What parts of my post intrigue you the most? What were you looking for when you started browsing this subreddit?\n","retrieved_on":1440638656,"ups":0}

Yeah, I can be really chill and I love to relax and make jokes but there are bad days where help is wanted and needed.\n\nThe whole post ahead is going to be a little dark so bear with me, it's been rough.\n\nWorking out is a big thing on my list I've only recently had the motivation to get myself back into particularly because I felt it was the best for my as a person and for someone else who did a great amount of convincing. I used to go every day sometimes twice a day up until I hit a really rough patch in my life where I no longer felt the motivation to go but here I am again going back every day for an hour or so trying to improve.\n\nI'm Luke - I'm 18, just graduating high school, and I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana. I may as well lay out of a few of the things I enjoy or at least enjoy at one point or another before I get into some of the darker stuff. I love music, I'm all about it and if I had the chance I would go with headphones in 99% of the day but sadly that's sometimes not an option. Just to give you a taste of what I listen to, it's diverse and a really long list that's only a small portion of who and what I listen to. I like a lot of Action Bronson, Schoolboy Q, Kid Cudi, Mick Jenkins, The Weeknd, Frank Ocean, Kanye West, ASAP Rocky, Lupe Fiasco, The Wombats, Tame Impala, Glass Animals, Blink-182, The Goo Goo Dolls, Radiohead, Pearljam, Chance the Rapper, Big KRIT, Danny Brown, Earl Sweatshirt, Mac Miller, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, Wale, and so on and so forth.\n\nI also love to write but not so much as I love music. I'll write anything; for me it's more so about stringing words together but if it's over a topic I love then it's all the merrier. I usually stick to papers and pieces but I'll occasionally write short stories and I love the fuck out of some poetry if only I knew how to write it well.\n\nI'm huge on movies and netflix. I'm a homebody or more so I prefer to be alone or small groups so it's only natural. I'm more the type to stay inside and watch a movie with one or a few friends and maybe have something to drink, smoke a little, have some great food and joke around. On the other hand, I also love my fair share of wild stuff. White water rafting, skydiving was amazing. Also big into just walking through woods and urban exploration. My two favorites movies I would have to mark down as World's Greatest Dad and Pulp Fiction and as for my favorite series? Well that's rough - I love the Walking Dead but more so because I'm a fan of the comics. Also love watching Daredevil and The Peaky Blinders.\n\nI guess this is where it gets dark and boils down to why I'm writing this. I'm alone. I just graduated high school and those friends I had are now gone. My family doesn't care for me which is a long story in and of itself but you can imagine a stupid 16 year old saying he doesn't believe in god to his Bible Belt Hollywood stereotypical Hellfire and Brimstone preacher for a father won't end all too well. I'm more or less the black sheep of the family now. Back to the friend situation, I was never to close to any of them but hey - we were friends. I was never good at closing that gap and really getting to know someone if they're a guy. Emotional shit and really connecting with someone and getting person with a guy makes me uncomfortable for who knows what reason. Either way I'm alone now and that's what it's been chalked up to.\n\nNow a lot more morbid. When I was sixteen I attempted suicide, I fucked it up. As you can guess, I've got depression. I was diagnosed with Major Depression Disorder when I was 15 and since then have tried seven different pills with six different combinations to no success. I've also got that coupled up with generalized anxiety. More or less, I'm just not okay sometimes. I'm also somewhat recently out of a relationship. I dated a girl for two and a half years. One day I woke up to a text to find out she was cheating on me with not one but two guys. She had two relationships over Facebook with guys who she hadn't even met before, something which left be shocked because she was essentially an angel in the sense that she was god-praising and all-loving and who winced when she cursed. This coupled with my other two exes and my dad has resulted in a lot of cheating in my life that I was the one who found out about and had to deal with.\n\nI guess what I'm looking for is someone who is okay with talking to me no matter whether or not they understand. It's not always going to be depressing shit. It may not even be sometimes, it really just depends on the day. I want someone who shares the habits and hobbies I do, maybe some of the music tastes. There's a lot more about me I didn't list here so it's worth a try if a few of those hit you. I just want a friend. You can PM me your Kik or mine is Savorg. A profile picture isn't necessary but I guess I want to know one way or another that you're real.

I am diagnosed with panic disorder and agoraphobia, however. I've asked numerous doctors about my tics, including in the ER and while going through the mental health system. Most doctors had no comment or would just say it's a side effect of benzodiazepines. One time a nurse in the hospital asked me if I abuse cocaine because I was sniffling so much. That really got to me because I've never done anything like that in my entire life.\n\nBasically, I developed tics back in early 2010 at around 23 years old. It started with a lot of snorting to clear my nose. I was taking Xanax then and I figured it had to do with that. At a point it got so bad that I was often having fits where my primary form of breathing became rapidly snorting while inhaling, then trying to quickly exhale before it started again. Eventually I switched to a slightly longer acting benzo and my tics became more of a sniffling and occasional snorting type.\n\nEventually I started wearing nose plugs to help suppress them and my brain adapted and came up with a new tic. Do you know that sound many people make that's sort of a laugh when something isn't funny enough to actually laugh but they make a sound anyway, kind of like a forceful \"huh\". \n\nWell, I do that constantly. Most of the time it's my primary form of exhalation. It's usually quite forceful and my lungs and all the surrounding muscles are in SO much pain because of it. My levels of anxiety in a day dictate how bad my tics are, but at the same time the severity of my tics dictate my anxiety.\n\nI take diazepam twice per day and it occasionally calms me just enough that the tics are much less frequent for awhile. But I am in absolute agony. I'm 28 years old and I don't leave my house. I'm legally disabled and don't live even a fraction of the life I lived before I got sick. I'm so terrified and I don't even fully know what's wrong with me.\n\nI try so hard every day to suppress these tics and I just don't know how. It's like trying to stop blinking or anything else that happens automatically. If anyone out there has any advice, I'd be so grateful. Anything to feel less alone and maybe even help with the tics.\n\nTL;DR: I have a tic where I force air out of my lungs making a \"huh\" sound, both through my mouth and nose. I can't stop it and it's ruined my life. I have never been diagnosed with Tourette's.

{"selftext":"My parents love me, and I didn't think that for a long time, but I realized I thought that because of the perspective I had. I'm 16 years old MtF (no one knows) and was sent home on the last day of Georgetown's Medical Institute camp from the hospital as a result of a DXM overdose. I've had a therapist for a few months because my parents found Adderall on me a few times. I've told him about some of my drug use but avoided others (opiates and benzos). I though I did that so that he wouldn't think there's too much risk as I'm not using anything too bad and because it wouldn't fit my narrative, in both my eyes and his. I know that if you use drugs to escape there's a problem, so I convinced myself and him that I use them for fun. I was so convinced that I truly thought I wasn't trying to escape. After the whole debacle of being sent home, my parents scheduled two visits to see him, one today and one Thursday. He asked me today flat out, \"what are you trying to escape from\". I didn't tell him, but it clicked in my head. I knew all along but couldn't admit it to myself that I'm doing all this to escape the reality that I'm afraid to tell my parents who I really am. My mom has told me several times she will love me no matter what and all that usual stuff, but what they say implies otherwise. I've heard her say things about gay people like \"I feel so bad for his mother\" and when my dad and I talked about Caitlyn Jenner he had a look of disgust the whole time, said she'll never be a real women because genetics, he said \"just look at him it's gross\" and when I tried to argue gender is in the brain, he just freaked out over where I'm getting my facts from. So since I came to the conclusion that I'm trans in the middle of 7th grade which was shortly after I started trying to smoke weed, I knew I wouldn't be able to tell them. They'd be too worried about my siblings I mean my dad showed a picture of his gay colleague to my 6 year old sister the other day and told her that the other guy is his brother.

I didn't see a whole lot of information on this sub about degenerating fibroids, so I figured I'd start a thread on it.\n\nI have two fibroids - fairly small ones, one 4cm and one 5cm, both located on the rear side of my uterus.  They're subserosal, which means they're connected to the uterus by a stalk, and not within its walls.  At my anatomy scan (it's going to be a boy!), they mentioned that if I started having any constipation issues, it would probably be due to the location of the fibroids.\n\nOn Saturday, I started having awful cramping pain in my lower pelvic area.  (Put your hand sideways, with your thumb just below your navel.  From the bottom of your pinky down, that's where it hurts.)  I thought it was constipation, gas, maybe the baby sitting weird, whatever, and figured I'd see how I felt on Sunday.  I did, however, remember what the ultrasound tech said about my fibroids, and found a [Babycenter thread](http://community.babycenter.com/post/a6688345/fibroid_degeneration_-_has_anyone_experienced_this) about degenerating fibroids.\n\nOn Sunday, the pain was actually worse.  I called the 24-hour nurse line, gave a description of my symptoms and what I was feeling, mentioned that I thought I had a degenerating fibroid based on my symptoms, and she advised me to go to the emergency room.\n\nWent to the ER, they had me do a urine test, which showed I was really dehydrated.  (Not sure how - I'd had 20-25oz of liquids since I'd woken up.)  I was just embarrassed, I'd never wanted to be one of those girls who panics at Braxton Hicks and goes to the hospital.  They did a fetal heart monitor (wand on the belly) and checked my cervix and sent me home.  No IV fluids, no blood tests, no ultrasound, no \"please follow up with your OB in the morning\".\n\nI'm enrolled in something through my insurance where a nurse will call every month or two to keep track of my pregnancy, and as it happened, my scheduled call was at 5:30pm on Monday.  I told her what had happened at the ER, that I was still in a lot of pain, and she was so concerned she told me to get off the phone and call my OB.  (So really, really - if you had persistent or consistent pain, call your OB!)\n\nSince it was after hours for them, they told me to call again this morning (Tuesday) and they would squeeze me in.  Went in this morning, and they did a more full-fledged work-up - urinalysis again, blood draw, cervical swab, cervix check, palpated my abdomen to rule out appendicitis, etc.  They concluded that a degenerating fibroid was indeed a reasonable diagnosis, and started me on Indomethacin for the pain.  That's taken the cramping pain down from an 8 to about a 5.\n\nSo, because it was difficult for me to find information on this outside of the Babycenter thread...\n\n* Degenerating fibroids can happen any time, but most often in the second trimester.  I'm 21 weeks right now, which is prime fibroid time.\n* Depending where your fibroid is located, you may be able to feel it externally.\n* For me, the pain is cyclical, usually with 3-4 rounds of horrible cramping (like really bad menstrual or gas cramps) at a time, each lasting about 30-40 seconds.\n* This does not hurt the baby in and of itself.  Extended periods of cramping may cause you to start having contractions, though, so get checked out.\n* The pain can last anywhere from two days to three weeks.  It's super-serious pain and according to the Babycenter thread, it's worse than labor.  (So now labor should be easy, right?)\n* Spotting is not uncommon, though I haven't had any.\n* They may or may not be able to confirm that the fibroid is degenerating with an ultrasound.\n* The recommended treatments are to start with ibuprofen or indomethacin.  Both are NSAIDs, so don't start them without your doctor's recommendation.  If those don't work, morphine, percocet, or darvocet can help - those don't cross the placenta barrier to the baby.\n\nIf you think this is happening to you, drink plenty of water, because it sucks to get to the hospital and get discharged for dehydration and have to go through more days of pain.  A heating pad may help (didn't help me).  Lying on your left side may help (didn't help me).  Chase down your OB even if it's after hours, they typically are more helpful and invested than the staff at the ER / birthing center.\n\nBut, I hope it doesn't happen to anyone!","media":null,"ups":15,"retrieved_on":1440638625,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/BabyBumps/comments/3bpg4c/ow_ow_ow_degenerating_fibroid/","from":null,"post_hint":"self","author":"sat0123","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":"","num_comments":2,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_3bpg4c","link_flair_css_class":null,"archived":false,"id":"3bpg4c","edited":false,"score":15,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s7cl","from_kind":null,"created":1435721385,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/3bpg4c/ow_ow_ow_degenerating_fibroid/","stickied":false}

Here is some things that have worked wonders for me, this is my own opinions and if your going to laugh or disrespect it just stop reading now. Keep in mind I am non religious and not a member of AA (not that there would be anything wrong with that)\n\nMost importantly, quit the self pleasures and unproductive time wasters which involves no one but your self. This includes, pornography, masturbation as the most important things to completely quit. I believe it drains your energy and motivation, even if you only do it sometimes before bed where you wouldnt be doing anything productive anyway, it still drains you of energy, motivation and confidence the next couple days. If your body is getting sexual release and stimulation every night, your mind and body thinks it is \"mating\" so naturally your brain is telling you, there is no need to talk to any women. remember that we are mammals and its part of biology. The sexual need and desire is an important part of our drive. So quit wasting it.\n\nDoing this alone you will find your self with much more energy. Now put it to good use, start working out, I actually want to work out when I abstain. You will find your self with a lot more \"push\" to interact with women. Doesnt mean you will be the ladies man all of a sudden, but you will find your self with an actual drive, to learn and take risks.\n\nBeing able to abstain is hard enough, dont try to quit everything at once. Do this first. But you could also try cold showers for an extra push. (completely cold no warm!) this will allow you to conquer your fear of not wanting to do something cause its uncomfortable, its just water it wont hurt you. You will get a rush of \"This is cold!!!\" And gasp for air, stay in for as long as you can. When you get out you will feel amazing and energized, ready to take on anything. \n\nAfter a while of going through these guidelines, I for once felt I had a want and a need to improve. I no longer felt like I just didnt have the energy or didnt care. It made me realize smoking cigs is so pointless, I hated the mental addiction more then anything, because its another time waster that distracts me, it lowers stress! Which when your trying to improve, you need stress for motivation! You can find relief in dealing with the situations or by working out, this lowers stress but in a healthy way that doesnt help you to just forget about it\n\nI managed to quit smoking with only two slip ups. No way I would have bothered quitting if I had my same old bad habits of pornography and playing video games. Not going to lie it was not easy I had terrible insomnia and went through a depression for a couple weeks but it was very much worth it.\n\nI first quit drinking, stopped my life from going in a downward spiral out of control. But I never felt like I was progressing and growing, just learning how to live and not actually ever taking off and progressing like I wanted. With these guidlines I am now finally doing just that. I urge you if your a single man in sobriety, feeling stuck, look into it, giving it a try is a start. But being dedicated and following through for at least a month will change your life. I urge you to check out subreddits about nofap, cold showers and working out. \n\nNo special words or wisdom is going to get you off your butt, challenge your self and I can say I tried everything to improve, supplements, ginsing, nootropics, motivation tools, making friends and trying to force myself to just do it. Never worked until I was dedicated to quitting the following above","retrieved_on":1440638591,"ups":6,"permalink":"/r/stopdrinking/comments/3bpioq/for_any_men_in_sobriety_who_feel_stuck_or_not/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","title":"For any men in sobriety who feel stuck, or not progressing or getting stronger","secure_media_embed":{},"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"stopdrinking","created_utc":"1435719077","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.stopdrinking","hide_score":false}

I was always a skinny guy growing up and used to be very active in high school  played hockey, soccer, skateboarded, really athletic to  say the least. \nAfter high school, I toured in a band and really got into music. With that came weight gain....I wasn't eating any different, but without hockey I was burning nowhere near the calories. Obviously boozing more too.\nI started getting into going to the gym about 2007 and started losing weight. Ended up losing about 30 lbs in 6 months or so. (Started around 215 ended 185-190 and I'm 6'2) so felt good! Ever since then I get comfortable and it's a roller coaster up and down in weight. \nI'm now around 220lbs with MUCH more muscle than previous years. I started keto about 6 days ago where, I  had been 225lbs! \n Either way I'm really pumped on this new endeavor and gave myself  the goal to be in the best shape of my life for not only for myself, but for my future wife who I love so much!

Before that I had a laminectomy on L5-S1 a few years earlier. Both times were emergency surgeries where I lost feeling from the waist down or use of my right foot. I had no choice but to have the surgeries.  \n\nOn my last post-op check in I was referred to pain management. They said my surgery is healing well but I am still having quite a bit of pain. I also have \"drop foot\" in my right foot which makes me unable to drive. I was in physical therapy for a few months but between the cost and needing someone to drive me constantly I had to stop going. I continue with the physical therapy exercises I can do at home &amp; also got a STIM machine. \n\nMy question is, has anyone gone through pain management with no insurance? About how much can I expect these visits to cost? I really don't want to be on meds long term but for now I still feel that I need something. I am still in pain doing daily activities. I try to get through it with ice packs, hearing pads, and over the counter meds.  \n\nI really want to visit my newborn niece but she is a 5 hour flight away and I'm afraid it will hurt too much. Sitting &amp; walking for long periods of time still hurts.  I was only hoping my doctor would prescribe me something short term to get through this trip. I realize I am going to have to deal with this pain but  it is even harder to manage while traveling. Instead I was referred to pain management which I am under the impression is a long term thing. I'm not sure I could afford multiple office visits. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on making a long flight more bearable? I wear an AFO on my right foot/leg to help me walk better.

It's been that way ever since I knew how to fuck up. I would cry-- I still do -- like a baby. He would tell me to stop, I had no reason to cry. Look at me now, I'm 21 years old. When was I going to start to respect myself? I don't know, I say, I'm selfish and I'm lazy. Does my word not mean anything?\n\nThis is not to say my father is a horrible man. I really do love him and admire him. Yet, now he says I only say it because I want his money. I have no idea why there's so much of me that continues to lie to him. He bought me a keyboard for my birthday when I told him I would stop smoking weed. I didn't. He paid off my credit card debt when I reached the max limit and I ordered another credit card. He lets me live on his farm in exchange for my minimal labor and I'm too lazy to put on sprinklers for the grass to grow. So, then what is it? Am I still, eight years later, bitter about my parents divorce? Do I still hold resentment for the times he put me down and slapped me across the face? I deserved it. I really did. I do now. I don't know what's wrong with me. I wish I did.\n\nWhy, when given more than most am I so ungrateful and I push the only man away who would ever take care of me? He told me, it's to the point he thinks it's better I get the fuck out of his life and stop sucking his blood. I do it over and over. I'm too low and he doesn't need those people around him. Maybe I should just go.\n\nI constantly think of ways to die. Maybe with a slight tug of the wheel, I'll drive into oncoming traffic, but I don't want to hurt someone else in the process. I'm too chicken to use my gun, plus think of the mess that would make. Then, I figured it out. Death by asphyxiation, I do love to be choked. The worst part is I think I'm too much of an actually pussy to do it. \n\nYou're depressed? He asks. He doesn't believe in depression. He doesn't believe in self induced mental illness. Why should he? His parents didn't care about him. He made a success out of his own. He worked hard. I've just reaped the benefits and fucked him over with my lies. But, why do I do it? There must be something wrong with me. \n\nWhen I was somewhere around eleven, in my parents bedroom, my sister and I were giving with my mom and dad on their bed giving them back rubs (not weird). I don't know where the conversation started but it was along the lines of my slouching because my father has scoliosis and I would get it too if I continued with my habits. \nHe said, \"You don't listen to me. You're fucked up. Say it.
