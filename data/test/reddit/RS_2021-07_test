I'm your supportive boyfriend who cooks and cleans for you and has your favourite wine ready. Your obedient boy who does as he's told and follows your lead. Who waits on you hand &amp; foot in front of both our friends, if you even still let me see mine. You push me around and even grope me at random times. I buy you presents and rub your feet at the end of each day. You force me to go down on you while you relax on the couch. That's right, you just grab my head and push me down there whenever you like ;)\n\n  \nBut no matter how hard I try, it's just never quite enough.\n\n  \nI'm looking for a dominant, Alpha woman to have a short or long term RP or even just chat with.  \nI'm 5'11, blue eyes, brown hair, slender but toned, tanned body. And I regularly get what's called a 'Manzillian' ;)\n\n  \nIf this excites you then PLEASE light up my envelope!\n\n  \nIf this is still up, then I'm still interested in playing together.\n\n  \n\\-J","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtykikpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2wtau","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dirtykikpals","subreddit_subscribers":448930,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"29 [M4F] Abuse me","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtykikpals\/comments\/ob9w0y\/29_m4f_abuse_me\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

But i cant stress enough that i feel fine. There's been good moments to but it has been a very \"if it rains it pours\" period of my life. In the last year or so however I've started to have cognitive problems. This post for example will take ages to type and i bet some errors still sneak through. I've typed things before and i swear in the moment it looks fine and then ill look back at it and its scary. Like a madman wrote it or i slammed my head on the keyboard a few times. Completely incoherent. I am forgetful and clumsy , ill go to press icons on the tills at work and ill miss them by miles. Repeatedly. There's times where i look behind me to read the deals to customers from the menu and ill just stare at it like errrr. The meaning and comprehension of what the letters mean just falls out my head is like I'm looking at hieroglyphs for a second. Now obviously these are pretty freaky things to happen i mean Jesus they're like brain tumour symptoms...but over lockdown when i was alone they reduced and went away. I've now been back among people and work , some of which are related to the bad stuff from before, for nearly 2 months and its starting again. It feels like my brain is a million miles away doing stuff elsewhere and the real things in front of me are suffering because they're running on back up power. Does that make sense? Is that even possible to be dealing with stuff subconsciously. Like i said i feel fine. I'm just getting frustrated. Sometimes i forget what I'm doing while I'm standing there having forgot what I'm doing.

We used to be close when I was a kid but now where not, I haven’t even came out to her (again) and I can’t imagine how much worse it will get. I’m not allowed to go to therapy becuse last time my therapist “influenced” me to think I was trans and she won’t let me go back to see anyone, I’m so tired I just want everything to be done I wish I had the guts to just kill myself but I won’t becuse I’m terrified of my mother finding out about my if I’m dead. I don’t know who I am I just feel like a shell of a person and I don’t see myself ever getting better. I’m so fucking tired. Lately her big jab has been about my weight. You’d feel better if you lost weight, you’d be happier if you exercised more. I have a stomach bug and she told me maybe I should just get up and do something. For background I am 5,5 and 180 pounds and I have chronic back and joint pain (we arnt sure why still hoping some more blood work will help) I can’t do very much physical activity without major consequences and she makes me feel liek shit for it. If I eat around her tells me to portion and if I portion I need to eat something healthier. I’ve taken to just eating at night or when she’s asleep so she leaves me alone. She thinks all my problems can be fixed with vitamins and medicine, I’ve been on 3 different antidepressants all having side effects, this one gives me horrible twitches and makes me paranoid she won’t believe me, it’s well you haven’t taken it long enough or well you shouldn’t have stopped taking it. I don’t have a job And she tells me dialy I wouldn’t be able to make it alone, I’m not prepared enough. She yells at me if I don’t keep the house clean while she sits on her ass, I’ve been her parent my whole life. The other day she told me “when you were little it was like having a grown child” and she holds that over me, if I don’t stay in line and do exactly what’s expected or just completely leave her alone it’s my fault and I’m acting out.

For years, I took natural DHT blockers like procerin, but they didn't quite as well, athough it helped slow it down. A few years ago, I was going to get back on fin but then read about post finasteride syndrome and didn't want to chance it. I think I'm somewhere between a NW3 and a NW4.

My life overall is pretty good, because my husband covers my support needs and I really like my current job, but I decided to get tested because if something goes wrong in my life, I would want to have my diagnosis already in place for whatever help I could get from it.\n\nFor the first year after it occurred to me that I might be autistic, I went back and forth on whether it was ASD or just a childhood with a mother who wasn't exactly abusive but seemed to think it was her job to make me \"tough,\" when all she really accomplished was shredding my confidence and invalidating everything I liked. I kept seeing that autism and that sort of childhood experience could look similar, at least from the outside. I also felt like most of my traits that seemed the most autistic didn't really show up until I went to college (my freshman year was incredibly stressful), and I understood autism had to be there from the beginning.\n\nBut then last year, after watching Hannah Gadsby's Netflix specials, I did a deeper research dive and found some of the subtler ways that autism can manifest in girls, such as simply moving dolls around a dollhouse instead of acting out scenes with them. Yup, this was me. I remember being low-key amazed when a friend would come over to play and basically create a whole movie on the spot. Sometimes I would try to do the same thing by myself because on some level I knew that's what I was \"supposed\" to be doing too, but I'd just get overwhelmed and kind of bored and give up. I also saw that autistic children's special interests could sometimes show up as reading a lot about something, but not actually doing the thing. In my case, around the age of 11 or 12 I was kind of obsessed with roller coasters even though I didn't enjoy riding them until I was closer to 15. I also was very much into space and dinosaurs; you know what adults don't think is notable and should be reported to a doctor? When a kid reads books about space and dinosaurs, and doesn't immediately become an astronomer or paleontologist at the age of 8. I also found that the ability to mask scales up with intelligence, and I was always a solid A student and memorize things quickly.\n\nSo finding those things out made me decide that there actually was a solid possibility that I'm autistic, not just a fragile introvert who was overwhelmed by college. After a lot of finagling, I got my test set up. Before I went, I typed up some of the things about myself that seemed to line up what I was finding online from autistic people's perspective, NOT the perspective of psychologists. The test went fine. Nobody questioned why I was there or told me that I didn't seem autistic. During the interview after the actual tests, he asked me some general life history questions, so I told him about some of the issues I've had with my parents. He didn't really ask me detailed questions about what behaviors I had that made me suspect autism, just kind of a generic \"why are you here today?\" I told him a few of my realizations about myself that initially sent me down the autism rabbit hole. I also gave him my typed-up thoughts about what it's like inside of my head, and he said he'd look at them.\n\nThen last week I saw that there were notes attached to my appointment in MyChart and I read them. He'd given me the diagnoses mentioned in this post's title. I believe these notes are intended for other medical professionals, not me, because he didn't really explain what the different parts mean. I won't flood y'all with the various numbers, but ultimately none of my \"subscales\" or whatever they are from the cognitive tests dipped below \"low average,\" and most of them were average or above. I think the idea is that there wasn't a big enough difference between my best and worst scores, and my worst score wasn't that bad. Instead, he basically pathologized being an introvert (booooo bad psychologist) and said I have anxiety in the presence of authority figures (OK fair). However, nowhere in his report does he reference the notes I typed up and gave him.\n\nI don't really know what to think about all this. Me feeling invalidated doesn't change the numbers I got. He didn't give me shit about \"not seeming autistic,\" but he also didn't look at my long-ass notes about what it's like inside of my head. I find a lot of the posts on the various autism\/Asperger's subreddits very relatable, and when I don't it's usually because it's 1) by a guy or 2) by someone whose autism is visible enough that they were diagnosed in childhood.\n\nWhen I fill out my timesheet on Thursday instead of the end of the day on Friday, it feels like lying because I haven't actually done my Friday hours yet. When there's a conversation happening with the TV on in the background, my ears have a very difficult time sorting them out from one another. When my (definitely NT) husband plays his favorite computer games, he doesn't continue thinking about them and looking up helpful tips\/YouTube videos about them during his free time at work; when I told him that's usually what I do when I love a game, he was very surprised. I can do eye contact when the other person is talking, but when it's my turn I usually have to let my gaze wander because it's too much work to keep up my end of the conversation and deal with the other person's face at the same time. My sensory issues are not disabling, but they are annoying in a lot of subtle ways that my husband apparently doesn't have to deal with. At this point I can read other people's emotions fairly easily, but I remember in my early twenties (before it occurred to me that I might be autistic) making a choice to pay more conscious attention to people's faces when I was confused by something they said, and even before then I had figured out there was a difference between social cues and emotional cues, and just because I was feeling empathy with someone didn't mean I knew how they wanted me to respond.\n\nThank you for attending my pity party. I'm going to talk to my doctor and my therapist about all this, but beyond that I'm not sure what to do next.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"aspergirls","subreddit_id":"t5_31zba","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/aspergirls","subreddit_subscribers":58970,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"So they diagnosed me with \"depression NOS\" and \"adjustment order with anxiety\"","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.9,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/aspergirls\/comments\/obabjk\/so_they_diagnosed_me_with_depression_nos_and\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I was looking at Thomas the Tank Engine videos on Early Youtube(Don't remember how that search went) when I stumbled apon a video of Thomas and Percy, when Thomas yells \"Ima Firin Mah Lazars\" and blasts Percy, leaving her face black and burnt. I think Thomas has a Troll Face, but I don't remember. This video scared me, and apparently some of my family remember my being scared. But then i was always scared, and whenever old,model thomas episodes came on, I would hide under my blankets. I'll leave attempted recreations on this post. I wanna find this video, and i hope you can help. I'm 16 now and I just wanna watch this video that scared me so many years ago.\n\n[https:\/\/media.discordapp.net\/attachments\/858061989532401724\/859955020182978560\/Untitled\\_drawing\\_50.png?width=456&amp;height=432](https:\/\/media.discordapp.net\/attachments\/858061989532401724\/859955020182978560\/Untitled_drawing_50.png?width=456&amp;height=432)\n\n[https:\/\/media.discordapp.net\/attachments\/858061989532401724\/859955042823569439\/Untitled\\_drawing\\_51.png?width=456&amp;height=432](https:\/\/media.discordapp.net\/attachments\/858061989532401724\/859955042823569439\/Untitled_drawing_51.png?width=456&amp;height=432)\n\n[https:\/\/media.discordapp.net\/attachments\/858061989532401724\/859955077078057000\/Untitled\\_drawing\\_52.png?width=456&amp;height=432](https:\/\/media.discordapp.net\/attachments\/858061989532401724\/859955077078057000\/Untitled_drawing_52.png?width=456&amp;height=432)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"tipofmytongue","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/tipofmytongue","subreddit_subscribers":1948638,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"old","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[TOMT](Youtube Meme, Early 2000's)Strange Thomas Meme that Traumatized Me","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.81,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tipofmytongue\/comments\/obaedv\/tomtyoutube_meme_early_2000sstrange_thomas_meme\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

My mom helped me open a Roth IRA when I was 17 (I had a $1,000 stipend from a high school internship). I started maxing out my contributions when I was 19 and had money left over from software engineering internships. I covered my living expenses during undergrad by being a teaching assistant. I’ve also had 7.5% of my wages from university taken out and put into their 401a plan. Most of my retirement is invested in Vanguard mutual funds.\n\nEquity if you're a homeowner: N\/A LOL\n\nOther investments: **$33,340.** Most of these are higher risk investments (crypto, single stocks, options, etc.)\n\nSavings account balance: **$9,125**.\n\nChecking account balance: **$19,423**. This is clearly too high. I’ve just been too lazy to transfer money over to my high (now mediocre)-interest savings account\/figuring out what to invest the excess in.\n\nCredit card debt (and how you accumulated it): **$0**. I put all my monthly expenses (except rent) on my credit cards. I pay off the balance at the end of every statement cycle.\n\nStudent loan debt (for what degree): **$0**. I am fortunate and privileged to have had my undergraduate tuition paid for by my parents (taken out as a loan on their home equity to be more specific). I was able to reduce costs for them by graduating in 3 years and covering rent\/living expenses for the last 2 years. My B.S. is in electrical engineering and computer science.\n\nNet worth: ~**$96,000**.\n\nAnything else that's applicable to you\n\nI think one common misconception is that you pay to get a PhD. For many fields (like computer science), a PhD is an apprenticeship -- your tuition is paid for by your advisor or a fellowship and you are given a stipend to live on -- it can be thought of as a job, albeit low-paying. So I will not be accumulating any debt for doing a PhD, rather I will be exchanging hundreds of thousands of dollars in opportunity cost (5-6 years of being a software engineer). Is this an even worse deal? Almost definitely. But one thing you realize quickly is that people doing PhDs are irrational and care a lot less about money… due to many reasons (privilege, wealthy families, passion, delusions of grandeur, etc.).\n\n### Section Two: Income\n\nIncome Progression: This will be a little messy, sorry! All amounts are after taxes.\n\n* Summer before college: I got a grant to intern at my state’s university in the cyberinfrastructure department. $1000 stipend for the entire summer.\n* Freshman summer: I was a teaching assistant (TA) for the intro CS class, which paid about $1700\/month. I was also doing unpaid research.\n* Sophomore &amp; Junior year: I was a TA again, I made $800\/month in the Fall because I worked less hours and $1700\/month in the Spring+$6k tuition reimbursement every year.\n* Sophomore summer: I interned at my research professor’s start-up. Took home ~$4k\/month.\n* Junior summer: I did research, paid $1-2k\/month ($15\/hr). Graduated.\n* Gap year: I continued doing research as an “R&amp;D Engineer I” and I was paid $3.8k\/month for 5 months (for weird HR bureaucracy reasons).\n* Summer before grad school: I interned at a large tech company, took home $5.6k\/month.\n* Now: I’m a grad student on fellowship, I get paid on average $3.6k\/month.\n\nMain Job Monthly Take Home: **$3,600**\n\nMy partner is also a grad student and takes home roughly the same amount, but he also receives a substantial amount from his parents every year. We have not combined finances and we split the rent, etc.\n\n### Section Three: Expenses\n\n**TL;DR:** my partner and I split rent evenly, he pays for electricity\/renters insurance\/groceries, I pay for internet\/most pet expenses\/entertainment subscriptions. We don’t keep track of who owes each other what (we’re lazy people haha).\n\nRent \/ Mortgage \/ HOA fees: **$975\/month**. Total rent is **$1950\/month**, split evenly with my partner. We live in a 1br\/1ba 500 sq. ft apartment.\n\nRenters \/ home insurance: **$20\/month**. Paid by partner.\n\nRetirement contribution: **$500\/month** to my Roth IRA.\n\nSavings contribution: At least **$200\/month**. But TBH a lot of money lives in my checking account waiting to be invested because I already have an emergency fund.\n\nInvestment contribution: At least **$200\/month**.\n\nDebt payments: **$0**.\n\nDonations: **$100\/year** to the animal shelters we adopted our cats from.\n\nElectric\/Gas: **$60-80\/month**. Paid by partner\n\nRenters insurance: **$20\/month**. Paid by partner\n\nWifi\/Cable\/Landline: **$35\/month**.\n\nCellphone: **$25\/month**.\n\nSubscriptions: **$42\/month** (Disney+, Netflix -- shared w\/friend, Nintendo Online, Discord Nitro)\n\nPet expenses: **$150\/month** (wet food, litter, toys, pet insurance, annual vet appointment)\n\nRegular therapy: **$24\/month**. My co-pay is $12\/session but my therapist often waives the co-pay. I pay $14\/month for medication.\n\nGym membership: **$0**. We run for exercise.\n\nCar payment \/ insurance: **$0**. Yay for decent public transit.\n\n**Disclaimer:** Although my partner (Sen) and I currently do not combine finances, the expenses reported below are essentially both of our expenses mainly because he doesn’t spend money on anything besides food or things we both need\/use.\n\n**Day 1 (Wednesday)**\n\n* 10AM — I wake up and roll around bed thinking about what to eat for brunch. I settled on a scallion pancake with an egg fried on top. I also munch on sliced almonds mixed with sriracha mayo. I know this sounds like a weird combo but it’s SO GOOD. I go on my phone while eating and order a phone case off of Aliexpress (**$4.08**).\n\n* 11AM — Research meetings. Our proof needs a lot of work and we’re probably going to end up rewriting it. UGH. I take a walk with Sen around 1PM to mail a present for a friend (**$5.98**).\n\n* 4:30PM — I help my friend with some graphics for her Twitch stream. I want to work on a widget that tracks game stats, so I decided to look into it tonight.\n* 5:30PM — I go for a jog. I woke up feeling achy earlier this week, which I took to be a sign that I’m not moving around enough… I take a quick shower after and think about what to eat for dinner.\n* 7PM — I finally decided to make brown rice and boiled eggs. While I wait for everything to cook, I snack on a banana tune into my friend’s stream now furnished with the new graphics! I peel my (very softly boiled) egg under running water and the water flings the runny egg yolk down the drain. RIP. I start boiling another egg.\n* 8PM — Finished eating dinner. I brush our long-haired cats, bribing them with Churu. It comes in a tube that you squeeze to dispense a purée for them to lick off. Churu tube in one hand, comb in the other, I brush out some knots and harvest a hefty hair ball from each cat. I don’t know what kind of kitty crack they put in this stuff but our cats go crazy over it and will tolerate being brushed. \n([Cat tax](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/uTVZjmD.jpeg))\n* 9PM — I start looking into what I need to make a game tracker and apply for the game’s API access. Also start fiddling around with After Effects.\n* 1AM — Bed time.\n* 3AM — Okay no more scrolling it’s actually bed time.\n\n**Total: $10.06**\n\n**Day 2 (Thursday)**\n\n* 10AM — I wake up filled with regret for sleeping so late last night. But hey, no meetings today yay! I eat the same thing as yesterday and browse through Reddit. I contemplate buying some trendy running shorts but decide against it. \n* 12PM — Start working, I’m going back and forth with another researcher about a bug, I work on replicating it and writing up details for them.\n* 7PM — Finish up work for the day and start cooking dinner, rice and salmon tonight.\n* 9PM — Finish up work (again) and start playing video games (Teamfight Tactics).\n* 12AM — I’m so bad at this game and decide to turn in for bed before I rage-sprint down the rankings omg. Video games are great free entertainment but potentially rage-inducing…!\n\n**Total: $0**\n\n**Day 3 (Friday)**\n\n* 11AM — Wake up, late start to the day but most of my meetings are cancelled and my coworkers are on vacation so I’m feeling pretty lazy too…\n* 12PM — Go to my one meeting, which is just catching up with a friend who is now an assistant professor at another university.\n* 1PM — Sen buys me a pizza from a restaurant that serves one flavor a day. I was excited because today’s flavor is my favorite: corn, potatoes, cilantro, and garlic olive oil. They also serve it with a delicious spicy green sauce\/salsa. I chow down on two slices and feel content. (**$26, paid by Sen**)\n* 6:30PM — I procrastinate on my run but finally go (with enough encouragement from Sen).\n* 7:30PM — I eat some more pizza, clearly I am very healthy\n* 8PM — We head out to grab groceries for the week at Trader Joe’s. We pick up chicken drumsticks (for congee), lots of fruit and veg, some snacks, a new candle scent (peach black tea), and key-lime kettle popcorn. (**$76.38, paid by Sen**)\n* 9PM — We brush our cats, bribing them with Churu as usual. \n* 10PM — I munch on the popcorn and it’s a little too sickly sweet for my taste but I continue snacking anyways. We watch some YouTube videos on our TV to wind down. We’ve been really into watching airplane ride reviews by Vicarious Voyager lately. His humor is great and we really miss traveling.\n* 12AM — I load the dishes into our dishwasher and clean up.\n* 1AM — Bed time\n\n**Total: $102.38 ($102.38 paid by Sen)**\n\n**Day 4 (Saturday)**\n\n* 12PM — I wake up. I love sleep and I love weekends. Saturday morning (afternoon?) intimacy ensues.\n* 1PM — I eat two more slices of pizza. The pizza just keeps on giving. I also order a grocery dolley on Amazon in hopes of making our grocery runs easier and pay with it using points I accrued on my Prime credit card (**$38.52**, $0 after paying with points).\n* 2:30PM — We take the BART (our area’s rail\/subway system) to the asian grocery store (**$4.20**). On our way, we walk through a shopping plaza and go to Petco to get algae wafers for our dwarf sucker fish. For some reason, prices are cheaper on the app and there’s also a cat toy I’ve been wanting to get that’s finally on sale. My introverted ass doesn’t feel like asking the cashier to price-match TWO items, so I place an order for in-store pick-up. ($7.76)\n* 3PM — We stop at Daiso, a Japanese dollar store. I LOVE Daiso; it’s just so fun for me to walk around and browse. I pick up vinyl zip bags for documents, a squeegee, a laundry bag for delicates, a pet hair remover sponge for upholstered surfaces (why not? hope it works), a scrubbing brush, lint roller refills, and candy. (**$15.23**)\n* 4PM — We arrive at the asian grocery and buy beef chuck (for beef noodle soup), king oyster mushrooms, more vegetables, roasted chicken wing flavored potato chips (why does Lay’s choose to release all the good flavors in Asia?), rice noodles, somen, and somen sauce (**$51.35, paid by Sen**). I open the potato chips on our way back and devour them. \n* 5PM — My Petco order still isn’t ready, so Sen heads home to unpack groceries while I go to Joann’s. I buy some cotton batting to use for making an ironing board cover (**$19.52**). I finally pick up my Petco order and head to the BART station.\n* 6PM — Arrive home and eat some snacks while we watch TV. I also light the peach tea candle I bought yesterday; it smells delightful! \n* 8PM — Make some congee (rice porridge) with the chicken drumsticks and ginger. I also start roasting potatoes and a head of garlic. Roasted garlic = one of the best things.\n* 9PM — Sen eats congee, I continue to eat pizza with garlic and green sauce. Sen has been trying to debug his tummy troubles so his diet is pretty plain right now (hence no pizza\/gluten). I promise myself I’ll eat vegetables tomorrow.\n* 11PM — Brush the cats again, harvest yet another massive hairball.\n* 12AM — Bed time!\n\n**Total: $98.06 ($51.35 paid by Sen)**\n\n**Day 5 (Sunday)**\n\n* 12PM — Wake up. (Finally) finish off the pizza for brunch.\n* 2PM— Half of our (gas) stove is not igniting. I suspect the pilot light went out. I open the stove and grab a qtip so I can transfer the flame from the working side. I end up smothering the other pilot light with the qtip — what a fail! Sen and I have a good laugh about it and he heads off to Target to buy a lighter (**$8.08**). While he’s gone, I decide to deep clean our greasy stove. \nSen returns and we relight both pilot lights. Our stove works now, woohoo. I feel accomplished about not having to file a maintenance ticket for this.\n* 3PM — It’s time for our fish tank’s weekly water change. I finally use the siphon correctly and vacuum up debris along the gravel. We finish up and return to the couch to watch TV.\n* 7PM — I try cooking king oyster mushrooms. I saw a video where the chef scored each half in a diamond pattern so I try to imitate that. It’s surprisingly easy and the end result turned out really nice. We eat the mushrooms with some congee and broccoli.\n* 9PM — I get on a discord call with some friends. We end up looking through old high school pictures. \n* 12AM — Bed time!\n\n**Total: $8.08 ($8.08 paid by Sen)**\n\n**Day 6 (Monday)**\n\n* 8:30AM — I wake up and eat a scallion pancake with an egg. \n* 9:30AM — I start feeling a bit cold and bundle up with some blankets in bed.\n* 11AM — Omg I fell asleep. I wake up and start working. My friends and I like to join a video call when we’re working, it feels less lonely I guess. Coping mechanisms for weird times.\n* 5PM — Finished with my day’s work and meetings.\n* 5:30PM — Eat a protein bar and venture outside with Sen. One of our friends went to Seattle for the summer and asked us to check if their car is still there (the joys of living in an urban area — high crime...) After we confirm its existence, we go off on a run.\n* 6:30PM — We finish up our run and I feel cold and sweaty. I realized that the protein bar I ate earlier didn’t have any sugar. I immediately slurp some congee and noodles.\n* 7PM — The AirPods I ordered on Prime Day arrive! My younger cat has a habit of jumping on my desk and ripping my wired earphones out of my ear so I’m excited to make the wireless switch.\n* 8PM — Still hungry so I help myself to some leftover roasted potatoes. \n* 12AM — Bed time.\n\n**Total: $0**\n\n**Day 7 (Tuesday)**\n\n* 8:30AM — Goood morning. I make some fake ground beef (“Beefless Ground” from Trader Joe’s) and scramble it with two eggs. I boil some somen noodles and eat a hearty breakfast with Sen (is it too early to call this brunch?) Everyone in the lab is taking a vacation (including my advisor), so I feel pretty relaxed today. \n* 11AM — I’m searching for a new face moisturizer (I have dry patches around my ears) and decide to order a sample tube of First Aid Beauty on eBay before I commit to a big tub (**$6.83**). Spontaneous nap time...\n* 1PM — I wake up from my nap and watch a friend stream a horror game (Visage).\n* 3PM — I draw a new emoticon for the same friend’s stream I made graphics for earlier in the week.\n* 4:30PM — The cats are getting hungry so we stave off their hunger by brushing them and feeding them Churu.\n* 6PM — Sen picks me up a poke bowl (**$15.86**). He’s a bit sad that he can’t eat one now since we can’t confirm whether it’s gluten-free or not. I propose that we make some poke ourselves (we have a local fish market nearby) this weekend. I bake him some salmon and asparagus while he makes brown rice.\n* 8PM — I make some tweaks to the emote I drew, resizing really loses detail ugh.\n* 10PM — My friend and I do our nails together (on video call). Earlier this year we both bought tools for gel nail manicures. It's more expensive than regular nail polish but it lasts a lot longer and it's cheaper than going to the salon -- [final result](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/gZJPZqf.jpeg).\n* 12AM — We start playing a new video game (Valorant).

I finished two paper deadlines at the end of May\/early June when I was putting in 60+ hour weeks and now I’m in “relax mode”.\n\nThe food+drink amount is normal for us. Even though we don’t eat out super often, we still spend a lot of money on groceries because we try to buy organic produce and meat whenever we can. We were on the lighter side for other expenses (sorry if that was boring!). We definitely spend a nontrivial amount of money on our pets\/entertainment\/hobbies about once a month; I just dropped $100 on a new fish tank\/lid\/tank lights today. A few years ago, I used to be very frugal (almost to a fault), but I’ve since become a lot better about being lenient with spending money now that I have a steady income and a partner who also has a healthy relationship with money.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MoneyDiariesACTIVE","subreddit_id":"t5_12n5pd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/MoneyDiariesACTIVE","subreddit_subscribers":52526,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I am 23 years old, make $48,000, live in the Bay Area (CA), and work as a graduate student.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.98,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MoneyDiariesACTIVE\/comments\/obageg\/i_am_23_years_old_make_48000_live_in_the_bay_area\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Be warned, it's a long 'un.\n\nSo I'm 27 right now and just recently, very recently, I find myself diagnosed with Aspergers, and I really don't know how to feel about it.\n\nOn the one hand, knowing this about me has been a very surreal moment of clarity. Everything that I used to do that wasn't considered 'normal' - echolalia, meltdowns, special interests that began in my younger years and never grew out of  - have a clear explanation. I'm not really an enept human being, I've been struggling against my own brain my whole life, and it's good to know that my slow development has a reason behind it.\n\nOn the other hand, I feel...sad. Because I've had no support in this regard throughout my life so far. I've always pushed against my struggles, but so far this hasn't landed me in what I call a 'good' position, especially when it comes to how my mental health has been a mess for years now. I've been back and forth with therapy and medication for depression\/anxiety but it never hit the root cause of the problem which is my struggle with my autistic side.\n\nI feel I am now basically a 'hermit' who spends most of his time isolated because I fear any and all social interactions due to the strain it puts on me mentally, meaning I have to shutdown and recharge for hours before I do literally anything else. Hell, even something small like a phone call in the morning can make me lose my luster for the day ahead. I've never been able to cope with change and that still very much affects me to this day.\n\nI've never been able to hold a job for more than a few months because my dysfunctions make it so that I feel unhappy, unfulfilled, alienated and sometimes incredibly burnt out. Relationships have always been either strange, strained, or just a no-go thanks to my stunted social skills as I cannot flirt, show interest, or even recognise when someone is flirting with me. I've only had 2 relationships that, again, have never lasted more than a few months because of my bad social skills.\n\nCurrently am trying to support myself and live on my own, but it's been taxing, especially when dealing with my own head. The big thing atm is getting this diagnosis at this age has made me feel like I've wasted my life circa 18-27. Like I've been struggling up a hill for that time and although I can find ways to work with this now and find a way forward that works with my ND self, I'll never get that time back. Feels like so much of my life has been eaten by a monster that I never knew existed, so many years wasted, and now I'm so far behind where I should be in life, in comparison to both NTs and other people with Aspergers who are functioning way better than I.\n\nNot looking for pity, not looking for advice, just wanted to write down my experience for people who may understand can see. I only hope things get better because thoughts of 'it's too late for you' are beyond the point of creeping.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"autism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhs6","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/autism","subreddit_subscribers":186837,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"A 27 year late diagnosis...and how it's affecting me.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/autism\/comments\/obagk5\/a_27_year_late_diagnosisand_how_its_affecting_me\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I am a former Catholic and I am now a born again believer. I was raised Catholic and was a committed Catholic for most of my life until I gave up my former beliefs and embraced the gospel at 28 years old, five years ago. I am 33 now. I believe in the five Solas. \n\nThis past Sunday, my childhood priest (pastor) was retiring after 29 years at my old Catholic church. That was his last Mass. My father (still a devoted Catholic) wanted me to go badly, so I attended. It was my first time attending Catholic mass in five years. \n\nI decided to be respectful, and sit, stand, kneel, and sing when everyone else did. I'm used to upbeat Christian guitar bands and I didn't miss the organ at all to be honest. The mass was more about commemorating this priest than about prayers to Mary and the Saints. **Of course, when they said those prayers to Mary and the saints, I didn't say a word.** \n\n**The conflict came up when it came time to receive catholic communion.** My father asked me to go up and receive it. I reminded my father that according to Catholic dogma (such as [Canon 844](https:\/\/www.vatican.va\/archive\/cod-iuris-canonici\/eng\/documents\/cic_lib4-cann834-878_en.html#BOOK_IV)), I cannot receive the catholic Eucharist.

I am a former Catholic and I am now a born again believer. I was raised Catholic and was a committed Catholic for most of my life until I gave up my former beliefs and embraced the gospel at 28 years old, five years ago. I am 33 now. I believe in the five Solas. \n\nThis past Sunday, my childhood priest (pastor) was retiring after 29 years at my old Catholic church. That was his last Mass. My father (still a devoted Catholic) wanted me to go badly, so I attended. It was my first time attending Catholic mass in five years. \n\nI decided to be respectful, and sit, stand, kneel, and sing when everyone else did. I'm used to upbeat Christian guitar bands and I didn't miss the organ at all to be honest. The mass was more about commemorating this priest than about prayers to Mary and the Saints. **Of course, when they said those prayers to Mary and the saints, I didn't say a word.** \n\n**The conflict came up when it came time to receive catholic communion.** My father asked me to go up and receive it. I reminded my father that according to Catholic dogma (such as [Canon 844](https:\/\/www.vatican.va\/archive\/cod-iuris-canonici\/eng\/documents\/cic_lib4-cann834-878_en.html#BOOK_IV)), I cannot receive the catholic Eucharist.

This is my first time living alone. When I first moved in, I connected my household water, electricity (Energy Locals) and gas (Powershop) with no issues. In summer my electricity and gas were about $25-30\/month each. My most recent electricity bill was $80 but that's because I was stupidly using the wall mounted fan heater every night in winter, and I've since got an oil column heater that I'm hoping will be less expensive to run.\n\n2 months ago I got a letter in the mail saying I needed to also set up a hot water gas account with AGL. When I called up to inquire, I was told I would not be charged for usage previous to setting up my account, since this bill was new to the building (lucky me). I do not have the option to change providers as the hot water gas was installed and maintained by AGL.\n\nI got my first bill today. It's $87 for 45 days, or $1.94 per day. This seems outrageous to me, as an extra bill on top of water, electricity, other gas, internet, and considering I am 1 person living alone. I'm thinking of my hot water usage and I don't think it's excessive. My showers are about 5 minutes (15 if I need to wash my very long hair, about twice per week). Most days I take only 1 shower, but maybe 2-3 days a week I will have 2 showers a day. I use only cold water for washing my clothes and linens. Hot water for washing dishes though if they are not too dirty I will use cold as well. I didn't think any of that would count as above average use.\n\nIs this within a normal range for a hot water gas bill every 45 days? If not, are there any ways I am missing that I should be doing to reduce my usage?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AusFinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2uo3q","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AusFinance","subreddit_subscribers":322972,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Average hot water gas bill?

And I enjoy watching sports just as much, everything from gymnastics, to ice hockey, and American football! I also love baking! Cookies, cupcakes, tiered cakes, you name it a bake it! In high school I studied space science (high school over here is way different, basically like a light version of college haha), so I'm also really into science. 🤓 Well, that's a bit about me!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","subreddit_id":"t5_2tx47","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","subreddit_subscribers":178299,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[INTRO] 27 y\/o Swede","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon\/comments\/obarl2\/intro_27_yo_swede\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Turns out I also have a bad UTI and a yeast infection, which may be why the vomiting is so bad and while I feel so so terrible. \n\nIt was a frustrating day because it started at my fertility clinic for my ultrasound (baby looks great and we could even see the brain on the scan which was so cool). Afterwards the NP comes in to check in and say the scan looks great and ask if I have questions. The fertility clinic is amazingly helpful (I mean they got me pregnant and were so wonderful and supportive throughout it) but clearly the after getting pregnant part isn't their strong point and everytime I ask questions they say hm we'll have our nurse message the nurse at the OB clinic. And meanwhile I keep trying to get into the OB clinic but I don't \"graduate\" the fertility clinic and go to the OB until second trimester. So the NP comes in and I am telling her about all the vomiting and she is like oh its ok as long as you don't immediately throw it up. And I say I do, or I throw it up exactly 6 hours after taking the unisom. And she's all its ok as long as you are functioning, and I say I am not even remotely functioning I haven't worked in days. So after more back and forth and her saying I shouldn't take any prescription nausea meds she says well maybe just go to the ER. \n\nSo the ER\/hospital is connected to the womens clinic by a bridge. And I walk over to the building but find out because of covid I can't get down to the 1st floor where the ER is I have to go outside and walk around. So I say fine, start walking, stop and start puking (lucky I carry puke bags). Then I sit down a minute and the patient services person who told me about the ER took pity on me and said she'll arrange for an escort to come get me and take me to the ER. So I am sitting there dry heaving because there is nothing left to puke and the patient services lady comes over again and says I am so so sorry but the other workers (she means patient services people at the information desk) want you to move to a chair in the back of the lobby so they don't see you puke. In her defense she looked like she wanted to cry telling me this so I obliged. \n\nThe ER visit was OK enough I guess. The doctor did make a point of telling me I wasn't \"that dehydrated\" per my urine and it seemed like a \"so why did you come\" sort of statement. Meanwhile I am dry heaving while he tells me this. Then he goes on to tell me about the bad UTI and yeast infection. So ok... sounds like I did need to come in? He also says he can give me a shot of zofran but can't prescribe me anything for nausea because I'm pregnant. \n\nSo I leave the ER and call the OB clinic and try to explain to the receptionist I was just at the ER and they said to check in with my OB but I haven't met my OB yet and I have questions and what do I do. She didn't know and said she'd call me back. Three hours later I call the OB again and transfer to the nurse line and explain all this to a nurse (including how I haven't graduated from fertility clinic to OB yet but they aren't great with pregnancy questions) and she took much pity on me. She also was skeptical I have a yeast infection since they only took urine from me and didn't think that was reliable. She also said don't take what the ER prescribed you for the UTI and yeast infection and called in new meds. She also said you definitely need prescription nausea meds, they will make you tired, but take them every 6 hours anyway because you can't keep landing in the ER from dehydration. Finally someone took control over my care plan!! She also said someone just cancelled an appointment and gave it to me bumping up my first OB visit by 3 weeks. I was really stressed out that no one seemed to want to be in charge of me or give me any sort of definite solid advice, but I feel much relief that my OB's nurse is ON IT even if I don't meet the OB for another month. \n\nAnyway.... the nausea meds are helping! I definitely ate and drank more this afternoon then I have the last three days combined. I am about to drink a big tall glass of cranberry juice that I am reasonably confident I will not throw back up. Though my head is absolutely killing me. I don't know if its the UTI or the residual dehydration but such a throbbing headache. \n\nWell this turned into quite the rant... thanks for letting me dump it here.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"pregnant","subreddit_id":"t5_2qwzb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/pregnant","subreddit_subscribers":131295,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Second trip to the ER this month... just wanted someone to be in charge of my care...","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.94,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/pregnant\/comments\/obarm5\/second_trip_to_the_er_this_month_just_wanted\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

That's why I am making this post: I highly value connection and would love to forge it, even if that connection is fleeting. I look for those experiences that evaporate the sense of the past and the future, experiences that totally submerge one into the present fully. For one reason or another, please my partner, sharing that intimate, climactic moment, manages to plunge me into the present moment unlike anything else, and my genuine goal is for of course my partner to feel the same way, if not more! I want to create an indelible memory with you. \n\nConcerning physicality and preferences: I am 5'7, white, very fit, short cut and blue eyes. I prefer my partner to be fit as well however I am far more concerned with the chemistry between us, so any physical preferences are absolutely flexible. \n\nAnyways, I will be in town from late Friday night to Monday morning.

For some reason I later 'confessed' to bring in a similar scenario only it was in a park and by an anonymous person. She believed me and I never told it to normal people in my life but the story is long, elaborate and burned into my mind I guess in an attempt at looking for sympathy. \n\nI regrettably continued the story with my next serious girlfriend as well as the details to go on with.\n However the story has become so real to me after thinking on it I have had ptsd attacks and night terrors all revolving around this night in my life that didn't happen. I feel very strong guilt but still find it difficult to not want to tell people. I have avoided telling anyone else outside of my exs and some friends who i know would have forgotten by now. Since getting in a new relationship with a girl who has had groping stories I find it difficult to not want to tell her as my own story has now made a direct impact in my life and how I perceive things to the point it feels real and has happened. I'm 21 soon and feel so much guilt and have a constant fight in my head about it all giving myself lots of stress over something only I and possibly 1 other person still remember.\n\nI need to make it clear I have not made anything else up and have owned up to others about being a compulsive liar in the past. It's probably clear I have suffered a lot of mental health issues over the years some of which still plague me today, hoping confessing will ease my guilt a bit. \nI'm aware it's a not okay to have lied about in the first place which is why I have immense regret of it in the first place and I am unsure how to forget or live with it.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"confessions","subreddit_id":"t5_2qq6g","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/confessions","subreddit_subscribers":951311,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I lied about being assaulted to my ex when I was young","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/confessions\/comments\/obb4x0\/i_lied_about_being_assaulted_to_my_ex_when_i_was\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}
