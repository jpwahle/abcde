I'm 22 now. \nI don't regret smoking, but I do regret the person it made me turn into. I was regularly attracting people that only wanted me for the weed I provided. I was a heavy user. I smoked blunts regularly and spent at least 400 dollars a month on weed and smoke it all up to where I'd need a front by the time payday came around. It was like I was throwing all my money into my problems expecting them to fix themselves. I work in fast food, and had no business spending my money like that. \nBut now on day 7, those empty friendships that revolved around getting high are nowhere to be seen. Its even harder because the friends that are sticking around make it sound like I'm just taking a tolerance break. But its deeper than that. \nOn day 7, I'm more present, more than I have been in years. My body dysmorphia isn't nearly as bad, my anxiety isn't nearly as bad. I convinced myself for so long that weed was the only outlet that could pull me out of my depression when in reality it pushed me deeper. In the brief moments of clarity I had when I didn't smoke I almost felt relieved, and it scared me. I was scared of myself because I had been smoking for so long- I didn't know me anymore. But now I'm back, and I missed myself. \nIf it feels like it's too much, then it's working. I missed out on years of emotional work but I've got my whole life ahead of me now.

I know how beneficial libido can be, what a motivating force it is and how wasteful it is to snuff it out, I know the shame that accompanies PMO, the hiding and sickness, I know that stunting testosterone and wasting time are so foolish, but whenever I feel the urge I just lose all reason and figure one time won't hurt. I know better and am determined to do the right thing. A few months ago I made it to something like 19 days before I figured I was cured of addiction and could just use PMO occasionally, and it was right back down the rabbit hole. I didn't even make it to 90 days just to see what happened, it might've been the best decision I ever made, sacrificing immediate gratification for who knows what. Today is my 3rd day, and hopefully the 3rd day in a new PMO free life. I love how dedicated the community is to seeing each other succeed and I hope I can contribute and benefit.

From when I was about 11 to 12 years of age I was masturbating to porn and attracted to women. Recently I found trouble getting hard and an attraction to women since it just doesn't give me pleasure as it used to give me. Now I began to think to myself is it a possibility of me being gay so I started to watch gay porn, for the most part I had no reaction to the sex of two men committing sexual advances except for one part feminine men who usually have the body shape of woman (petite woman in my case) getting banged. For my insight I am 18 years old now and wondering what is my identity sexually but I also think varying factors are at play. For one From age 11 to now I have been watching straight porn on the daily and jerking off to it now suddenly its hard for me to even get turned on by it.

My darkroom photography teacher also showed me how to mix the chemicals. \n\nSo far just for chemicals and equipment for developing film only, I'm looking at about 160USD. I actually have this money right now, but now that I have a job I would like to save up and buy everything together. The main issue for me is the enlarger. I don't know how I would feel spending 1000USD on an enlarger, which is the average price I've seen them for when working. Although if I spend 300USD on a broken one, there's no guarantee I can fix it (I'm a photographer, not an electrician.)\n\nSo, specifically I have two questions: \n1. Is there a way I can get a working enlarger for fairly cheap?\n2. Should I just stick with developing only film for now and scanning them?\n\nAny other advice is welcomed and very appreciated :)\n\nEDIT: I probably should have specified a few things. I plan on working with only B&amp;W 35mm for the time being.

It's been somewhat of a safe haven for me. Here and relationshipadvice sub has helped me greatly. Back in college I would seek potential advice from subreddits such as this one when I needed help from people regarding my heritage, mental health, and relationships.  I feel the need to tell my story.\n\nIt began when I started dating my college ex. She ended up cheating with me with a coworker after moving to the DMV for work. I found out after getting ghosted for more than a week. This was my first real relationship ever. I grew up mostly around women, as an only boy, with lots of sisters and aunts in my life. I was bullied for most of my life, elementary school, heavily in middle school, in high school I was able to find some genuine friends. Most of my life I suffered from being the big fat kid. I was always big for my age, but I was also obese and had terrible halitosis. I had maybe 2 sets of clothes and wore the same thing everyday. My family was poor. My dad earned maybe 20k\\~ a year to support my sisters and I in nyc. My mother was out of the picture, living in China. I would maybe see her once every couple of years for a month or two. she eventually spent a decade in prison(this is another story for another time) before I saw her again in 2017. Thankfully my grandparents were around and we lived with them and were able to collect some money from rent. I was able to meet some friends in high school that were great to me. And unfortunately as I regret now, I lost contact with them after moving to college. I realize that this has always been one of my greatest mistakes. Me failing to maintain genuine relationships that I once had. \n\nShe was my first love of several to come, but I realize that she was likely the love of my life. I visited her once when I went to the DMV, coincidentally I was going to be in DC. I took a ride down to Virginia to visit her. She had moved on, and I couldn't be happier for her when we talked in person. Despite her cheating on me, I didn't blame her. I was a terrible boyfriend. We dated twice, for about 3 years in total. The first time I broke up with her and I ghosted her. Completely crushed her. And within the second time I failed to be a responsive boyfriend. I used to do things like yell at her in league if she was playing bad. I used to lie when she asked if she could stay over, saying it was a  bad idea. And small things like this never repaired itself when we were in our second chapter of our relationship. I was going into my senior year, I had graduated with a 2.6 GPA. I had a bleak outlook for a future, so I focused on completing my final courses. I broke up with her since she was a year older and graduated ahead of me. I didn't have time for her. She forgave me for this when we got back together but things weren't the same. At this point I was suffering from a mysterious **brain fog**.  It felt difficult for me to concentrate at times, and I didn't feel as 'sharp' when I was critically thinking. More on this later.\n\nI embraced her one last time and came back to NYC. I told her I forgive her. I sat depressed for a while, on a mini vacation, my first few months after graduating from college. I vowed that I would Eventually met a girl on EME (eastmeeteast), and we talked.. a lot. Dated for a bit, she was too young for me(just turned 19 entering college) and also lived way too far. And our paths were at different spots. At this point I felt the need to prove myself. I always made excuses for everything, and I kept telling myself  'I was always a bright kid', who could have gotten into harvard if I wanted too. Could have dated this girl and that girl if I had the balls to ask them out. And this was the type of mentality I had for years, until recently. I began spending a lot of time in the gym, and I was getting physically fit; in the best shape of my life. I was still a bit fat, pre-diabetic, but I was increasing my stamina tremendously and had started to develop some confidence. And even better I had gotten some job offers! 5 to be exact. I accepted my first one as a software engineering consultant working with big banks to facilitate their data process'. Salary: 50k in nyc. Sucks but I couldn't hope for better as someone with a 2.6 gpa from an average school with no experience or projects whatsoever. And it was a good way to get my foot through the door I ended up applying to over **1000 jobs.** Anything I could find. Went to dozens of networking meetups to get connections. And it finally worked out.\n\nI began working on 2018 and definitely learned a lot. Industry is no joke, and I wasn't even at a top firm. I saw a friend and someone who joined with me get a promotion and that gave me a lot of drive. I was happy for him and I knew I wanted more and could achieve it. Better job; more money. Eventually the brain fog symptoms began to feel more prevalent. I couldn't go to the gym anymore. I would have these migraines when I would be running on the treadmill that would cause me to get dizzy. Or even worse, if I was doing an exercise like an overhead press... I opted to get at home gym equipment instead. Eventually all the hard work paid off in 2018. I had gotten a fulltime offer with the firm I was actually consulting for. I left my consulting firm to join them on a quant trading desk. Something very data driven. where I could apply my background in computer science and engineering. My salary and benefits had increased threefold overnight. And I had a great outlook on life at this point. \n\nIn 2019 I had some of the best times of my life. I dated another girl who I fell in love with. Things didn't work out but we ended on good terms. This is when I should have learned that being friends after a serious relationship is almost impossible. Too many feelings and time invested. Also I lost key relationships with friends and someone I used to mentor. I have this tendency to focus too much and neglect several key people in my life for the person I'm dating. And this has been one of the biggest lessons I've learned. Also my symptoms had started getting much worse. I was feeling nerve pain, and atrophy in my muscles. I couldn't lift weights anymore, even if they were at home weights, and fairly light. Even now I struggle to lift groceries, I feel pain in my shoulders and forearms. I started seeing the doctors a lot more. Starting after college at the end of 2017 until now I have seen probably 10-20 different doctors. I have lost count at this point. Mostly specialists. In 2019 it still wasn't as bad as it was now. \n\nI had some of the best vacations ever. I went to thailand, singapore, japan as well. I developed a love for traveling. I had a great time meeting people at hostels, hotels, hooked up with several people even. I finally felt at this point in my life I had succeeded the goal I set out at the end of 2017. To make my college ex regret cheating on me. I had also gotten lasik, which in my opinion was the best decision I have ever made. It was incredible and I only wish I had gotten it sooner. By the end of 2019 and 2020, I dated a girl who I would eventually introduce to my parents. But just to save the story on that (it's very long), things didn't work out, my parents and her family had a spat. It ruined the relationship between me and her. And also I had my symptoms come along again, but this time even worse. I lost my ability to perform. I couldn't satisfy her anymore. The nerve pain I had been experiencing had crept to the rest of my body. I couldn't maintain erections anymore, and our lack of sex life and diminishing relationship destroyed me physically and mentally. And I've lost almost all nerve sensitivity down there. I strugglied to communicate this to her. She became what I thought was my best friend. And despite her 'willingness' to want to remain friends I had known that this wasn't a possibility anymore. I wanted to travel anywhere to get away from it all, but covid happened and that's where I'm at now. This brought me back to a dark place that I've only been in 2017.\n\nAnd now I feel like all my problems are catching up to me. My estrangement from my family. Having no true genuine friends left. Being put on medication and knowing I can never start a family or be my old self again. And more importantly, being in a dead end. Stuck with an ideopathic disease I've been trying to figure out for the last 3+ years of my life. I spent countless hours undergoing dozens of tests and exams, paid in blood, and literally tens of thousands of dollars later, with no clear results. I try to maintain the relationship I have with my sisters who I am still close with, but it isn't the same anymore. People as they get older move on, and it's difficult for me to have the same support level than when I was just their baby bro. I struggle looking at myself in the mirror, only to find a man who's 25 but can look 45 at times. I think about ending my life all the time. But I find myself backing out, out of my fear of death and the fact that I would break the hearts of my family; specially my grandfather and my sisters whom I love more than anything. What hurts the most is their negligence when it comes to mental illness and disease. And I've been trying to figure out if that is a byproduct of asian culture; because we are taught not to be this close with our parents or grandparents. We can't talk to them about certain things like mental health or sex for example. I think about my uncle who died 2 years ago now, at the end of 2018. His parents had forced him to get married and he committed suicide.  \n\nI've begun to blame a lot of people in my life such as my mom and my grandmother. People who were negligent of my well being and have been psychologically abusive in the past. People who have denied the existence of my health problems. I've spent the last year blaming them for interfering in relationships my sisters and I have been in, not investing in our well being, and not understanding asian-american youth. And then I realize that none of this matters anymore. Every other night I cry myself to sleep knowing that there was a point in my life I went completely wrong when it came to my health. I think \"maybe I could have gotten these procedures done sooner\" or \"maybe I could've gotten these tests done\". And I think about these regrets I built up throughout my life. My inability to approach women early in my life. My spending too many hours playing computer games. My lack of care when it came to my health in high school or college. And now it's negatively affecting me in the worse way. I take painkillers every night as well, that my doctor has prescribed to me to manage my nerve pain. I think about swallowing them all with a bottle. And then I contemplate whether or not I have the guts to go on with it.\n\n**I finally had it all.** I really did. And I lost it. After working out and getting my lasik, I had tremendous confidence, I was no longer the big fat kid with raggedy clothes, and body odor. (I'm 6'1 1\/2, \\~190lbs as a reference. I went from having the best year of my life in 2019 to a soul crushing 2020. I'm finally making more money than I can spend, living in manhattan, and have the luxury to travel anywhere I want. On the surface my associates\/friends right now think I'm living my best life with no problems. But deep down I don't know what is next for me. The only thing I feel like is keeping me alive is knowing that I still have family members who would be devastated if something happened to me. That and the fact that I can at least enjoy things like good food and spending time with my nieces and nephews. And I can keep my mind occupied with hobbies like photography and golf. I'm scheduled to have a surgical biopsy done sometime early 2021 to do more testing. And at this point I don't know if I want to anymore. I think the only reason I wrote this post is because I saw my baby nephew and sort of see him as my son or the little brother I had always wanted growing up. A part of me wants to guide him to the best in life that I didn't have a chance to have growing up in my dysfunctional household. Especially knowing now I will never have kids. I have lost control of my body, and I believe I will also lose control of my ability to think clearly. I just don't know when.\n\n**TL:DR;** My life has spiraled out of control in 2020. In 2021 I only hope that I am still alive. I spent a lot of time here reading other people's stories and relationship advice throughout the years for which I am grateful. Although most of the advice I read online is about dating and school, my biggest advice I can give is that early maintenance of health is the most important thing to set us up for a long life; it's something we don't think about at all when we are young. I'm 25 and don't feel optimistic I will get to 30. I feel as though the best years of my life have been robbed from me. My relationships with my family, friends, and lovers have been greatly diminished, and seemingly non-existent anymore. If there is one piece of advice I could give is: to make sure you floss your teeth every day. I am not kidding when I say this. If I had done this, I might not have the problems I am experiencing now. And get your annual checkup every year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all, much love.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AsianMasculinity","subreddit_id":"t5_30c2m","subreddit_subscribers":39139,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Been lurking here for years.

I notice now who put's in the effort when thinking of others. I help out taking care of my dads parents, my grandparents. I love my grandparents, they miss there son so bad, he was the only one that stayed in there life, his brothers made bad decisions and my grandparents hardly talk to them so my dad was all that was left for them. Well they have grandchildren, me and my sisters.

We used to say we where back of the church pues type of people. Out of the way but listening and participating, interested in what everyone had to say but never saying anything else.

He did.  \n\nThe day of his passing, me and my sister drove him to the ER, he was week and couldn't carry any weight. He told us for those few months before it was nothing.

It's very costly. I'm fully aware I can get scholarships or whatever considering my disability- but I want to study Psychiatry. I want to be a doctor in some way.

Therefore, I'm not going to college until I saved well-enough money to spend. College, to me, is only important if you wanna get into those high-end, important jobs like being a doctor. I don't support the notion that a high-schooler should automatically go to college after they graduate.

I feel such a sense of loss even though I am 21 years old and in no way ready for children. \n\nThe Sunday before Thanksgiving I decided to stop by the Walk-In clinic in my town because I had been having a headache for about a week or so. I have chronic migraines and this had happened before so I didn't think anything of it. They tested my urine and it came back positive for pregnancy, and it was only then when the Physician Assistant pressed on my abdomen did I realize how tender it was. They sent me to the Emergency Room for an ultrasound and blood work, and 7 hours and 1 dose of MTX later I was sent home with a Pregnancy of Unknown Location. My HCG levels increased over the next week though, so I ended up there again for another dose of MTX and a blood bank order just in case I ruptured. I was so scared, and even though I am hoping I am got my final blood test today, I still can't stop thinking about what could have been. I know that even if it was a viable pregnancy I would have had an abortion, but in some ways I will miss being \"pregnant\" (I know thats not really whats going on, but I still have a bunch of pregnancy symptoms so I feel like it is). I always wanted kids in the future, but clearly because I have an IUD I wasn't looking to get pregnant right now. If others have experienced this, how long did it take you to stop thinking about your ectopic constantly. I think about it every hour of the day. I rub my stomach sometimes imagining the fetus dissolving. I am so sad for it, even though I am pro-choice and all that. In some ways I wish that my HCG levels were still higher so I could validate the emotions I am feeling.

I asked out few girls since 10th grade, but nothing happened. Well, to be fair in highschool I didn't have a car so I couldn't date. And in college, I still lived at my parent's house to save money. \n\nEventually, I became resentful. And I used that resentment to focus on my career.\n\nBy Junior year, I landed an internship at a decent tech company in Seattle. There was a girl in the same team who liked me but I really wanted to get back to that company after graduation and didn't want to take any chances by dating her.\n\nWhen I came back from the internship, a girl who I asked for prom and rejected me in high school told me she had a crush on me but was too afraid to be in a relationship with me. I mean, what was I supposed to do? Be in a relationship with her when I know for sure that I'll be moving to a different city as soon as I graduate? So I turned her down this time.\n\nThere was another girl I really liked and wanted to ask her out but rich Chinese guys were hitting on her, which discouraged me. Also, I knew I'll be separated from her after graduation even if I end up dating her, so I never asked her out.\n\nSo I graduated in 2020 and it was a bad year to graduate. Career was everything in my life me and not being able to find a job after graduation was extremely painful and had no time to think about this issue.

I have a job that pays well, yet alone and lonely. Maybe I am being ungrateful for what I have, maybe it was a trade-off. But maybe my life holds no meaning other than who I am as an employee. \n\nHonestly, at this point, idk how to be in a relationship since I moved to a new city.

I am 22 years old age.Since the whole shutdown I have a fair amount of time on my hands nowadays and have been looking to start up some new rps! I have a few in mind already I normally stick to adventure fantasy and romance plot lines. I have always been a sucker for magical quests and adventures, getting to explore worlds outside of ones reach. Now for rules I do some smut but really I don\u2019t enjoy it to be the main focus on the rp. And please don\u2019t try to force relationships right away I much enjoy more of a slow burn kinda thing. It makes up much more of a spark between the two of the pairing works of course. And ghosting? No I have had a troublesome time with that quite frankly it\u2019s annoying, I understand if life gets to hectic but please but send me a little message. If you intend to end it that\u2019s fine but a heads up Is far better lol. Anyways besides that I\u2019m pretty open to anything, if you wanna try one of your own plots that\u2019s perfectly fine with me but I do have some with my own ocs I\u2019ll set them here if you wanna test the waters\n\nAs the starlight lit up your pathway in the darkened thicket of the woods. You could hear a low whimper from between the trees. Cautiously you\u2019d take a few steps forward heading towards the sound. Unknown to the hidden danger you would face once encountering this strange creature. With your left hand you\u2019d slowly peel apart a branch severing to part you and the beast. Your eyes flung wide, as you glanced down at the creature. With horned spikes, large fangs and those dagger like claws. One could see why these creatures were so fear among your village. It was laying in a pool of blood..clearly in no shape to put up a fight due to its wounds.\n\nA mimiced laugher would be heard from the cavernous walls above. Suddenly a being came crashing down at full speeds. Using its powerful wings to guide along the air currents. It shoot downwards shoving you against the stone cold floor. Holding you under its own body weight a sinister voice came from its throat.\u201d You are you..human.\u201d It would question having its weapons drawn in case you try to attack.\n\nShe danced along the dirt pathway paying no mind to her fellow kin glancing to her direction being the chiefs daughter would do that. Her wings flapped slightly as she spun around enjoying the fresh air and sun. Peering down she jumped from the platform. Carrying a bundle of berries along with her. She continued along her way humming a little tune, until she got to the river of course it was rushing quite strong due to the rainfall from last night. Stupidly she stumbled and slipped in rushing with the river struggling and screaming for anyone to help her..\n\nAnother day it seemed she made her way down the block smocking while flipping through her phone. Concentrated on that other then anything out of her field of view. She brushed a bit of hair behind her ear. Not seeming to concerned about the up coming meeting. She heard a few coughing sounds a young man was voicing some complain about her. She lifted an eyebrow glancing over at him.\u201d Got a problem?\u201d\n\nAnd there we go I set those up so ya can jump on in of course I have a lot more.

Trying to put the years of anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and alcoholism behind me, and focus on a positive future. Trying to save for a down payment for a house in the next two years. Blah blah blah sob story, I will cut to the chase -\n\nUltimately I'm trying to improve my credit and save for a down payment on a house. I finally checked my credit report today for the first time in my life and I need some advice.\n\nTo improve my credit score can I call these companies and negotiate the cost down\/get them to delete them from my credit report? OR should I work with some local credit repair company who would better know how to do that. (Nervous about getting scammed) OR should I work with a national credit repair company?\n\nThis is what appears on my credit report -\n\nMy credit score is 567 -\n\n**Two open accounts**\n\nStudent loan - $17,144\n\nStudent loan - $11,031\n\nOpen account total = $28,175\n\n**10 closed accounts**\n\nCheck credit or line of credit (6 years)- $12\n\nCar lease (5 years)  - $3,147\n\nDental credit card (5 years) - $354\n\nCredit card (5 years) - $595\n\nCheck credit or line of credit (5 years) - $427\n\nFactoring company (2 years) - $378\n\nCollection department (2 years) - $144\n\nCollection department (1year) - $139\n\nCredit card (11 years) - N\/A\n\nCheck credit or line of credit (11 years) - N\/A\n\nClosed account total = $5,196\n\n**Total = $33,371**\n\nAny advice on where to go from here would help me so much.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Fucked up credit, should I go to a credit repair company (local or nationwide) to help negotiate balances down \/ get them deleted from report?\n\n**Edit:** Just to answer some questions:\n\nI do not have any credit cards, I've been under the impression that I couldn't get one. Like I said I just looked at my credit score for the first time ever.\n\nI'm in sales so every month income varies, but **after taxes\/benefits** I typically bring in anywhere from $3500 to $7000 that actually goes into my checking account.\n\nSpending was wild this last year, on booze, going out, ubers, juul packs, and uber eats EVERYDAY, but now my only expenses are $1800 for rent and $100 for cell phone. (Rent goes till end of april, but I've moved home and trying to end the lease early)\n\nCar lease is over - I stupidly never took it back to the dealership. They repo'd it. They told me I owed them 12 grand. Somehow it looks like it's only 3 grand. \n\nNot trying to buy a home right now, trying to figure out what I will need beyond a 20% down payment to buy one in roughly two years.\n\n**OK HERE'S MY REAL QUESTION:**\n\n**IF I PAY OFF ALL THOSE DEBTS (BESIDES THE STUDENT LOANS AND CAR LEASE) CAN I GET THEM DELETED AND THEREFORE INCREASE MY SCORE?**\n\nAlso if anyone can recommend credit companies and\/or apps that would be so helpful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of great advice - CAN I PAY THESE AND GET THEM DELETED\/TOTALLY REMOVED FROM CREDIT HISTORY SO THAT IF SOMEONE LOOKS UP MY CREDIT REPORT\/HISTORY THEY WOULD NOT APPEAR AT ALL?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","subreddit_subscribers":14627058,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"32 and trying to get it together","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.92,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/ko28ha\/32_and_trying_to_get_it_together\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I am 19 years old, she is 56, and she acts like the moody teenager I never was. \n\n1) She has drinking problems, probably an alcoholic who doesn't realize it, and let it get so bad so I had to go to the emergency room for child psychiatric care when I was 17 and was handed over to my aunt for half a year. It was triggering for me, traumatic, because when I wasn't in her house any longer, she paid me zero attention when I was feeling at my lowest. She has been like this since my early childhood and she gets drunk to the point where NOTHING registers in her mind. We live on the highest floor, no elevator and she came home drunk to the point where she would fall over (aka not safe to go in staircase and go outside when you can't even stand straight). On behalf of my aunt's advice I was told to tuck her into bed and made sure she wouldn't go out and fall down the 4 flights of stairs. She decided to kick me several times when I tried to do that, swore on a family member's grave that she wouldn't leave the aparment just to do it anyway at 1 AM drunk as hell. She made me and my aunt worried sick for several hours and ruined our New Years.Also made me keep her drinking a secret since I was 12 so until I was about 15 I didn't even feel safe enough to tell my aunt about it.\n\n2) Gives zero sh\\*t about the fact that the fact that both of my parents are alcoholics is traumatic for me and makes me feel like I have no stable point in life. I asked her to stop drinking because she can't hold her alcohol and she legit answers me that \"when you tell me to not drink, it makes me want to drink more.\" Argues like a moody teenager. I've always had to take the parental role and made sure someone took responsibility since she can't do it herself. She then also blames me for being like a mom. God.\n\n3) Humiliates me to the point where it gave me a panic attack in school because \"-It's a mother's right to embarass their kid\". I don't even know what is normal parental behaviour anymore.\n\n4) Constantly provokes me when I'm in a bad mood and doesn't give me any privacy (she used to lock the front door to hinder me from going out when I was a teenager and called me 22 times in half an hour if I was out with friends) and then tells me that I'm \"-Filled with hatred\" when I get angry at her.\n\n5) She was never there for me, yet she wants to be accredited for my entire personality and has straight up told me that I have her to thank for my personality (which is kind of sus considering she earlier mentioned that I was full of hatred). \n\n6) Oh this really takes the cake (or lack off), back in the days when I was anorexic she wouldn't even bother trying to help me or encourage me to get better. Instead, she asked me to share my meal with her. I was eating 150 kcal a day, and she asked her anorexic teenager to share some of it with her :) \n\nShe constantly makes me feel angry, and I still feel like a shit person after she told me I was filled with hatred and I just think that is how everyone views me now. Still, she thinks I don't have any reason to be angry or upset with her, not even when she is repeating these behaviours which I listed. Is she right?'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so sorry if I posted this in the wrong section, this is my first time on reddit.

I hope and I guess some of you can relate and understand...\n\nI feel uncomfortable even writting ''Self-harm\"... I'll try to summarize all this...\n\n\\*I'm a francophone... I try to do as less mistakes as I can (dictionary and stuffs)\n\nIt first started when I was 11, I was in elementary school and I can't even explain why I did it.. but I did on my forearms... I told my mom... I didn't tell her but I showed her, I asked her to close her eyes and  put her fingers (it's weird... I know) on my forearms**. I remember her crying and saying to me that only people who don't like themselves do that.** I went in my bedroom and trying to take of all the scabs away... (It's weird.. I know) We never talked about it since. In a way, I think that I wished that she just have scoop me in her arms and... I don't know tell me that everything's going to be okay... (It's probably childish to say that... but I didn't know at that time that I was looking for comfort.\n\nThen, when I was 14-15 ish.. high school... On my thighs, pretty bad... Only the right one. At that time, I feel in love for the first time and it was a girl... I got confused if I was discovering that I may be gay?... Classic story, I always wanted to be the perfect girl.. 90 overall average at school, sports, arts, everything... I was interested into everything about life... I was adopted when I was a baby... maybe for me I have an issue with it, even if I deny it and love my family, because family goes beyond blood... My thigh got terrible, going into a private school wearing uniform.. Skirts. Always wearing tights. I wasn'T happy at all, I felt like there wasn't anything making sense about life around me and a total disconnection with me... Maybe a teenage crisis ish? \n\nI was lucky enough that friends of mine.. I guess \"doing what I was doing'' was so heavy on my heart that I confine to them, it's a bit blurry... for that part, so I'll skip it... I ended up seeing a consellor and my parents never found out. I started to get better and swimming, which is my favourite sport. I was good at it and got recruted to swim in a swimteam, even though my thigh was covered of... yeah. Due to swimming, I stopped.. doing it. I can't say how embarrased I was at first, but my swimteam's friends were... so nice to me and we didn't have to talk about it, they just.. accepted my body how it was. :'') Once, my coach and I talked about it just for a few minutes.. I don't remember what we were saying but I think I was a bit offended..  I was having competitions and told my parents to not come, they never saw me swim...\n\n**They never saw me in a bathing suit or short for 10 years. I'm 23 and I still can't find a way to tell them.. I don't know how, why or just... I don't want them to worry, etc...**\n\nFast forward, 19 year's old: It's a long story... a very long story so if I just get to the point: I got diagnosed bipolar (1 or 2 I don't remember) and borderline. It's a verryyy long story so I won't say anything about it... **I'm not justifying** that I did and I'm doing what ... I'm doing because of those diagnosis. I moved from my parents right before my 19 birthday, I was drinking a lot of alcool, smoking a looootttt of weed and cigarettes... and I started to.. cut myself again... It was pretty bad. The worst that I've done... Still on the right thigh. Always and only the right thigh... I gave only one part of my body to ..well ... this.\n\nTherapy and other stuffs... help me to stop doing it. I didn't do anything for 3 years ish (or almost nothing) until last night... and I feel bad about it.\n\nI'm an extravert person, open minded and love life so much... but sometimes I seems to forget who I am... and I lose it. I do it for a lot of reasons and it keeps me going for the day or the night as if everything is fine. It's another long story... so yeah...\n\nIf you read until the end, thank you :) and if... you have any questions about things I said or not said... message me?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"selfharm","subreddit_id":"t5_2rm6q","subreddit_subscribers":73017,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Hello, this is my story with...

Until now.\n\nI spent the last 6 years consuming as much atheist material as I could get my hands on. Books, YouTube, this subreddit... I wanted to be ready for when the inevitable conversation came up with him.\n\nWhat surprised me is not that he approached me, that was inevitable, but that this intellectual guy with a Masters and a Doctorate would start the dialog with a video with almost no substance. The video does nothing but try to use subtle emotional queues to convey it's point and it's point is really to do with the purpose of deconversion stories.\n\nI haven't yet responded to him and I don't really know how I want to do that. Other than a few nuanced clich\u00e9 misconceptions of atheists and our position, there is simply nothing that I can refute on the video that is relevant.\n\nAnyway, this is the video:\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QeYqsfuW2zc","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"exchristian","subreddit_id":"t5_2r95q","subreddit_subscribers":87765,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Dad (finally) approached me regarding my deconversion.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.96,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/exchristian\/comments\/ko2dc4\/dad_finally_approached_me_regarding_my\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

First, thanks for being such a great community. \n\nSo I am 24 years old and this would be my first deal. I've been looking into real estate for awhile and just couldn't find a deal that made sense, but I finally found a self storage property that I think would make a lot of sense. As I mentioned in the title, the catch is that is has 0% occupancy. \n\nSo obviously I was extremely curious why none of the spaces have been rented out and was asking a million questions to my agent about that. Basically the owner had a business (he did a lot of things in the business such as carpet cleaning, wood panelling, contracting etc) and ended up building the storage property in order to hold supplies and client's belongings while he was cleaning or working on their house. Now he has 55 units and he did not use all those units for his business, but apparently he was just too lazy and not interested in renting them out. Now it sounds a little weird that's the case but I visited the property and they seem like they are in great condition (built in 2001) and there is definitely supply in the area, I looked at other storage units in the area and all are at 90+% occupancy (and the city is growing in size). Also the owner is old + ill and is selling both his businesses (his cleaning business + the storage units). \n\nNow obviously the biggest question is can I fill the spaces, but I'll walk you all through some of the numbers. The price of the property is **$650k**. I cannot get a commercial loan from the bank since the property doesn't have any revenue yet, so I would have to get the property owner financed for the first year (then refinance). \n\nThe owner is willing to finance at 25% down, 7% interest (crazy right!) -- That would mean that I have to put **$162.5k** down on the property. \n\nMy agent is confident that we can get the first 6 months payments deferred (since that would give us time to fill some of the units, and then possibly a staggering interest rate. \n\nIn addition, I still need to do my own research on my end to confirm this but my agent believes that **$50k** is needed in upgrading the property and installing the security\/automation system -- this would include cameras, code lock on all the units, an electronic Kiosk at the front for self service -- basically all the still that is needed to automate the self storage property. \n\nNow in terms of revenue, using **EXTREMELY** conservative numbers, the property would generate **$6k** in revenue with all the units occupied. This is undercutting price with all the nearby storage facilities, just cause I wanted to be very conservative with my numbers. \n\n*Lets have a recap:*  \nTotal Down: **$212.5k** (money down + upgrades + security system)  \nYearly Revenue:  **$61.2k** (assuming 85% occupied and conservative rental prices)  \nYearly mortgage: **$30.8k** (after a refinance and assuming 5% interest rate)  \nMaintenance + property tax: **$6.1k**  \nYearly Profits: **$24.3k**\n\nThats a 11% CoC return without factoring in the fact that the refinance will most likely come in higher since the units will be rented out by then. \n\n# Now I understand the numbers of the first year are a little funky because it will take time to get the units occupied, but my hope at WORST case scenario is that I will get 50% of the units occupied in 6 months -- is that reasonable? \n\nI have done research in the population and it seems like the area will continue to grow, and as I mentioned the other storage units don't seem to have occupancy issues. \n\nI know that was a lot but does anyone have any thoughts on this situation?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"realestateinvesting","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnt1","subreddit_subscribers":771904,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Considering buying a storage unit with 0% occupancy - am I crazy?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/realestateinvesting\/comments\/ko2e75\/considering_buying_a_storage_unit_with_0\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

At least in my case. As a teenager i didn't read much, and often found reading assigned books to be a huge drag. For example, i absolutely hated Huck Finn and thought it was one of the most boring books I've ever had to read. This applied to the majority of the given material. The only book I actually enjoyed was Lord of the Flies, and even that I skipped chapters for and read as little as possible. What I find funny about this is that at the time I always had the inclination to read more, but never really did. I spent most of my time in the library looking for books, but could never settle for one, though I found to enjoy the few books I read more when I tackled them on my own terms. FF to now and I'm 21 and read everyday. Out of the whim I decided to give Huck Finn another chance and now I find myself quite literally laughing out loud at the story, its characters and its irony, and can't wait for the next moment to escape back to into it. I know this was more about myself than high school books, but I imagine I'm not alone in this, so if anyone reading this has contemplated getting into reading or despised a majority of the books assigned to them for study, I urge you to tackle them on your own terms and give them another shot. I find it depressing that I could have missed out on such a rich story because school sucked out all of the magical art out of it, and even more depressing that these incredible pieces of literature will be lost on those that simply didn't care or weren't ready for it yet. I apologize that this is mostly ramblings, but I felt I had to say it. There's so much to learn from the books given to us, but we almost always approach them with odd sentiments of regretful distaste because \"school is lame\" and other such things.

So for my whole life I've felt like I was in the wrong body I remember wishing praying and dreaming I could be female (I'm pretty sure I'm trans) I remember dressing up in my mom's clothes when my parents were home until 1rst or 2nd grade and got a spanking and screamed at that I was boy and boys aren't allowed to do those things, that's when I started doing those things in private and really where I started to associate shame and fear with this feeling that my body didn't match my soul.. You know how everyone says they remember their baptism i don't really remember mine, I remember getting the priesthood tho and really how awful I felt getting it the feeling that I was forced, I really wanted to be in young women's admittedly but I knew that wouldn't be allowed and that's how it felt every time I got a different form of the priesthood just awful. Which really was the reason I ended up leaving the church after highschool because I just felt awful\/ uncomfortable sitting in the priesthood classes. I went to a college about 200 miles away from my parents where I realized a lot more about myself like that I'm asexual (basically I'm not attracted to anyone in a sexual sense) I actually told my parents about that because I felt it would be a good way to test the waters to tell them everything my mom reacted pretty well to it and said she'd love and support me however she could, my dad on the other hand sent me a 3 page essay on how I'm not and that I don't know anything really just dug in with insults and just comments that really hurt, that made me vow to never tell them everything mostly because I'm scared that they'd disown me or just hate me or something, well it's been about 4 ish years since I told them that and since then I moved back in with them for financial reasons, and it's had its ups and downs as living with anyone does, and I was doing kinda fine with keeping my identity secret but ever since this covid stuff really started it's made me feel like my anxieties, insecurities, and dysphoria are the weight of the earth and I'm atlas forced to hold it up for eternity idk if that makes sense basically it's just been extremely intense this year. I don't know how much longer I can handle it anymore I feel like I'm being crushed staying in the closet, which is why I'm asking this sub your opinion on I guess how you would react if your kid came out as trans to you or idk honestly I guess I'm just curious about your opinion on it idk all I know is I gotta talk to them about it or something because if I don't I'm worried I'll eventually do something I would ultimately regret... honestly idk why I spilled my guts here but talking about it made me feel a bit better thanks for reading I hope you have a wonderful new year.\nSummary: I've felt like I've been in the wrong body my whole life and wished, prayed, or dreamed to be a girl (I'm pretty sure I'm trans) how would you react if your kid (I'm 23 now) came out as trans\/ or I guess your opinion or insight? I'm not looking to be preached at just curious because my parents are lds and I'm scared to talk to them about it I guess I'm trying to get a sense of how they may react.

After seeing a few commercials, I signed up for Noom in February but wasn't expecting much out of myself. Turns out, I was right and I didn't do very well with it. I stuck with it for a couple of weeks but got discouraged when I didn't see any results at all (yeah, yeah, I know!) After that, I stopped reading the daily articles and following the daily guidelines. My MIL came to stay with us in March and was a huge help here with my twins who were remote learning. Unfortunately, she is a great cook and I still wasn't paying any attention.\n\nIn April, I reluctantly stepped on the scale when I started noticing my work-from-home pants (pajamas) weren't as loose as they used to be. 240. Two hundred and forty pounds. That is the heaviest I have ever been in my life and I just started bawling my eyes out. Once I composed myself, I contacted a weight loss doctor\/nutritionist and was able to get a virtual appointment the next week.\n\nMy husband joined in with me as accountability partners. From April to August we did really well. My husband is 6ft and went from 215 down to 198. I am 5'6\" and went from 240 down to 212. Then we fell off the wagon. I'm not sure how much my husband weighs today but I'm back up to 220 as of this morning. \n\nThis is not my first rodeo for weight loss. At 35 years old, I'd say this is probably my 12th or so time for attempting to lose some amount of weight. My biggest hurdle that I can see right now is the fact that I've never been able to lose more than 30lbs at a time. 30 seems to be the most my body is willing to give up at any given time and unfortunately every time I do go to lose weight, it's always because I've gained all the weight back and then some. \n\nIn years past, I would be super upset about gaining some of the weight back, but one of my resolutions for 2021 is to try and put a positive spin on things  -- I'm generally a realist\/pessimist so this is gonna take some work! -- and no better time to start than now. Fortunately, this time, I've only gained 8lbs back so I'm already starting out in a better place than I was last time. \n\nSo, here we go: Day 1 starts tomorrow. I've signed the hubby and I up for a local fitness challenge \"66 miles in 66 days\" so I'll be walking an average of a mile a day for the next couple of months which is going to be helpful and hopefully will be enough to form a habit. My gym is opening back up on Monday 1\/4 after shutting down due to the governor's orders. I've also started (yesterday and today so far) doing the 16:8 fasting. I think this is going to be good for me since I know that most of my snacking is done in the evening when I'm watching television mindlessly. Now that I've got an \"official\" cut-off and some rules to apply to myself I think it'll be a good thing to try. \n\nThough Noom ultimately didn't work for me, it made me be more introspective (Is that a word? Am I even using it correctly? Well, you know what I mean. lol!) I am an extremely picky eater (texture is a huge issue for me) so I need to make sure that I am more active if I'm not able to completely overhaul my diet. I am easily able to talk myself out of going to the gym regularly, so I need to actively pay attention to when I'm doing that and force myself to go (I always have a good time and am glad I went but sometimes just getting out the door is difficult!). \n\nRealistically I don't think I'll get down to my goal weight of 125 by the end of 2021, but hopefully I'll be closer than I am today. I'm excited already to be able to look back at this post and see how far I've come. \n\nThank you all for reading this and I look forward to getting to know you all better through our journeys together.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"loseit","subreddit_id":"t5_2rz8w","subreddit_subscribers":2835154,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Obligatory New Year, New Me - First Post","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/ko36r7\/obligatory_new_year_new_me_first_post\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I have a few questions about how to do it.\n\nBasic info about us.\n\n*  I am 48 and my SO is 39.  Annual income between the two of us is $134,000.  We live in a suburb of a PNW city where property values have been going gangbusters. \n* Both have steady jobs.  14 years each at our jobs.  I get regular healthy raises (above cost of living increases) and SO occasionally gets them.  SO's benefits which pays for 90% of our health insurance costs makes up for the more modest pay raises.\n* We have very little debt. We've worked very hard to pay off all of our commercial debt. \n   * Primary residence mortgage - $230,000 balance with $220,000 equity.\n   * Rental house mortgage - $177,000 balance with $146,000 equity.\n      * long term renter.  Rent covers mortgage and taxes.\n   * HELOC for $38,000. \n      * Money was used to do renovations on both the primary residence and rental house.\n      * Still in the interest only portion and we pay toward the principal each month.  \n* Retirement savings is approximately $220,000 between 401ks and company stock.\n   * SO also will get a small pension.\n* We have 3 months liquid for an emergency savings fund.\n* College for kids are covered.\n   * Have enough liquid to finish paying for my adult son from a previous marriage BA.  He has 2 semesters left.\n   * Both kids will be receiving large inheritances in the coming months.  The funds our daughter receives will obviously cover her college costs.\n* We both have 401ks but are not contributing the maximum amount allowed.  We are both contributing the amount to get the full employer match.  4% for myself and 5% for my SO.\n* Outside of 401k contributions, we are saving 15% of our gross income to increase our emergency fund.\n\nSo, with all that in mind, our immediate plan is to open up IRAs for both my SO and I.  Should we do traditional or Roth IRAs?\n\nBeyond that, I am at a bit of a loss about what to do with the rest.  We want to invest it but I start getting overwhelmed when thinking about how to best manage everything.  I know we can each up our 401k contributions to $19,500 each but reducing our monthly income to accommodate that feels scary.  We have a very comfortable budget based on our typical spending.  Of course we could use the windfall to supplement the loss of monthly income but then we would need to keep it liquid and lose out on the gains we could get by investing it.  Plus I worry that having liquid make it more susceptible to us nickel and diming it away, because we do tend to be spenders.  If it is invested, I know we won't touch it unless something catastrophic happens.\n\nWhat is the middle ground approach?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","subreddit_subscribers":14627059,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"How to manage a windfall?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.58,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/ko36ux\/how_to_manage_a_windfall\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

His mom had him when she was a teenager so she's only 4 or 5yrs older than me and that bothers me.\n\nIve always dates significantly older men until recently, I seen to be attracting a lot of guys late 30s.  But haven't really dated many. I worry I'ln15 yrs when I'm 65 he'll want a 30yo right now I'm not menopause I have a higher sex drive than him, but what if I lose my sex drive? My mom what having sex at 70 so I hope not but idk I just worry about so many things. I take very good care of myself but time changes things. \n\nI recently broke it off with him and now I'm starting to wonder if I made a mistake. It seems like I always let the good ones go and end up trying to make it work with the assholes that just waste my time. \n\nAm I overthinking this?  I've learned for the most part men say what they mean.but even if he means what he says now it could change later. Idk. I'm starting to miss him. It's been 3wk and he texted and Christmas just saying I miss you hope you have a great holiday.  He's texted I love you. I don't want to fight but I'll.leave you alone if it's what you want. He looked so sad last I saw him when he came to pick.up something he left. \n\nI don't know what to think. Part of me wants to call him but then part of me doesn't want to start it back up again bc I'm not sure if it'll work long term.\n\nI need to hear from other men about what they think. Is he for real?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskMenAdvice","subreddit_id":"t5_33yx5","subreddit_subscribers":46792,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Is he serious?

I had no clue what it meant but whatever. My mom had discussed with the doctor what we were to do about it, and they said Adderall. I was prescribed 30mg adderall, and we alternated between the pills, and these little square patches you put on your hip. \n\nBeing on it, I did absolutely nothing. I ate no food, I never slept, and I didn't speak unless it was very few words. I had this big puffy jacket that covered my mouth, so I just used that to hide myself while The stimulant went to work on my brain. \n\nI was always working, never stopping. I did all my school work, all my homework, straight A's. I carried a math text book everywhere, an 8th grade one when I was in 1st grade. If i got bored, I would whip that puppy out and start doin math problems in the middle of Walmart. What I'm saying is, I was extremely smart. It's pretty funny considering now I have dyscalculia and I can't even add 18 to 24 without using my fingers.\n\nThe medication always kept me under wraps. I felt nothing, I did nothing but work, and when work was over, I made more work. I never made jokes, I never acted out, I never played, I never experienced much aside from what my abusive brother put me through, and the bullies at school. I didn't act like a child, I didn't get to be a child.\n\nIn 4th grade, I told my mom I didn't want to take it anymore. So, I didn't. Big mistake, or good choice? I immediately started acting like a four year old. Weird faces, stumbling speech, never in my life going a dsy without taking a race car to school and playing with it in my desk. Everyone around me acted as if they were already 15, and I was stuck acting like a preschooler. My grades dropped, I failed multiple classes but I was so... hyperactive that my teachers didn't want to deal with me, and they sent me on up to the next grade. \n\nI still acted like a child, I did mature, but not at the right pace. I was always behind. I would be 15 and still act like I'm 10. I always brushed it off as \"my brains wired different, I'm not like them\" which is true, but I completely disregarded what 30mg adderall and increasing to 45mg adderall could do to a young child. \n\nI'm not even grown now. I'm definitely matured, but not in the way an adult should be. I feel 15, and I have the maturity of someone much much younger.\n\nWhat's worse, when I stopped taking adderall, I never took anything else, ever again. Did you know ADHD unmedicated and unchecked can evolve? Like why does it have to get worse? I have developed schizophrenia, and I'm showing signs of bipolar disorder. \n\nI swear it's like ADHD is just this big basket of fuckery and it gets to a point where you just feel enveloped by ADHD. I feel like a person generated entirely by it. \n\nAlso, screw the people that always told me \"it goes away when you get older.\" It doesn't. For people that have the decreased symptoms, it's just because they're busy and they've learned to cope. ADHD doesn't go away. For many, many people it just gets worse and worse.\n\nI recently got back on meds, for my schizophrenia and wellbutrin to help a little bit with my ADHD, but if that doesn't help I'll just go to the actual doctor instead of my therapist. Just trying to feel out my options incase I get the left right goodnight from adderall again.\n\nIts so hard living with it. It's like, no one even understands the entirety of your disorder. And when you explain, it's just you rambling for an hour about whats wrong with you, and then they just take it at face value rather than using your badly described disorder to feel out how hard it actually is, and how patient they need to be with you. \n\nI don't know, I'm just rambling. Life is hard. I just want my brain to fuck off sometimes. I'm so tired of it. I just hope I can find a way to get myself together. With the schizophrenia and the psychosis, my severe generalized anxiety disorder, and ADHD my life is like a constant panic attack. It feels awful. I'm not even deemed allowed to live on my own because someone thinks I'm going to hurt myself. \n\nSorry if I turned this into a pity party. I'm new to this community because every time I see something about ADHD I usually get overwhelmed and have to stop looking at it immediately, so I thought I'd maybe try it out and try my best not to overload. \n\nIf I feel like this is too dumb to write about I'll probably delete soon. I just have no one to talk to about it.\n\n\nEDIT: thank you to everyone that commented, i can see now that feeling so much younger than you are is just ADHD, i don't know why i didn't realize that. it seems every problem i have with myself is a result of ADHD. \n\nthank you for telking me your experiences and everything. it really helps a lot. i get confused really often and having so many people saying the same things helps me set my brain back on the path it should be, rather than it branching out to 300 different possibilities. \n\nthank you again. i hope you had good christmases and a good new year.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ADHD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnwb","subreddit_subscribers":1207177,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Being diagnosed with ADHD and being made to take adderall when I was 4 years old has stunted my mental maturity, I think","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.93,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ADHD\/comments\/ko3hpd\/being_diagnosed_with_adhd_and_being_made_to_take\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I feel confident that 99% of panic attacks I may get now I can solve by myself but there has been rare occasions where I actually can't and have nobody or anything to help \n\nWeed though was magical for me, harmless in many ways (I know its not actually harmless but hopefully you get that it won't at least KILL ME IF I FUCK UP) it helped my anxiety,  I get happy motivated and at peace. Even can sleep at night. But right now I can't afford it and no longer have a dealer anyway, I live in New York where its illegal. I've been robbed trying to find weed and arrested for having low amounts. So I'm afraid to tell doctors it helps me\n\nSo now I just got my doctor to give me a benzo prescription,  he wants me to take 10mg of escitalopr\u00e1m oxalate everyday once a day. I told him I need it for panic attacks I was hoping to get Xanax bars as that I had abused a few times in high school. Only would take one bar when I was panicking really badly and it worked blissfully. But id see others taking that dose and being blacked out zombies\n\nI have taken this new drug for two days now and realized that this is a trap to become reliant on this drug. Idk why I didn't realize sooner but when I tried the first dose I was calm for a few hours, I thought maybe it could work. All these doctors keep telling me to take it EVERYDAY as it may start really helping weeks or months from now\n\nNo im not stupid, I will not ruin everything I've taught myself these 22 years about dealing with my demons\n\nIf I became reliant it may end up eventually either not working anymore or making my anxiety worse everyday once I quit.
