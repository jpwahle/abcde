I'm no stranger to the weight loss game, I've played it many times. I've battled eating disorders for nine years so when I start getting back into being healthy I tend to get obsessive. I've done the vegan thing, the vegetarian thing, the high protein low fat thing, calorie counting and keto and calorie counting by far worked the best. I'm five four and started back in march at 155. I've always looked like I weigh less than I do, which I guess is a good thing. I began using mfp then and working out six days a week. I probably went a little overboard because when friends came back in town over the summer I started doing the whole drinking and ordering drunk pizza and whatnot. I got down to 145 and maintained that all summer since my high calorie intake was balancing out with my high intensity calorie burning workouts. They left in the fall and I got back on track and calorie counted, cut out the alcohol and hot down to 138. Then I got obsessive and ditched the whole thing and started binging...horrible cycle. But starting November first I want to be binge free, non obsessive and healthy! Here is my plan. I'm 5'4, 143 and want to get down to 120 or 125. Most people think I look around 130 now due to how my body is proportioned so well see how this goes! I'm planning on doing 1400 calories a day and running 4 miles 3 times per week and lifting weights 3 times per week as well and maybe a walk on those days or some light cardio. I want to allow myself two cheat meals per week of 500 calories each, preferably on days im running. I plan on drinking at least 80 ounces of water. Breakfasts will consist of black coffee, and either: flax quinoa oatmeal with cinnamon, stevia and half an apple, or two eggs scrambled with feta and spinach, or Greek yogurt with berries and almonds, or turkey sausage and half an avacado. Lunches will consist of some sort of huge spinach salad with chicken and veggies or some sort of chicken taco salad or a small salad and soup that fits in my calorie budget. Dinner will be some sort of protein, chicken or fish with a bag of microwaves veggies.  Some days a protein shake before I workout, maybe some nuts as snacks. Any suggestions or tips, or guesses on how long this will take?

I am 21 and in college. my life has been slowly going downhill for the longest time and I need help in changing something. \nTo start, I have been feeling depressed for a little while now and unfortunately lonely. I have very few friends, but no one to talk to about stuff like this. I wish i had just one person to vent to, or share feelings, or talk to about stuff like this. I feel as though my life is only going to get worse from here on out because I see no happiness in my future. I am losing motivation to work because what is the point of getting a job in the future if its just money to support yourself. I want someone to spend money on and time with me. It seems I am always peoples second choice to hang out with or invite places. Even people I have known my whole life. Most weekends I just stay home doing nothing or trying to get homework done because no one wants me. I try to make friends but I am just terrible at it. I am a commuter so that makes it even harder. I worked up the courage to talk to a girl and she's cool, but I don't know how to keep going with a conversation on people I know nothing about. This was a big step for me though because I find it hard to start the conversation with someone I don't know. To make it worse, for some reason my friends never introduce me to their friends and thats when I actually have common ground to talk about things, but I just rarely get to meet them. Its like I'm trapped in a small social bubble. I think most of my sadness comes from never having a girlfriend or even a girl interested in me. I feel so unwanted and unloved. To make it worse, the few friends I have have girlfriends and ditch me constantly to hang out with them causing me to feel even more lonely. I am a relatively confident guy its just I am not incredibly talkative like a lot of guys. I can't just make conversation out of nothing. I just see no type of relationship ever in the future, and why would a girl want an unexperienced guy who never even kissed a girl before? I used to love myself and be comfortable with myself, and still am to some degree, but am starting to doubt myself and questioning my life. It makes me think how a girl can ever like me if I'm 21 years I haven't got a single girl to want to date me. I have a list of dates/adventures to do that I REALLY want to try, but its all stuff that you would need a girlfriend or someone really close to do with. Not things I can invite a guy friend to. I feel like I'm wasting my life not having fun with these things, but I can't do them alone, most of them would be strange if I did. I just want the feeling of once in my life of someone wanting to be with me and hang out with me. It makes me feel so unwanted and lonely that this has never happened. I find myself going out of my way to try to make other people happy lately because I feel like it will at least add some type of meaning to my lonely existence, if I'm not happy at least someone else can be. I just feel its not healthy to put everyone else happiness in front of your own when you feel like this. I think most of my sadness comes from this feeling of being unwanted and lonely.\n\nThanks for reading. Any advice or help would be great, I need to break this cycle. This loneliness seems too much to bear and I can't take it anymore. Also, I know joining clubs at college would be good, but I don't find myself interested in much lately and I have trouble walking to places alone and actually talking to people I don't know especially when most people are in a friend group by their senior year. Its intimidating to walk into a friend group and converse with a bunch of people you don't know.","media":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1441094087,"created_utc":"1414800548","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"depression","domain":"self.depression","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"default","distinguished":null,"title":"Lonely, caught in a cycle.","secure_media_embed":{}}

Nor I am usually motivated into writing my personal problems in here. But I think I am forcing myself into doing this to really help me since I do not seem to be doing it by myself.\n\nI have always been a kind of socially awkward guy, overthinking all the situations and generally anxious about anything i was insecure about, even though I have a mindset of not worrying about others opinions. Had a few girls, less than I wish I had and this factor seems to be really a pain in the ass for me. It is like if I expect myself to get better if, and only if, i have someone that cares about me romantically.\n\nEven though, I seem to be lacking a sort of motivation to do things. I guess motivation is not the right word. It is just that I am extremely lazy into doing things. It could be afraid of trying, but I think it is more related to 'having a spotlight' into myself. Some sort of fear of receiving attention from people. \n\nA little background. I am 22, male and engineering student. I have a few interests such as piano, reading and swimming. I wish to work at Disney as an Imagineer. Ok, it is nice that I know what I want for my life, but I don't seem to start focusing into doing it.\n\nI think that all of this 'lazyness' only increases my self-judging and puts me in a more difficult situation. It makes me think I am an uninteresting and uninterested person. And I hold this view that a person attractiveness is highly dependent on the level of how much interesting someone is.\n\nSo, in overall, TL;DR, I am not too sure of how I can fix this. I feel too tired to do anything and I think I live a mediocre life.\n\nIs there any wise soul willing to help this lost one?\n\nThanks a lot for reading up to this point.\n\nEdit: Some grammar correction.","media":null,"ups":6,"retrieved_on":1441094032,"created_utc":"1414803347","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"confidence","domain":"self.confidence","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"[Help] I am feeling a little lost.","secure_media_embed":{}}

I used a Low Calorie Diet, with Low/No carb days (Not Keto) to diet down and after cutting, well, I like how I looked.  \n\nBefore, I was about 245-255 and I literally ate WHATEVER I wanted.  I literally tried to eat as much as possible.  Probably consuming 10,000-15,000 calories/day (No Joke).  I play Football and I Olympic Lift 6-7x week and Condition 6-7 times as well.  I worked at a Gym about 4 miles from home, I'd jog there, do two HITT classes/day, then jog home.  \n\nBefore #1- http://i.imgur.com/OQ1AXD7.jpg\n\n\nBefore #2 - http://i.imgur.com/JelPKPG.jpg\n\nAs mentioned, I lost about 40-50 pounds, following a Low-Calorie Diet, that had high (relatively speaking) carb and low/no carb days.  \n\nHere's how I look now(~215lb)\n\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mzW9Vpj.jpg\n\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ptfy8ED.jpg\n\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GkEztMJ.jpg\n\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gFfI6QZ.png\n\nI felt like I 'Starved' myself to that weight instead of working towards it.  Honestly, in those 3-4 months, I probably worked out about 10 times, tops.  No basketball, no football conditioning (No energy).  I was at about 3000-3500 cal/day.  \n\nI'd much rather HAVE the energy to workout (I love training) versus starving myself to a low body fat %\n\nThe problem I'm having is that I'm 'overthinking' my calories.  Most people that I see attempting Keto are either significantly overweight and simply dieting, or doing Ketogains, but do not have similar training goals (i.e. They're simply trying to gain Size or Strength, not necessarily training as a 'Football Player')\n\nThat all being said, I have a few questions:\n\n- How would I go about estimating my TDEE?\n\nMy BMR is about 2200 and the online calculators have my TDEE anywhere from 2900-4000 (Such a wide range).  The problem is that I have no idea what 'Active' is or what 'Intense' is.  Both are such relative terms.  Is a 2 hour Olympic Lifting session 'Intense' even though I'm not sweating profusely?  What if I do '2-a-days' and play basketball at night?  \n\nI hear stories about Michael Phelps eating like 12,000 calories/day, but I don't want to just mindlessly gorge myself either.\n\n- Is Keto/Ketogains right for me?\n\nAre carbs just something that my body needs to excel athletically?  Are my 2-3 hour Gym Sessions too much for a No Carb Diet.\n\n\nYesterday, I had an amazing workout and ran a 5K at night.  Today, I woke up, went to the gym, and left after about 2 sets.  It's not even 8pm at night, and I'm struggling to keep my eyes open and I literally cannot move (Pure Lethargy, not so much soreness)\n\n\nI'd like to see this out, as I think this diet will allow me to keep my bodyfat low and also continue to make Strength Gains.  But, what should I do in the mean time?  \n\nI had 4,000 calories today, and still feel like I have nothing to give.

To be frank, I am a very slender girl, and I definitely can't put up a fight; the only thing I've got going for me is the fact that I'm 5'9\". I work until 1 or 2 in the morning and have a half an hour bus ride home, followed by a 10 minute walk through a quiet neighbourhood to my house. This being, I keep a 4\" switch blade on me at all times.\n\nSo this one night, I had a light shift, and got off of work at about 1AM; I had just managed to catch the last bus. Usually, I'm the only person apart from the driver, but tonight I had company. There were four big guys (probably 6' each) mumbling, had their hoods up, and were wearing sunglasses despite it being a freezing winter night. They were about 20-25, and they sat behind the wall separating the driver from the bus, so they could avoid being seen by the camera. I sat at the back of the bus, close, but not near enough to talk to a small Korean girl in her early 20's. I had seen her get on the bus going towards my work every morning, so I knew her stop was three before mine, coming home. She didn't get off at her stop, but instead followed me off at mine. I thought this was a bit odd, but she didn't really strike me as a threat, so I left my headphones in, and my knife in my bag. \n\nI knew she was walking behind me, but it took her about two minutes of walking for her to start stepping on my heels, and breathing down my neck. I took out my headphones cuss her out, but right before I could say something she pulled up beside me on the sidewalk.\n\n\"I can't believe you didn't say hi on the bus! You get so involved in your music sometimes.\" She was talking really loudly, almost shouting. \"Is it cool if I sleep at your house? My dad hates it if I come home too late.\"\n\nLet me set something straight, I was 16 or so and I had never spoken to this woman in my life. Sure I had seen her on the bus, but apart from the occasional 'sorry' for stepping on each other's shoes during rush hour, we had no other interactions. \n\nShe linked arms with me as she spoke and I was in such shock that I didn't say a word, it wasn't until that silence that I heard it... The shuffling feet and mumbling behind us; close enough that they could easily surprise us, but far enough that we couldn't hear what they were saying. It was then that the imaginary lightbulb in my head turned on. I picked up the pace and kept making fake conversation, walking directly past my house. I told her I needed to call my mom to ask if she could sleep over, and she agreed... So I called 911.\n\n\"This is 911 what is your emergency?\"\n\"Hey mom, can MinYoung (made up name) sleep over tonight?\"\n\"Sorry m'am this is 911, can I help you?\"\n\"Yes, I know. We're at [intersection] right now. We're walking pretty fast. We'll be there very soon.\"\n\"Is there an emergency?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Are you being followed?\"\n\"Oh, nothing just that group of guys. You know them.\"\n\"You are being followed by a group of men?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nThe operator asked me to stay on the line for as long as possible but one of the guys had broken away from the pack and had started walking on the road beside us, saying he knew \"MinYoung\" from school (I later found out that Yoojin a.k.a MinYoung went to school in Korea). He said he and his buddies were going back to one of their places for a few drinks, and invited us along. As he talked his buddies drew closer behind us, so close that I felt one of their hands brush the end of my ponytail. One of his friends started hassling me about being on the phone, and I had run out of fake conversation to make; I was stuttering and eventually silent. One of the guys reached out and grabbed my phone from me, luckily he didn't look at the number before tossing it down the street.\n\nThe girl began to sprint, but the guy who threw my phone still had his hand on my wrist. I looked him dead in the eyes and kicked him in the balls. This was an unwise descision... they got violent.\n\nMy 'friend' was already two blocks away when she flagged down the cop cars and directed them to me struggling with the group of guys. The four were arrested, and Yoojin and I had to testify in court. It turns out that those guys had followed the other girl for about an hour. She worked at a bar, and they made sure to ask another employee when her shift ended. \n\nThe more I look back on it, the more I'm thankful I was there that night. I may have saved a young woman's life, and the funny thing is, we're now good friends. \n\nTL;DR - Followed home by another girl so she could save herself from being attacked. \n","retrieved_on":1441093991,"ups":626,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"LetsNotMeet","created_utc":"1414805489","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.LetsNotMeet","hide_score":false,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"default","title":"My New Best Friend","secure_media_embed":{}}

The world of personal finance is new to me. I hope I don't sound naive. Feel free to explain like I'm 5. Please know that I have only done some preliminary research on this, so I'm far from making a decision about anything. If I sound like I haven't done enough research or planning yet to make a decision, you would be correct. I'm just hoping you guys could start me in the right direction.\n\nOk. I'm looking to get a medical procedure done. It will not be covered by my health insurance. More or less, it's considered an elective surgery and there are specific guidelines to meet in order to qualify that I don't meet. I believe that getting this procedure done will ultimately be the best thing for my health, my well being, and even my financial future to some degree. It will alleviate a chronic illness that will lead to big medical bills and pain in the future. Aside from that, my quality of life would improve significantly, and that's something that all the money in the world can't buy. Please consider all of this.\n\nThe cost of this procedure would be about $7500. I would need to take out some sort of loan to pay for this. People who get this procedure typically do one of the following things: 1. use a medical loan company  like Citerra and MedLoanFinance.com(I've read that interest rates can be ridiculous like 15-25%) 2. put it on credit cards or 3. get personal loans. \n\nThe last time I checked my credit score probably a few months ago, it was in the middle of the average category. Maybe that might help you determine what a potential interest rate for me might be. I'm still settling into a new job in a different part of the country, so I'm still trying to determine what my monthly expenses are, but it looks like the total amount of surplus income I have every month (minus rent, health insurance, food, student loans etc.) is about $500 or so. I definitely realize that this is not a lot, but luckily I have experience living with low means. \n\nAnother thing to note is that I work for the federal government, and I contribute to retirement, FERs (similar to a 401k... and separate from the regular retirement), and Social Security. I feel a little bit better knowing that some money of mine is being saved somewhere. I also have access to starting a Flex Savings Account, which I may be able to use for this procedure (need to double check). There are probably other government benefits that I'm not even aware of, since I just started.\n\nI'll also throw in that I'm a very determined person. If getting this procedure means I have to take public transportation everyday, have no social life (not like I have one now), no Starbucks in the morning, so be it! I could see myself contributing as much money as humanly possible every month. Aren't there credit cards/loans that offer 0% interest for 1 year. I might not be able to pay the whole thing off in one year, but if I really tightened up my budget for that one year, hopefully I could make a solid dent so that the interest wouldn't destroy me.\n\nI do have supportive people in my life, but borrowing money from people is something that I'm not open to doing.\n\nIf you were in my position, what sort of options would you pursue? Where should I start my search for financing my procedure?\n\nThank you, kind people.\n","permalink":"/r/personalfinance/comments/2kxxzh/please_help_a_poor_young_lady_out_with_a/","link_flair_text":null,"title":"Please help a poor young lady out with a financial decision... thanks.

Today started like every normal day, I woke up to a an alarm far too early and catch a few more seconds of shut eye before leaving the warmth of my bed. I drive 30 minutes to school just on time before my first lab, the door is locked so making it by seconds on Fridays is just downright good luck. I am 2/3 years on the way to become a PCP paramedic in Canada.\n\nFast forward to the end of the day, we end the week with a 3 hour practical lab where the class takes turns attempting scenarios made up by our hilarious teacher (he is also an active paramedic). I felt lightheaded after just not into it after not having anything to eat except candy and 1L of chocolate milk since waking up. Why? Its Halloween and I was running around all morning.  I studiously watch and take notes during my classmates scenarios as they play out. In this particular class, medical emergencies, the teacher regularly throws in curve balls to the scenarios. Generally, one paramedic student directs the call while the second paramedic student simply obeys P1. \n\nMy turn up, we usually have different partners every time but this time I had this girl who, once we walked out, was freaking out because she said she didnt feel good or anything. Whatever, cool, chill out let's do this. We get called in, unconscious patient in retirement home(95y/o) where two paramedics are already on scene, close classmates. Weird, ok, CPR this would never happen in real life for one patient- spooky. Scene is safe, all good. Gloves and goggles on, first look, classmate is doing CPR on the stomach. Wtf bro? I instruct him to compress the sternum and he is really confused and panicky. This next split second decision is where is where I fuck up- where my actions interfere with all rational thought. I take over CPR, get my P2 to give synchronized  ventilations. Okay, airway and circulation good now someone tell me what's going on. Classmates exclaim they arrived on scene 10 minutes ago and forget how to handle a cardiac arrest. Okay, whatever, there's only one patient anyway. Upon asking, teacher reveals my patients skin is cyanotic and clammy. Their Bag Valve Mask isn't hooked up to o2, wtf? Hook up 10L P2! Analyzing, dont touch! heart rhythm isn't shockable- shit- just continue compressions. Wtf is this scenario just about doing CPR I aing learning anything. The BVM is missing the bag attachment?   P2 hook up that bag! I send one the classmates to find where they left the bag, get that on- good. The whole time the classmate paramedic who was failing at CPR is just sitting across the patient. He checks a radial pulse with his thumb and says he can't feel anything. I place his two fingers correctly, I instruct him to qualify it and quantify it for me. He is having a lot of trouble and fumbling around with his watch and hands, he can't give it to me. At this point unnoticed hints are being blatently thrown around by my classmates. Gah. I think the hint I finally caught on to was \"HE DOESNT HAVE A RADIAL PULSE HES UNCOUNCIOUS\". OH. oh. ohh. Realizing the severity of my stupidity doesn't hit until after the call is over. Fuck tunnel vision. The call progressed as a standard cardiac arrest and quick transport- this lab follows basic protocols and does not dip into acls. \n\nTransport is accomplished by me simply stating \" transport\". We verbalize what are actions will be until arriving at the hospital. The pads. Fuck. The pads aren't on right, what my hands were on the whole time. Fuck. Teacher says it happens, sure, it happens but these are basics we learn in the first week. The only positive I can draw from this is that 4/5 of the patients from todays scenarious died- at least mine was possibly dead no matter what? \n\nHead back to my classmate lockers, nobody mentions it but I now realize why my classmate gives me a Halloween donut ( googly eyes and teeth). No time to think about the call, breakdance right after class. Learn a cool new move I never thought to attempt before, get it. Sweet. Don't get to drive back the breathtaking girl who also dances in same room, she has to 'babysit'.\n\nDamn. Its dark now, jump in my car. Sink into the seat for about 10 minutes, let muscles relax and warm up. Yes, it's already pretty damn cold up here. Repeated headstands and spins also makes my neck sore, damn. Parking lot is empty so no one is around to think I fell asleep in my car or something who cares. \n\nOn the highway back, rolling at about 100kmph. *I take this routine every day, blah. This evening there is no traffic, sweet. What am I going to do on this Halloween night? My costume is destroyed and I dont really fell like going out. I heard that this is the busiest day of the year for pizza places, damn, I thought of, therefore I want- pizza. Does it really get this dark this early now?* Red lights ! *DAMMMNNN* Front hood completely dented up- \"DAMN!\" Lincoln MKX slammed on its breaks randomly in the fast lane. She gets out, I advance slighlty. Smooth, okay. I get out, instruct her to get back in her care and take the next exit. One exit before the one I take to get off, fuck. Turns out I hit a tank and only her license plate had been scratched. My front bumper, and radiator destroyed, hood creased halfway up at 45 degrees. right headlight shattered. \n\nOne way insurance. Sure. Because I know you want to know- I own a 98 Toyota corolla at 170km. I'm still a student okay?!. Well I know what I'm doing tomorrow morning before I can get to work. maybe I should be a mechanic. \nI guess I could provide pictures if asked.

I just came home from a staff party. Literally, now. It was an open bar so we had all been drinking a bit.  One of the guys who works with me is double my age, aged 33. I'm 17. He was there. During summer while I was working there he became quite friendly, being there for me whenever I needed help, acting like the best older brother. Tonight, he opted to drive me home and I agreed since I don't drive and didn't want to spend money on a taxi since someone offered to drive me home. As soon as we got into his car though he started kissing me. I had no idea how to stop him. That was already bad enough, then he started feeling my boobs... until he got his hands under my top and skirt and started to feel my pussy over my underwear under my skirt. That's when I finally plucked the courage to try and push his hand away before he dove beneath the underwear (thank God for tights) but he wouldn't budge, he kept trying to feel under my underwear. I wasn't letting him and he finally agreed to take me home after a few minutes of pushing my hand away. I can't stop breathing heavily, I feel violated, betrayed, hurt. He took advantage of me. I wish I stopped him sooner. I just didn't know how. I guess I was afraid. The car was parked in a deserted parking lot. Who knew what he could have done to me. On the way home he continued asking whether I was okay. Of course I wasn't! I thought he cared about me as a friend.. I was wrong... very wrong. I'm sorry for this but I needed someone to tell, I can't tell me parents or they'll be too worried to let me out again... and if I tell a friend I don't want them to think I want the attention. Besides this is not something you tell everyone you know. If you have any advice Reddit on how to cope with this feeling of betrayal and hurt, please help.

{"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/personalfinance/comments/2kxzud/im_a_23_year_old_who_cut_ties_with_an_abusive/","ups":1,"retrieved_on":1441093965,"selftext":"**Background:**\n\nIt's a long story and I am skimming over a lot of the details. The basics are that in August 2014, my father, who has been an abusive man all my life and a control freak due to his overzealous religious beliefs, nearly killed me. I am not going into too much detail but his beating left me in bad shape. He only left me alone after I promised I wouldn't call the police and after that, I just had enough and I secretly escaped with whatever I could fit in my best friend's car and some important documents. \n\nI want nothing more to do with him nor do I want to have to ever deal with him again by filing police reports and the like against him. If I ever do face him, it cannot be now because I do not want to undo all the progress I have made (for example, I used to have panic attacks near daily/weekly from the age of 18 when I lived under my father's torture but have not had a single attack in 2 months) I am far away from him and he has no idea where I am or how to contact me.\n\nI contact mother just to let her know I am still alive but do not feel comfortable/do not plan on letting her know my location...my relationship with her is a little complicated as she lives with my father and they seem to have no issues between themselves and he does not mistreat her like he always has done to me (he has always made me the scapegoat for even things I have no logical affiliation with) yet she supports my decision to cut ties with her father. \n\nShe has kept the fact that I contact her secret from my father and in fact helped me get my legal documents when I left (my father hid them from me)...I am on her health insurance until I am 26. It really is a bizarre situation, I have no idea how to explain it. My life constantly flip flopped between my father micromanaging my schedule and actions to him just ignoring my existence since I was about 5 years old. Growing up, my mother was kind to me when we interacted but essentially left me to deal with my father on my own and raise myself and was always working (more than my father). \n\nYeah, there's a lot of stuff I should have done and much better ways I should have dealt with the situation but I really was completely brainwashed and always afraid for my life and lived my life according to what my father dictated.\n\n**Current Living/Spending/Health Situation (August 2014 - Present):**\n\nRent: $0\nFood Cost: $150/month\nSavings: $400 (in case of emergency...I don't really save money) \nMonthly Credit Card Bill Payment: $150 (I spend about $60/month on it mostly bc of gas. $1500 left on 1 credit card with APR of 18.99%, $0 on the other 3 - just finished paying off 1 of them) \n\nLong story short, I now live with a family and live with them for completely rent free. They are wonderful and they have said I can live with them for as long as I want to. They have always considered me and treated me as one of their daughters. I try to help out where I can and pay them $100/month (they refuse to accept anything more than that) to cover some my /living food expenses even though they never have asked for it. So far, our relationship has been great and I know now at the age of 22 what it is like to have people who care about you and to not live every day in fear. \n\nI am getting treatment for depression and GAD and I have a lot of mental issues that I would like to address first before getting a regular job (I am completely unable to hold down a regular 9 to 5 job - I know this from experience).\n\n**Current Employment (September 2014 - Present):**\n\nPrivate Tutor (September 2014 - Present/Planned June 2015): Currently 9 - 10 hours/week at an hourly rate of $40. I earned around $1000 (September 2014 = 25 hours total) and $1200/month (October 2014 = 30 hours total). Working to increase work hours to 15 - 18 hours/week by the end of November 2014. \n\nSince I have a B.S. in Biology, I currently work as a self employed private tutor for high school. I like this job because I am good at it and I can choose my own hours later in the day. The schedule I work on allows me to get enough rest to make up for my insomnia and is flexible enough for me to go to therapy sessions during the week day. This allows me the ability to take the job very seriously and I enjoy it enough to willingly spend a lot of my free time developing extra practice material for my students and seriously researching and developing tutoring methods. \n\nI get paid $40/hour and with 2 student (they are siblings). So far, I have had these students for 2 months and their parents seem satisfied enough to have started making plans for me to also tutor one of the kids for a standardized test on top of what I tutor her for already and starting from mid-November 2014, they have decided to drop their kids' other private tutor and have me handle all of their kids' tutoring. \n\nI now feel like I am mentally sound enough to start increasing the hours I work. I am starting to gain a bit of a reputation among the friend circle of the parents whose kids I am tutoring and so I am now working on increasing the number of students I have. I start tutoring 2 more students from this week at a rate of $45/hour for 2 hours/week each and their parents will determine at the end of November 2014 if they want to continue. \n\nI have also been contacted by 2 more families and will be meeting them this upcoming week to arrange a schedule with their kids. I would say that I am qualified to tutor 8 different subjects (not including standardized test tutoring) so I have been fortunate enough to have had a lot of people contact me and crazily enough, I am finding myself in a position of actually being able to choose my students. \n\nHowever, I do realize that there is no guarantee in this line of work like a contract or something...but then again, I've been fired after working for 3 months as a research tech so I am not sure that getting a normal job would make much difference to me.\n\n**Student Loan:**\n$30,0000 at 7.0% interest.\nSo far (last 2 months), out of what I earn, I have put $700 towards my student loans to be able to pay it off asap. I would like to plan on working as a private tutor for at least another 2 years, maybe even more. I plan on living with this family for one year and they have said that they are okay with this. \n\n**Questions:**\n\nI would like to keep being a private tutor and be self employed as one. I am taking things one day at a time so I feel scared to think too far into the future but now I need to force myself to start facing some things head on. However, I am not sure what financial actions I should be taking. I feel so ridiculously clueless and aimless and want to start taking steps to educating myself but I don't even know where to start. I want to have nothing more to do with my \"father\" and don't want to involve my mother too much in my affairs anymore. \n\nFor example, what do I do for tax return? I've never filed taxes and I am guessing I need to start now? Would I qualify as being self-employed? How would I go about applying to be considered self-employed? I have no idea what to do except paying my student loans and bills on time (if it makes any difference, my credit score as of October 2014 was 737). \n\n I would like to eventually go to grad school...but I have no idea if that is even practical at this stage...\n\nThanks in advance and sorry for the vagueness of my situation. I think I could clarify my situation for myself and others more if I knew what questions I should be asking so please feel free to ask me anything. \n","media":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.personalfinance","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1414806880","subreddit":"personalfinance","media_embed":{},"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"I'm a 23 year old who cut ties with an abusive father, has student loans, and I am trying to qualify as being self employed.

I have a few theories for why I done so, like we were chatting perfectly fine start of october, but then 1 day I message her and don't get a reply, which then takes a week for finally a response, which drove me a bit insane just because I thought I said something or what not, but since then the friendship seems different, barely any interaction over facebook anymore, and chatting to her in school won't work due to UK education system (Me being 17, means I'm in college, where as she's still in highschool). But I'm driving myself crazy over it. \n\nGoing back a step, for when I mentioned I ended up trusting a few friends. Like I had one friend who I trusted who used to go out with her around a year ago, and just shown him a few snippets of a convo we had and he just set me in a great mood about it as he knew what it looked like when she was flirting where as I, well it's like reading harry potter on a spoon for me.This was before the messages just randomly stopped though. \nA week or two after my friends gave me the advice, I came up with the idea on the 14th (Closest wednesday to that date), to tell her at a mutual place we were at, one of my friends Josh, who gave me the advice ended up getting someone out of the room so I could tell her, although I didn't notice this at the time, well I did but I just, don't know couldn't go through with it I guess, but set my mind to telling her on the walk home since we live close-ish to each other, around 5 minutes away.

I was horribly shy and wasn't good at making classmates into friends, so I stuck with the same group of people that I sat with at lunch in middle school until senior year. I had nothing in common with these people, and Freshman or Sophomore year was about the time they started to bully me. Daily. This went on for two or three years. By senior year, they were literally playing keep away with my lunchbox and backpack. Ugh.  \n  \nOne day they cut ties with me by literally running away from me whenever I would try to just sit next to them. I finally got the hint that I shouldn't be there. I sat at a table by myself looking down and just doing schoolwork during lunch for at least a week. Then it happened.

Within the last four years my life has had some extremely high happy times, and absolutely the worst depressions I've ever faced. But you know what?

The owner does not really know about product knowledge and is not up to date on new products so when her daughter (the manager) quit, she was planning on closing up shop.

{"media":null,"selftext":"Second attempt. First one lasted 3 days. First thing I will say is that I looked at porn for about 3 minutes each three times in the past two weeks. I masturbated three days ago without porn, and carefully avoiding the death grip, just thinking about a sexual encounter I had a while ago, and that didn't make me feel as bad as watching porn without MO made me feel. It actually didn't seem to set me back at all. No difference in energy or anything.\n\nI learned about myself today. I thought I knew my reasons for turning to porn but there's more to it. Add loneliness and anxiety to the list. I've been particularly lonely and anxious lately and was in a pretty sadistic mood so I watched a couple of senselessly sadistic movies, one of them had sexual sadism involved and I started sliding from there to other things found myself searching for porn and it happened. Probably only watched about five minutes of porn, but it still happened.\n\nI knew I was going to relapse for a week or so now, it was a matter of when. I knew because I allowed myself to justify it for a week. I knew because I knew I was consciously setting myself up to take the slippery slope back to porn. It's almost a relief that it's overwith now, after a good week or so of resignation. \n\nI know as well as anybody how tough it can be to deal with loneliness. I have zero, 0, no friends whatsoever. I recently moved to a different state. I don't have a job (live with parents) and at the beginning of the semester I made no effort to reach out to anyone. I consciously and politely brushed off peoples' advances earlier, now people leave me alone the way I thought I wanted them to two months ago. So, I'm alone for now. It's hard to the point where it's hard to watch some movies with close friends, \"perfect matches\" or whatever, even if their scenes are limited, because it seems like the sole purpose is to remind me of how alone I am. I appreciate the beauty of the moment, and within an instant I'm sitting there feeling empty because I don't have it. That's one of the emotions I guess I've been numbing for half of my life, but appreciate loneliness for what it is: a drive to seek companionship. If you're where I am/worse situation/better situation whatever, recognize loneliness as a drive to seek companionship. Use it, don't snuff it out with PMO.\n\nOn to the positive effects. My mood and energy, from days 3 or 4 up until the past week drastically improved compared to before NoFap. It felt like feeling true happiness for the first time, even though it sounds cheesey. A sense of elation for no reason whatsoever? Can't remember the last time I felt it. Simple things, like an uplifted mood, that I forgot I could experience. It was great. Experiencing morning wood again for the first time since I was probably in middle school felt awesome. The sense of hope everything brought.\n\nI'm going to give you the best advice you'll hear from anyone on NoFap: Fuck your day counter. Yeah. It's cool seeing your smile turn into a number, your number into a star, the star into a rocket, but that's not the point of NoFap. I've seen many people post that their actual counter is incorrect, or that they're still unhappy, or whatever. When it comes down to it, it represents the last time you reset your badge. The goal shouldn't be to see your Reddit NoFap flair hit 365, the goal should be to cleanse yourself of your PMO addiction and improve your life.\n\nI will tell you with 100% conviction that you're better off masturbating without porn than \"edging\" or \"peeking\" with porn. The real enemy is porn. It's not touching yourself. It's seeing (pixels, but) 10,20,30,50,100 horny, naked women every time you browse a pornographic site. What do you think it does to your self esteem, confidence, view of women, and nerves when you see more naked women via a porn site in a day than you see real, clothed women out in the real world? You're associating women with acting for your pleasure with the click of a mouse, and when it doesn't work like that in the real world, it doesn't seem right; therefore your confidence and self esteem diminish, and you begin to have social anxiety, because all these encounters with women should lead to sex, right? You don't even realize the extent to which you're objectifying women just because you've been doing it for so long to such an extreme extent. Fun fact. I'm 20 years old and since I began my PMO habits I've never been friends with a girl who I didn't have or intend to have sex with. It only recently dawned on me just how bad my view on women is/was.\n\nI'm sure to some degree this applies to everyone with a PMO addiction subconsciously, whether or not you become aware of it. I'm not awkward at all; I can initiate and maintain conversations if I so desire, but I've come to terms with who I was and the path I was on.\n\nSorry for being so long winded, but somebody else is encouraged/will learn from my experiences.","retrieved_on":1441093863,"ups":2,"permalink":"/r/NoFap/comments/2ky7om/just_relapsed_after_25_days_what_i_learned_advice/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Just relapsed after 25 days.

At that point i was quite happy being gay, i was out to most of my friends and even had a boyfriend. I was living with my dad at the time (parents are separated). I always thought he did not mind gay people because i know that he has gay friends. So one brave day i said to him that i was going to bring someone special home with me for tea, and when he saw that it was a guy he flipped out completely. (probably not the best way to come out in retrospect). He told me to pack my things and i had to move out. Also had to move colleges because i had to move back in with grandparents.\n\nI was distraught, i had always been close to my dad. I even broke up with my boyfriend to try and please him, but it didn't work. I haven't spoken to him since, it's been 7 years. When i told my grandparents &amp; mum why he had kicked me out, they weren't very sympathetic either. My family are rich and relatively well known in my area, and they said that i would be ruining their reputation. They suggested if i had to do these things i should move to another city and change my surname.\n\nIt's not something i really want to do, i love my family, and i am very family orientated. I started convincing myself i was straight and that my gayness was a phase and that my sexuality is under my control. I saw a psychologist, and my family are catholic, so i used to go to church a lot. \n\nMy family were so happy when i bought home girls. I was happy that i was making them happy, but the sex and relationships were nothing compared to what i had with my ex-boyfriend. In the last 5 years i have been sleeping exclusively with women, and been convincing everyone i'm straight, i effectively jumped back into the closet. My family all think i'm straight and they have never been prouder of me. My dad still has never contacted me, but i got a Christmas card from him last year. \n\nI am so torn. I know deep down i am lying to myself and others, but i'm so scared of losing my family. I know they care about me, but they have an image to uphold. Right now i'm in a relationship with a girl, have been with her for about half a year. I see her more of a friend than anything, but we both get pleasure out of our relationship.  I know i am being selfish with her, but i hate being alone. \n\nWhat should i do? I feel like i'm at the point of no return. I can't come back out now surely? My family will hate me. I'm 23 and living on my own now, so i have more freedom, but still see my family regularly. \n\nTL;DR.

It started when I was younger (I'm 19 at the moment), like 10-11. I was in my old bedroom, trying to fall asleep in the dark. My door was slightly open, and in the dark I see the silhouette of a person. Yes, a damn person, perfect shape. It immediately feels like my throat just tightens, I try to call for my parents, but I can get nothing but a croak (?) out. I manage to get the light turned on, and there's nothing. When I turn it off, there's nothing still. I slowly start shaking it off, and acting like it was just a dream, except it wasn't?\n\nSome years later when I'm about 16-17, I notice something odd about a picture I had taken a couple of years earlier, where I was standing in my old bedroom where the other thing happened. It was a picture where I was standing at the door, just a normal teenage picture. Nothing odd about it. But then I notice something about the light on the door. It's shaped as a person, again. I send the picture to a friend, and he's like \"wtf?!\" as well.\n\nAbout a year later again, there's weird sounds coming in my bedroom. I'm just laying awake in my bed, trying to fall asleep. Suddenly it feels like something is walking towards me on my bed. Like the sheets are getting pressed down, I could feel the weight of something as well, that feeling. I get scared shitless, I turn on the lights quickly, but there's nothing??? I write to my girlfriend at the time, she convinces me to try to get some sleep, and I decide to not go anywhere near my bedroom, and to sleep on the couch in the upstairs bedroom. While I'm laying in the bedroom, there's some moonlight coming through the gap in the window curtains. I start staring at the moonlight on the wall, and it looks like there's a grasping hand. I get the ominous feeling of being watched again, and I quickly turn on the lights, and just sit there staring at the spot for an hour or more. I choose to go downstairs to try and cool off. While I'm going down the stairs, and get to the entrance of the house, I get a serious feeling of someone standing right behind me, but as usual, there's nothing. I even turn on the lights to outside, just to check if there should be something out there, but nothing. I start walking down towards the living room, and it's like something is just trolling me. Weird sounds, like something/someone is hitting something with a finger. Right when I get down into the living room, there comes like this high PLING sound from a iron/copper can we have standing on a shelf, and that does it. I decide to wake up my parents and talk about them with all the shit, and I can't hold in my tears because I'm scared shitless, and can't withstand the pressure anymore.\n\nNow a couple of days ago, I was sitting at my laptop in the dark, with a bit of moonlight on the wall. Then, a shadow goes over it, and I get the feeling of being watched again. I don't even dare turning on the lights, just glancing out in the dark sometimes. The next day I am laying in the dark again, and the same thing happens with the shadow, same feeling.\n\nWtf is going on?

The left lane is a straight-only lane, the middle lane is a lane to go straight or turn right (but not on red) and the right lane is a right turn whenever it's safe.  I was in the middle lane making for a right turn.  I finished my turn and to the right side of me, I see a woman trying to fly in front of me, because she was trying to cut me.  However, she tried too late and ended up ramming into my car.  Of course she tells the officer that the blame was on me and my mom flipped out (she wasn't there with me at the time of the accident) when she found that out.  [Here is one of the images of my car and its damage \\(sorry, Imgur wouldn't upload this image and had to use a different site\\)](http://i.minus.com/jcN9Cd4l1OFeQ.JPG).  I took some photos of her car where she hit me and it was only scratches (she was driving an SUV and I was driving a 4-door sedan).  The officer on the scene was \"neutral\" on it since he couldn't determined from the damage who could've caused it.  Of course, I'm not sure how this would go off since this is my, quote, \"first major fender-bender\".  I'm probably going to the gas station that was across the street tomorrow morning to see if they had any cameras capturing this moment.    \n\nHowever, this is a bit of bad news for my case next week.  See, my car is actually a lemon and I have a lawsuit going on with the car manufacturer to get them to return it.  That was scheduled to be on November 7th.

Doing Statements of Work, quoting hours, getting paid per project. Apparently, I was likable enough to get hired. So they sent me an official \"Offer of Employment\".\n\nThis was a document that stated I would be an \"at will\" employee. Meaning either the Employer, or I, could terminate employment without notice. Whatever, I'm 19 and was stoked to be their go to \"Backend\" guy.\n\nAnyways, after a dispute with payment periods (My Terms of Employment state I am to be paid every two weeks, they forgot to inform me of the random ass occurrences where that doesn't hold.), I found a line that states the terms aren't binding. The specific line is\n\n\"neither you nor any Company representative has entered into a contract regarding the terms or duration of your employment.\"\n\nShould I be concerned about this? Anyone else have a similar issue and/or contract? In the future, when I apply for a new job, is this an obvious red flag that my naivety missed?\n\nThe CEO and I are on very good terms. He took a chance on me (as I'm only 19 and already in charge of my own projects), and I appreciate that. Right now, I am currently the one who has been working with him the longest. (He has fired and or let go the others and brought in new people, keeping me). Today, I told him I thought I was to be paid and wasn't and he cut me a check right there on the spot; no questions asked.\n\nAnyways, I don't have a contract with them, including the part about the offer that I was up for a raise after 90 days. (It's been far over that now)\n\nRegardless, I am looking for a new job solely because I can not get along with the new project managers he hired and it's incredibly stressful when I email them MULTIPLE times to put me into contact with the designer so I have the assets I need to complete the site, and then they try to pin why it isn't done, on me.

I don't even know how to start this off... maybe it is the wrong place for me to explain my situation and ask for some opinions... and help. But I really don't know who to turn to... or where... so here it is.\n\nI'm 23 years old, born in an Eastern European country, but currently live in a Scandinavian country, and have several issues and problems that have made my life a struggle. Down below is a list of things about me that might interest you if you would want to give me your two cents on my life. I would appreciate both positive and negative opinions.\n\n- I was raised by a strong single mother, and my grandmother, so was my sister. I have never had a father, because all I can remember is that he was away drinking... as he was an alcoholic.\n\n- I had to learn how to be a man from my mom, grandma and sister, because I don't have any male role models in my relatives, as most of them are also drunks, actually, and other are just bad people that hit their wives and treat others like dirt. Therefore I have no clue what it means to be a man or how to act like one, and the saddest part is that my only male role models growing up were... action heroes... Sylvester Stallone and Jean Claude Van-Damme. I adopted their slickback hairstyle and tried to be like them... which is of course... sad.\n\n- At the age of 13, my best friend at the time offered me homemade cocaine. I was smart enough to not accept it. I never talked to him again after the event.\n\n- I moved to a Scandinavian country at the age of 11 because of my mom, together with my sister, and honestly, the country I live in, which I won't mention here, is a great one. The issue is that we left all of my then friends behind, the same goes for my relatives, and I grew apart from them.\n\n- I don't get along with my stepfather, just my birthday, I got a card from my religious grandmother who wrote a poem about God loving me. My stepdad said after reading it: \"Well at least someone loves you\". Jokingly of course, but it still hurt.\n\n- In this new country, I learned the language quickly, yet had a hard time making friends. Even today at the age of 23 I struggle to get any friends. I always make an effort and am true to myself, even trying to be extra nice in the hopes of someone enjoying my company.\n\n- I have never had a girlfriend, only flings here and there, and I don't even know why, when I have given it a shot and have been rejected multiple times in the most awful ways imaginable.\n\n- I am still a ... you know... V. I can't even spell it... it is that difficult... it is pathetic... I know.\n\n- I feel that maybe I'm not worthy of finding love... I don't think any one can love me... I just have a weird thought that maybe I'm just meant to be loved by anyone... no one to care about me... which is a difficult thought, of course.\n\n- In school, I struggled to study because of the teacher's behavior and my fellow students' attitude towards me and others from other countries. I still remember my maths teacher saying: \"Ohh well... what don't you understand this time?\" Just by raising my hand in class. The first 5 months of school in my 10th year, I was made fun of... because I liked anime, horror and wrestling. I barely talked to anybody, all the while trying to make friends, while the people in the class already had their groups.\n\n- I have never been invited to a party or a get-together.\n\n- I got depressed during my 11th year in school and dropped out.\n\n- I don't celebrate birthdays because I don't have any friends, only 1 close one, and that's about it. Therefore I don't celebrate them because nobody that I even went to school with, cares to wish me a happy birthday, even though I always wish them. It is not a day of joy for me, but a day of sadness.\n\n- I'm about 6 foot 3, 260 pounds, overweight. I glothe myself with style though and always look groomed. because of my OCD, I showed daily, wash my hands every few hours and am always clean. I don't like the way I look and have tried to work out but the depression gets me down and lazy... hard to get out of the rut.\n\n- I have an anxiety disorder, which I hide well, as I'm very social and show no real signs of it. I also have OCD... I can't even go to bed without making a sound pattern with my mouth, touching the door handle 3 times in precise manner etc. I also have Borderline Personality Disorder, which means I have issues with my own self-worth, identity and self-image. I lose myself because I try to be different so people will like me and want to hang out with me. I also think I don't really look that good and criticize things far too much about myself. While other days I think I'm quite a good guy myself.\n\n- I always put other people before me. I care more about the happyness of others than my very own. Whenever I do something, I always want the people that are with me to have fun, otherwise I will feel sad that they did not enjoy themselves. I'm a giver to the fullest.\n\n- I'm a good guy, although I have done a few things in the past that could be frowned upon, I have never bullied anyone, not even subliminally. I always want to be friends with the ones that don't have any, alienaiting myself from the popular groups that I might be able to be a part of.\n\n- I try not to drink much because my father was an alcoholic, and I occasionally only smoke cigars, not cigarettes, because it helps me to relax. I don't pop pills and never have. I don't take any meds, never have.\n\n- Because of my severe depression when I dropped out of school, because people thought I was dumb, all of my relatives, I contemplated suicide. I actually almost went through with it at the age of 18, but then realized all the things I have to live for.... things and the people I love. Because I have 1 good friend and a great mom and sister.\n\nI feel that God is trying to push me... to see how far he can push a human. Just to find a breaking point.... while silly, that's one of the few ways I have been trying to come to terms with my life. I feel depressed on and off, with some days feeling like a funeral, while others I feel fine, happy and joyful. I love those days where I'm happy... I like myself more then as well.\n\nI know this is a long text... most will just leave after seeing this, but I'm really struggling, in tears while writing this. It ain't easy living a life like that when people around you are living the one you want and I don't know how to achieve it... I don't know how to fix things... or start over.... feels kind of hopeless right now.","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/offmychest/comments/2kya2l/im_23_years_old_i_have_no_friends_never_had_a/"}

She has never done this until this month, and they've lived together peacefully for the last year.  More than that, I just found out that they don't do this when my husband feeds them -- which makes me think that this is relevant to me being pregnant.

It simply can't.   \n   \nShe does have a history of being protective of puppies and babies.

You can look now.\"\n\nThe car pulls up the gravel driveway as I remove my blindfold, blinking in the bright afternoon light. I grin at the sight of the big cabin as the car rolls to a gentle stop. It looks like a summer camp, with it's large wooden cabins and rustic atmosphere; and it's all for just us two! You note the excitement in my eyes as you open the door and clip a small leash onto my collar, making me stand up and swiftly unlocking my handcuffs, only to pull my hands behind my back and close them again with a gentle click.\n\n\"Wouldn't want you to get away now, would we?\" You whisper in my ear, making me blush. We both know that we're miles away from anyone else, so there's not much I could do to get away, even if I wanted to. With a tug on my leash, you begin leading me inside; gently pulling every time I slow down to admire the sights. Closing the door behind me, I can hear a whirrrrr as it locks automatically. Sealed shut. I look around the room in wonder. If this is how the entrance looks, I can't begin to imagine what the rest of the house is like! Grand paintings of various landscapes hang on the walls, beautifully painted sunsets and meadows and mountains and forests. To the right of the door is a small table with some pretty purple flowers in a vase, and a shiny, metallic keypad on the left. It downs on me that if someone were crawling, the keypad is too high for them to reach. It would need to be done by someone standing upright. You chuckle as the handcuffs finally come off for real this time, along with the leash, and you catch me nervously eyeing the solidly locked door.\n\n\"Don't worry, Princess. It's just to make sure you stay until your..... Rehabilitation... is complete. You can't get out now; and even if you could, there's nowhere to run before somebody catches you and brings you back. I strongly urge you not to try that, because it will just make things far less enjoyable for you. You told me you wanted this, and you trust me, right?\"\n\nI nod and you grin softly. \"Good girl. Now, there are a few.... Rules while you're here. First....\" You reach over onto the table and pick up a dull grey shirt and track pants. \"This is what you'll be wearing while you're here. If you're a good girl, you may be given the privilege of wearing far nicer clothes. Now strip!\" I obediently remove my long, white cotton skirt and light pink top, continuing when you gesture to remove my underwear as well. I hand you the clothes, folded neatly, before you give me my new wardrobe and look at me expectantly until I've re-dressed myself. Quickly, I stand in front of you, clad only in the pants and shirt. You haven't given me any underwear, socks, or even shoes, and I open my mouth to protest, but one glare from you and I quickly rethink that decision.\n\n\"Second,\" you say, \"Absolutely no speaking. No music, no humming, no whispering or noise of any kind. A good slave must be quiet. There may be areas in the camp where you will be allowed speech, but only when you are ordered to speak. I, or one of the other Owners here, will decide when you speak and what you say. Do you understand?\"\n\nI open my mouth again and quickly close it before nodding. You know how much I have a hard time keeping quiet. I've gotten punished more than once for it.\n\nYou smile again, \"Good girl. You're learning quickly. And the third and final rule is 'good girls take their pills.' Open up.\"\n\nI open my mouth and you drop a small, nondescript white pill into my mouth, handing me a glass of water, I swallow obediently and you nod in approval. I wonder to myself what the pill does, but it's hard to tell. I don't feel very different.\n\n\"Now, I know you're wondering just why exactly we're here. Well, we're here to train you to be a perfect slave. My perfect slave; and to do that, we needed a perfect place for that. Luckily, a friend of mine runs a.... Let's call it a camp, that specializes in training slaves like you to be their absolute best. These are not my rules, they are enforced on every single submissive who goes through this program. Who knows? Perhaps we'll find another Owner and their slave here? That would be fun, wouldn't it, Princess?\"\n\nI blush and look at the ground, nodding. You grin coyly, turning on your heel and leading me down a long hall and into a giant room. The walls completely blank, painted stark white. The only objects in the room are a white throw pillow, and a table about 5 feet in front of it; on top of which is some cloth-covered object. You point at the billow and I kneel down facing the table., noting how warm the room is. It's not uncomfortable, but a relaxing warmth. You reach over and, with a flourish, remove the cloth, uncovering.... A beautiful wooden metronome. I look at you quizzically, but you turn my head back to the wooden box as you set it slowly ticking back and forth. \"That's it, Princess. Just watch the pendulum... And focus on my voice....\" My eyes are instinctively drawn to the only thing that isn't white in the stark room, and I find myself following the pendulum as it swings back... And forth.... Back.... And forth.... I feel my eyes beginning to droop. \"That's a good girl\" you say softly. \"Just relax. It feels so nice. Now, I'm going to count to 10; and as I do, you'll get more and more relaxed. Feeling even warmer, and even more focused on my voice... Ready?\" I don't even respond, my eyes are glued to the swinging metronome. Aware of each tick, tick, tick, as it swings back... And forth... I let out a gentle moan and you smile to yourself. You're trying to hypno-.... Hyp-.... My thoughts slow down. It's too hard to think. Everything feels warm and fluffy as you continue speaking. \"Perfect. Just relax as I say 10.... 9.... 8.... Deeper and 7..... 6.... 5.... Feeling sleepy FOUR me... 3.... 2.... 1.... SLEEP\"\n\nI barely notice when everything goes black. All I remember is you speaking, saying... Something. And the tick, tick, ticking of the pendulum....\n\n-------\nSo, I hope that was a good enough prompt! A little about myself: My name's Alexis, I'm 5'9\", about 140 lbs, short brown hair, glasses, 36B cup, I love wearing skirts and tights, anything really feminine. I like generally being Submissive, but I also love bondage, pet play, collars, and mind control/brainwashing/hypnosis/Operant Conditioning. (In case that last one wasn't completely obvious. ;) )\n\nI really want to experiment with being hypnotized and brainwashed (ESPECIALLY hypnotized. With metronomes, which is a VERY big fantasy of mine.). What I don't want is a magical, \"You're a slave now, let's fuck\" RP. I understand that normal conditioning is boring and you'd rather get to the sexy bits. (I would too. Trust me.) But forcing me to obey and shaping me as you do so is the goal here. And I honestly find the slow conditioning and brainwashing bits to be far sexier than just forcing me to have sex. It's all about subtlety and control and building up to it.\n\nIt doesn't need to pick up where I left off, I just wrote that so people get a general idea of what I want. I might fight the conditioning. But we both know that sooner or later, I'll fall even deeper and lose even more control.\n\nMy only limits are actual bestiality, (As opposed to pet play.) bathroom play,and blood/gore.\nI'm looking for an RP partner who's articulate and has at least a basic grasp of the English language. Someone who sends me more than the usual two or three sentences. I'm not talking pages, here, but a paragraph or so would be nice.\n\n**REPEAT:** If you send me a message full of \"Hey bby u wan sum fuk?\" I will call you out on it, and my words will be unrelenting and harsh.\n\n(Note: This is super long because I tend to get carried way for prompts. Please don't think you need to do posts of this length!)\n\nFeel free to PM me if you want to play, and we'll see if we're compatible. How do you go about molding me into your perfect slave? What rules do you lay down? What methods of conditioning do you use? Do we really meet up with other slaves and their Owners? Or are we all alone for my training? (I don't mind either way, but having a second slave there could potentially be fun. Having us go under together, having two minds to play with.... mmm)\n\nI'm always looking for RP partners and, because I'm feeling EXTRA naughty tonight; any Mistresses or female-identified Dominants will receive priority, but gentlemen, don't let that stop you from controlling my dirty little slave mind. Any comments below telling me to PM/kik you will be promptly ignored. I hate when people do that. And if you've read this far, put your favorite colour as the title of your PM.","media":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2kyags","gilded":0,"archived":true,"id":"2kyags","num_comments":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":true,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"Lezzisabimbo","stickied":false,"from_id":null,"created":1414818829,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2kyags/19_f4a_hypnoslave_camp/","edited":false,"score":7,"quarantine":false}

(it was the type specifically made for shower use if it makes a difference)  I've had amazing results with it on my legs aside from missing some spots. \n\nSince it did the same as expected, I did some touchup shaving, leaving the aching parts of my labia alone. It went ok, was smooth, but still had a little stubble. I put some stretch mark cream on it as a moisturiser as it's the only thing I had. I guess it was /okay/ after that, but the stubble was very painful especially when touching myself in a way that pushed the hair to point upwards. \n\nNow today, it's about two days later, and the stubble pain is absolutely ridiculous. I took a look and I've got horrible stubble and ingrown hairs and I'm crying and really regretting this experience. How can I make myself not hurt so much?

I'm a little nervous posting here as this is the first time I posted anything like this online. This isn't the first time you guys herd anyone say they are depressed and want to kill themselves,  but what makes me different is I have friends,  a good family,  have many hobbies and things I'm good at,  and don't have a problem with the way I look.  Why should I be depressed right? Well it's all about who I am.  Mentally.  I think I'm a piece of shit of a human being for many reasons.  First off,  I've been addicted to porn for a good amount of time.  Like 6-7 years or something (I'm 20 by the way) and cant stop,  I get upset and frustrated with small things that are no big deal usually, I feel as if I just cause pain and suffering for others I'm close to.  Like just recently I made a \"joke\"  to a friend that really offended him and I feel really shitty because of it.  We worked it out and we're still friends and he forgave me but I just feel like a horrible dick. I can't live with myself.  I'm a porn addicted asshole that has no self respect and just hates everything. I'm trapped in this stupid state of mind and cant seem to change.  I want to kill myself but won't because I'm to scaired to and don't know what will happen to me after so you don't have to worry about that.  I often think of death though.  I havent had a girlfriend since I was 12 because thers not too many girls where I live and there all drunken redneck whores.  I often picture the girl of my dreams and what I want her to be.  When I look at myself and how I am I feel like a Hippocrate because if she was like me I'd hate her.  I guess she is also a picture on what I want myself to become mentally.  I don't know what to do.  Thers so much more on this but if I went on I'd wright I fucking book.  I've been depressed since I was probally 14. Anyone have any advice? And anyone else have a similer problem? Thank you for your time.\n\nEdit: sorry for such a not so serious user name on a subject like this.
