I first tried this with the full motion and immediately got a little dizzy,so I found the option for static background. I found no motion sickness at all. The menus are kind of confusing but I eventually found out how it all works. This game is pretty cool. The soundtrack is good,and really, better than beat saber. The difficulty levels are perfect. Normal was actually failrly easy at first and I clicked up to hard right away. After a few tries I turned the full motion back on and found I could do it with no sickness. Though I didn't push it and switched back and forth from these two options. If you have a quest then this game is a no brainer buy. There is a high score posted at the bottom of the song. But I could find no local leaderboard, which is kind of a bummer,and my only con for this game.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"OculusQuest","subreddit_id":"t5_p2wzd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest","subreddit_subscribers":85631,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Synth riders opinion from old guy.","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/dpwdm4\/synth_riders_opinion_from_old_guy\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

We had sex 2 days prior to that on that same bed, and I did tell her that. Of course I'm not mad at the girl or jealous or hold anything on her, because she doesn't know what's going on. He probably didn't even tell her I was living there. \n\nWe were  engaged for a short while, talked about having kids, we never left each other's sides for 2 years almost 3. I told him a lot I would definitely get back together with him in the future if it was right, but now I absolutely never can. He could have at least waited until I was fully moved out and the restraining order went through. I'm absolutely devestated and he doesn't even care.

We love each other very much however we have fee things in common. Sure I make her laugh all the time and the jokes and love for each other keep us always on our toes and keeps us entertained. Here is the problem, I'm like super addicted to music and music festivals that she is 100% not into edm mostly, we have been to a few festivals and she has made some effort into going with me and somewhat enjoying the time she has been there. But she has told me that she does not want to go to festivals anymore, instead she wants to do family things and take trips to places, I'm totally fine with this because I want this too. But she says she will not go to festivals with me no matter what and that I kind of over play the edm songs I like and artists I like. She wont budge about coming to festivals with me but I budge on taking family trips anywhere she wants to go. Is it unfair for me to feel like I should cage my feelings and likes in music and never ask again for her to come with me to festivals? even though that's what makes me incredibly happy and that's where I have fun as a couple I though that's where we can forget that we have kids and just have fun the both of us alone. I have been putting my feelings aside about it but they have slowly crawled back making me feel so sad and alone inside. Please any advise would be appreciated.

I graduated highschool in 3 years and currently do not attend a college due to the cost of a degree and the fact that I have no idea what I really would like to do in life. \nI work for a pest control company as a salesman and I do pretty good for myself. Some of my hobbies include- training MMA(mixed martial arts), watching movies and listening too \"The flatbush zombies\". I also enjoy playing with my Cat, his name is Socks and hes my baby. \n\nWhat I look like, i wish i knew had to upload a picture because saying what I look like over text just doesn't do me justice\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70  \n\nI'm 6'2 with broad shoulders and bright blue eyes\u2764. I have dirty blonde hair and freckles. I'm supposed to wear glasses but dont because I'm self conscious and dont like the way I look with them on. I'm have an average body build nothing specific but I go to the gym every day so I can get back into my fighting shape for MMA. \n\nNow the kinky stuff \n\nMy Kinks- Coddling, Wax play, Pet names. Collars, bondage, Impact play, light bruising, hickies, light crossdressing, choking, soft humiliation and pegging \n\nMy hard limits, No piss\/poop, heavy brusing, humiliation, and anything that's going to leave permanent mental or physical problems.\n\nI would like an IRL relationship so if you live around 3 hours from Virginia beach your a perfect candidate, but if you live farther but feel youd be a good match than feel free to message me \n\nClosed mouths dont get fed.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BDSMpersonals","subreddit_id":"t5_2smyd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BDSMpersonals","subreddit_subscribers":93910,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M4F] #VIRGINIABEACH SUBMISSIVE IRL\/ONLINE","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BDSMpersonals\/comments\/dpwsuj\/m4f_virginiabeach_submissive_irlonline\/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}

I've been training BJJ on and off for about 10 years. I'm currently a 3 stripe purple belt. I got my purple belt in 2015 and trained for about 2 years before deciding to just do standup  came back into training BJJ consistently (3x a week) in February of 2019. I'm 35 years old and work full time.\n\nI was at the same gym until 2019 when I moved too far away. I don't know if the guys at my old gym just weren't as good (the lineage was solid), if it was rust from not training for a few years, or just random factors, but I tend to just get my ass handed to me at this new place. I mean that I struggle submitting\/sweeping white belts and I get tapped out by blue belts.\n\nNow I really like my instructor, he's a high level guy who competes often and does well and he's genuinely a good guy. He keeps telling me that I just need to be more patient, that I need to work my game, not go into my opponents game, it's just time on the mat, that it's my mindset that's holding me back.\n\nSo in addition to training the group classes I did several private lessons, but I just don't think this stuff has stuck. I STILL get tapped out by 1 stripe blue belts who I'm bigger than. It's gotten to the point where guys at my gym will ask 'where did you train before?' as if to say 'you suck' and it's embarrassing when I'm in a fundamentals class and the highest ranked. Clearly I can't defend my rank and feel like an impostor.\n\nThis is a gigantic point of frustration where I'm considering quitting or at the very least switching schools and seeing if I can find instruction better suited to me.\n\nI think the issue is a few things:\n\n1. There doesn't seem to be a curriculum or continuity in the instruction. One day we do one technique then the next class something totally different with no segue in between.\n2. I make the same mistakes and they don't seem to be corrected. Now to my instructors credit during privates he does correct me. During group classes there are too many people so I don't get as much 1 on 1 instruction.\n3. The experience of the past 8 or so months has just demolished much of my confidence in my ability, there are times where I just leave because of the frustration.\n4. I sometimes feel that I'm kind of viewed as a pity belt and as a $ sign. The older guy who isn't going to get good but just keeps paying and showing up.\n\nNow I want to do two things:\n\n1. Have a direct conversation with my instructor about these concerns, I don't want to offend him but I want to be straight.\n2. I want to check out other schools in the area and see if they are better suited.\n\nAny recommendations on these action items? Thank you all.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"bjj","subreddit_id":"t5_2qn02","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/bjj","subreddit_subscribers":187089,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Need Authentic Opinion Switching Schools \/ Frustration","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bjj\/comments\/dpwwug\/need_authentic_opinion_switching_schools\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

If you want to edit the plot\/change it we can discuss that as well. I do enjoy role playing this one but I\u2019m open to hearing other plots. I will be playing a male and a futa character in this plot. I am flexible and enjoy playing other characters but prefer to stick to my main Dom Male character. I do not play strictly futa. I am moving to telegram\/discord after hearing about the kik shutdown, I would prefer you message me on those. If you are a male please be able to play another character besides a male (as in a femboy, futa, female etc.) And without further delay, here\u2019s the plot.\n\n15,000 years after world war three had occurred civilization was thriving. As a result of a mass extinction event caused by a nuclear winter the world had changed, and humans had evolved into a new species, called Anthros. Each Anthro race had unique characteristics which set them apart from others. As a result of the radiation each Anthro is born with a unique magical gift which was caused by mutations. There are a few common gifts, such as certain levels of control over the elements (ice wind fire air etc) the more precise the control the rarer the ability. However there were also rarer abilities, the more obscure the power the rarer it was, these powers ranged from telekinesis to shape shifting to healing.\n\nOur story is set on the continent of Betra, one of the three continents of the known world. There are many countries and city states throughout Betra.\n\nThis world is a medieval fantasy world, devoid of guns and such. Humans had progressed far enough with technology where they had begun to imbibe things with special runes, these runes enabled Anthros to study ancient ruins and make enchanted weapons. Besides enchanted weapons the only magic was that which one was born with.\n\nWhen you message me please include your ref and a short backstory. Also if you prefer to play multiple characters or not. I\u2019ve found this story can get interesting with more than 2 main characters. I also do not mind playing an extra character, so if you\u2019re interested in that just tell me.\n\nMy backstory and ref: https:\/\/cdn.furrtrax.com\/\/uploads\/14298\/4583f56f51584465ddc0c2a90c0f6775.jpg I was the prince of a small relatively technologically advanced eastern kingdom, that is, until scouts had found traces of the wolven empire preparing for an assault. We had known of the constant expansion the empire was undergoing and had kept an eye on them, we hadn\u2019t realized the power their army had. Frantically my kingdom prepared for the attack and failed. We were overrun by their numerous forces. I had been next to my father as we fought to the death in the fields before our capital. I woke up, alone in a burnt farm full of corpses and in front of my burning kingdom. I managed to escape the wolven scouts and began a journey towards the west. I am 20 years old, use two gauntlets and a staff as weapons, am 7\u20195 ft and am an equine. Being of the equine race grants me super strength, and high stamina. My magical gift is my unique ability to freeze time and move through it for 5 seconds effortlessly, each second more adds more effort.\n\nMy secondary character https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/oeqoX10_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium\n\n(Yes I play as a futa as well) Alice had waited her whole life for this moment. Training within the wolven infiltration corps she had been assigned a mission. To kill a rather large equine spotted in the western forest, just before the draconian mountains. She could finally prove that she wasn\u2019t any less of a soldier for having a pair of tits..... or larger than average hips. Alice is a northern fox, born in the central territories of the wolven empire her rather tall stature (6\u20195) and intimidating control over the ice element made along with her....intersex situation made her rather unpopular during adolescence. She is 21 years old.\n\nWell those are my two main characters.

Although my experience as a DD has been mostly limited to online, I've discovered a lot about myself along the way - primarily that the DDLG lifestyle is a very good fit for who I naturally am.  \n\nI've always naturally been a caregiver type.  Whether it be in friendships or relationships, I find joy in making those around me happy and cared for.  I'm at my best when I'm helping someone else be their best.  It's a role that has proven to be as beneficial for me as it is for others.  Ideally, I would be looking for someone who has a good balance of neediness and independence, that allows us to help each other grow and excel.\n\nI've also always been attracted to the types of personalities that most of you littles possess - playful, curious about the world, fun loving, and caring.  Although the kink aspect of a DDLG relationship is something I'm incredibly into, I'm looking for someone I connect with on a strong emotional level first and foremost.  I want to be able to share most aspects our lives together, whether it be hearing about your day, telling you about mine, watching your favorite cartoon together, or going on fun adventures.\n\nFor those of you who find this meaningful, I'm 6'1, around 165lbs, have dark brown hair, hazel eyes, and have been working on starting a beard.

I actually originally planned to go straight into being a CO after high school but instead I went to school for automotive. I did that because all I ever had experience with was criminal Justice and law. So I didn't know if it was something I actually enjoyed or just knew. Turned out that I really enjoy it and after I graduate I am going to try and get hired as a CO. \n\nAnyway, I am a strong believer in justice, doing what is right, and doing what is fair. But an issue has been swirling in my head for awhile. \n\nFrom what I have been told and what I have read, sometimes doing what is right and fair, isn't the accepted thing to do. \n\nFor example, my sister works as a clerk at a Sheriff's Office and was a State Probation officer before that. She was telling me one day how Officer's would pull over a drunk driver, discover it was another Officer's wife\/husband, and let them go or at least call someone to take them home but not punish them. I told her I disagreed with that. I feel like no matter who you are, you shouldn't be let off. You still could get someone killed and was still breaking the law. \n\nShe also told me about an officer she knew who would make moonshine and sell it out of his own work vehicle to other officers. \n\nI also read about a cop seeing two other cops doing something really corrupt (I think they were beating a man who was already on the ground). He reported it to his superior who just told him to keep his mouth shut. He then reported it to the state and they put a stop to it but he then started getting threats and would have a rat on his windshield every morning. \n\nThere was also the story of the cops who pull over other cops that are speeding excessively for no reason, ticketing them, then it starting like a beef between police stations. Or the officer gets threats. \n\nLike how do you decide when to enforce the law and when to let it slide? Or should you ever let it slide?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"police","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhxd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/police","subreddit_subscribers":26118,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"How do you separate doing what is right and what is accepted?","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/police\/comments\/dpx2hb\/how_do_you_separate_doing_what_is_right_and_what\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I responded. Here's the not-so-subtle reply.\n\n\"Hello,\n\nMy name is Mary (31 years) and my husband's name is David (39) , we are easy going and very kind. I'm a bit hard of hearing but I hear pretty well with my cochlear implant. We need a caregiver for our two Dogs (Kona and Nala), this position could be permanent or temporary depending on your availability. I'm moving with my husband to your area, he just got promoted and transferred from his place of work, and I won't be able to do some things with my Fur Babies because I'm 6 Months pregnant, I and my husband have been married for 6 years and this is going to be our first child and we want everything to move smoothly till I put to bed. Our furry babies are friendly, Kona (1 years, 2 months) is a German shepherd, David got him in London and he is considered our first child while Nala is a Labrador Retriever, 1 years 8 months, he's friendly and loves to play our second child. They are not aggressive and not temperamental around other dogs but Nala can be naughty sometimes.... Lol, they are quite spoiled and very adorable. They both receive Bark-boxes every month and allowed on all furniture in our home despite Nala's shedding. They've truly been one of the greatest blessings in my life and I'm very fortunate that David loves them as much as I do.\n\nWe'd need you to brush their coats and take them for walks at least once a week, they are well trained and won't give you any problem, I can manage with their feeding and when ever you come around you can also feed them. We would be happy if you'd love them like we do. They're quite adorable, our babies will be arriving a day before us and my husband wouldn't mind to pay you to secure your service before our arrival as well as for you to get some dog food, brush and other things needed for them.\n\nYou'll be working for 3 days a week for at least three hours a day\/ 9 hours a week, we'd prefer to have fixed days but we can be flexible if your weekly schedule changes, just let us know ahead of time. You'll be coming to our house to look after the dogs.. We are willing to pay $35 per hour for both dogs. We'd need to know the days you'd be available.\n\nWhat is your zipcode so we can calculate your transportation cost if needed?\n\nTerms - \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3 DAYS FOR THE TOTAL OF 9 HOURS WEEKLY (3 HOUR DAILY)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Between 10am and 9pm\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nI hope you have read and understood all I have written as I want things to be done with sincerity and done the way I ask you to please, I'm very pleasant and show people around me that same gesture. I'd love to know more about you.\n\nHowever, you can let me know the time and days you will be available.. And what's your number in case my husband would want to chat with you?\n\nI will be waiting to hear from you.\n\nRegards\"\n\nSo yeah, *definitely* not sketchy at all.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TexasTech","subreddit_id":"t5_2rft2","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TexasTech","subreddit_subscribers":8660,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Response from that scam email","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TexasTech\/comments\/dpx7ti\/response_from_that_scam_email\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I was 7 or 8, but I remember asking myself why a police officer needed to be standing in the hallway of my school, and years later I learned who he was. It has scared the shit out of me since. He actually ate little kids, fed them to his neighbors in burgers, I try to forget, and time goes by and I do, but something always reminds me. It haunts me, that I could have been tortured, possibly raped and killed, and fed to people I grew up. It really fucked me up. I'm 28 now, and moved to North Dakota.

I barely remember much of it but I just liked the idea of fucking Naruto characters so there you go lol.\n\n*It was already a surprise that you managed to come over to my place during this blistering heatwave in the Hidden Leaf Village but it was another when you said you had a \"solution\" that would let us escape the heat and cool off. I was already content to just relax by the hot springs and watch Kiba's naked ass being lubed up but I always enjoyed getting some attention by you. I knew how much you enjoyed going all out with your schemes which usually involved us having sex over and over again until we needed to wash off.....before proceeding to have sex again. This was probably no different which is why i agreed to go back to your place.*\n\n*We arrived at your home shortly, my eyes firmly planted on you as I only imagined what you had in store for us. My jumpsuit was sticking to my skin at this point, that's the last time I wear nothing underneath this in a heatwave. You gestured towards the back of the house and led the way, all the while I heard your feet slap on the wooden floor that echoed in the empty house. I followed behind you as slid the door open, revealing a sight i hadn't truly seen before: It was an arena, large and very spacious that was about 60% covered in a dark black mat, which had a reflective glow on it that I soon realised to be oil, while the rest of the room was decorated with various accessories akin to that of a fighting arena, though not like any kind Kakashi sensei would have planned for us (though maybe in one of those pervy books of his). These included a wall adorned with outfits that would barely cover our bodies and more likely served as a way to tease each other, a shelving unit that consisted of many different types of liquids to apply onto the mat as means of keeping it slippery and covering us such as scented oils, syrup, grease and flavoured drinks,. I almost couldn't believe my eyes until you looked at me with a huge grin and spoke. \"Well Naruto, what do you think?.....\".*\n\nHey there! So this a totally different variation to my Sex Fighting Arena prompt. This time it's Naruto themed Since its already detailed in the excerpt above I'll just be brief about it. During a heatwave in the Hidden Leaf village, you decide to set up a fighting arena in your house and we decide to test it out with me since we're so close and are known to very active with each other sexually \ud83d\ude09.\n\nJust a little about myself, my names Josh, I'm 21 years old and am bisexual, but I'm only looking to do this with either a guy. I'd prefer if my partners were around my age so between 18-23 just because that's a preferred age for me with guys. I'm a top when it comes to the guys and never bottom so keep that in mind. I also don't mind trans guys or gender fluid people so don't be shy! \n\nIn terms of what is involved in the arena itself I've already got some ideas for what we can do in the arena. When it comes to the rules of the fighting arena it's very simple....there are no rules! Every dirty trick is available to use and nothing is off the table when it comes to fighting your oppenent. The only legitimate rule is to not actually hurt your oppenent so no blood or serious roughness, though I feel like our characters could take some hits compared to real life haha. Things like grappling, light jabs and using your whole body to overpower your oppenent are heavily encouraged.\n\nIn terms of characters we can play as I'm very open though my preferences would be Kiba, Sasuke, Naruto, Shikamaru, Itachi, Hozuki and a few others. I'm not a fan of older characters so keep that in mind. \n\nThe guidelines to the fighting arena are based on a game called 'You Suck Loser!'\n\n'You Suck Loser!' has three rounds to it and the aim of the game is to overpower your oppenent and shove your dick into their mouth, forcing them to suck it for ten seconds or more which results in you earning a point and winning the round. Earning all three points wins the game and the reward is getting to dominate your oppenent and empty your balls into them.\n\nI'd love to hear any ideas you have in mind, there's very little I'll say no to regarding ideas for this prompt since it's such a favourite of mine \ud83d\ude0f.\n\nKinks wise I'm generally limitless aside from a few obvious ones like scat, rape, piss, gore, vore, vomit and torture.\n\nMy kinks include: I have a pretty big foot fetish (your feet by the way), twinks, goths\/emos, femboys, slim or athletic bodies, power bottoming, bubble butt, smooth body, \nfurries, anthros, sluts, threesomes, group sex, rough sex, cum stuffing, light bondage, outdoors, oral, ass play, flexibility, nudism, sex games, excessive cum, teasing, details, flirting\/dirty talk, kissing, licking, biting, scratching, hair pulling, race play, wet sex, showers, confidence, romance, oil play, clothing and long srps. My main kinks would be the foot fetish, twinks, sluts, flirting, kissing, teasing and flexibility. Also if you can play as multiple characters then that's perfect but if you can't it's cool, just for some extra holes \ud83d\ude09. Also the foot fetish is kinda non-negotiable because it's such a big kink of mine, so please keep that in mind. \n\nI really hope you're interested. If so then DM me and we can discuss more. If you have any further questions then please don't hesitate to ask when you message me. When you message me please include your age, kinks, limits and a ref of whatever character you'd like to play. I've also got a lot of refs that we can use for your character if you're stuck for ideas. I think this would be a lot of fun to do with the right person so get in touch if you think that's you \ud83d\ude1c\n\nThanks! \ud83d\udc8b\n\nP.S. Through and through this is a purely smut based rp so if you're expecting anything other than that then please check elsewhere lol.\n\n*I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+*","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DirtyKIKRoleplay","subreddit_id":"t5_3kem5","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/DirtyKIKRoleplay","subreddit_subscribers":21587,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M4M] [Naruto: Sex Arena!]","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DirtyKIKRoleplay\/comments\/dpx8pv\/m4m_naruto_sex_arena\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

Since August, I've felt different and I don't know what caused it or what it is really. I'm an average high school student, I have ok grades (A's and C's) although I moved schools during 8th grade after my parents divorced and I don't have any friends at school currently. I've been smoking weed daily for about a year now which is part of what I think is causing it. I don't do any extra activities and most days consist of driving home, smoking, playing video games and watching videos until night and then do my homework.\n\nRecently, as of August, I've started having random moments where I feel almost a headache around the back of my head and I get a tightness in my chest. During these things, I usually have negative thoughts and I just feel awful, like sadness, anger and hopelessness had a child and gave it to me. It can be a couple hours long, to a day or it could be a couple minutes or seconds. It happens pretty much everywhere, even when I'm having fun. It's not constant all the time, like I just had a week or two where I felt fine\/ok smoking joints but I stupidly bought a thc cart and ruined that fine feeling. Now it's back to before but sometimes worse. It can be really intense and I feel my heart rate start going or it can be mild. I've also noticed my memory and focus has been degrading. It's hard to remember things people said even a couple hours after whatever interaction I had. Even when I'm listening to people, sometimes I don't hear or acknowledge what they're saying. I'm also really tired at school and in the morning but have more energy at night.\n\nI've been seeing a therapist for a little bit, but so far it's been the same.

He has been an amazing and kind father throughout my entire childhood and I attribute a lot of my success to him.  My father (65 years old) has been pretty much single ever since my parents divorced when I was around 5 years old. I am 21 now and I am away in college as a senior.\n\nIn this call, he basically details out to me that he met a 19 year old girl on a \"website\" on October 1st and that they have moved in together in his apartment. In justifying this, he lays out that she has borderline personality disorder and that her parents have Baker Acted (involuntarily committed her into a mental institution) her **25 times.** He then goes on to say that she has had an anorexic disorder, has cut herself on many occasions, and has **severe** emotional problems. She also has sleeping problems and is not able to sleep at her parents place. Because of these mental problems, my father details about how she really just needs help and that she is a very sweet person that needed to move away from her parents. When I suggested to him about getting her therapy, he stated that he read somewhere that people can just \"grow out\" of borderline personality disorder? That doesn't seem like it would be true especially given the severity.\n\nSo, she has moved in with my father and has been sleeping there the past couple weeks. I have no idea if they've had any romantic contact. My father's justification is that he wants to help her get better emotionally (which I know is true) by moving out of her seemingly abusive parents place. Also, he'll be getting some \"company\" since I haven't been home and will not be returning home after college.\n\nThis whole thing greatly disturbs me. Not only about the **massive** age difference but the fact that she has severe emotional problems that my father is not equipped to handle. What if she attacks my father? How do I even begin to take this? I'm still in shock and I worry that this will affect my father and our relationship forever.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationship_advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0cn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/relationship_advice","subreddit_subscribers":2846299,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Dad is shacking up with a emotionally-damaged 19 year old while I'm away at college","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/dpxfd1\/dad_is_shacking_up_with_a_emotionallydamaged_19\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I use this culdesac to turn around literally almost every day, so I've become quite accustomed to doing so. Obviously, today was Halloween and there was a number of kids out there trick-or-treating (around 5pm) so I took it slow on the way in, going about 20km\/h (like 12mph freedom units) towards the end while keeping an eye out. I turned around slowly, did the shoulder-checks on the way around, whole shebang. There was only a few cars parked on the side of the road, and I was driving in the middle with ample space so I wasn't overly concerned about kids jumping out in front of me, and felt I would have enough time to stop if such a thing happened.\n\nSuddenly, this guy jumps out in front of me and does a \"stop\" hand motion. I'm like uhh alright, so I slow down with ample time and roll down my window because clearly he wants to talk to me.\n\n\"You're going to fast buddy, it's Halloween.\"\n\nI clearly knew it was Halloween. But alright. \"I know man, I was going 20 heading in and then slowed down at the end.\"\n\n\"Doesn't matter. Too fast. There's kids. Have a good night buddy.\"\n\nThen he just walks away back to a group of other older people watching their kids. So I'm like \"yeah you too buddy\" then drive off and park my car. For reference, I'm 18, and I've seen this guy around before as he lives a few houses down. However, this is literally the first time I've ever talked to him.\n\nAnyways, was I going too fast, or was he being a little extra protective of his kids? Obviously it's hard to tell without being there, but is 15-20km\/h (9-12mph) too fast? Am I wrong for being a a tad miffed and feeling like he was being a little demeaning with his \"buddy\" usage (I'm a young looking 18 y\/o)?

This time it's going to be a little different. Some people have that already spoken to me might have heard of my boyfriend, Jason. Well, we have been together for a little while now, and we're both here, looking to try this out for each other. After writing this up, I want to apologize if I've made any mistakes in writing this, if you could please point them out that would be great. Please allow me to introduce myself for anyone new, I am Kathy, a student studying in the US. I'm 19, studying CS at a school on the west coast. I'm 5'6'', black hair that is just past my shoulders, I'm athletic and slim, pale, and I think people generally find me pleasing. I have mostly dated back home but I have dated some people from school here, thought I think I prefer guys here, and now that's evidently true. Jason is 6'2'', blonde hair, a more quiet and shy person unless around friends or passionate topics arise. Also a healthy gym rat. Helping me to get into it more and more haha, I've always been good but having some definition would help.\n\nWe're looking to talk to people on here, answer questions or just see where it takes us. Open to talking to guys or girls. I generally answer any question you have and my boyfriend will try to do the same, I anticipate many just because of who I am, as the preference is no secret on this subreddit. Feel free to ask me about me, my home, or anything in between. We're in my room doing some work on the side and seeing if we can get some good conversation here. It is generally expected for people to place their preferences in their post, but I can't give more indication other than I am very much into the romantic, and the rough has its place sometimes if done properly, but not too far in that direction, and Jason generally agrees.\n\nI'm open to most things, I have had people offer to discuss (and erm, some people yell at me) about politics, about current events, things like that, like I said, I know most people come here with certain topics in mind but, if you'd like to discuss other things, I am more than interested. Especially with Jason here, that could be interesting. Another topic would be well, if you've ever been with someone like me, tell me how the time with well, someone like me, was like for you, or if thats still the relation you are in (or if you were the same with your own Jason haha).\nAs a bonus for this time that I'm posting well, I'd like to try raceplay. Since talking to people raceplay as a topic has come up and I'd like to truly try it. This is out of character forwardness for me, but yes we together have not done it. Guilt is a factor, and Jason feels truly guilty. By the way please put an animal in your subject line to make sure you read this. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I welcome feedback for the future as well, even if you do not want to necessarily talk. P.S.: I posted and forgot to mention, since people will ask about the name, it is a joke within friends of mine, and I made this account for lurking around. Will probably not help me in posting here but I thought it was funny.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dirtypenpals","subreddit_subscribers":242412,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[FM4A] Chinese international student and local boyfriend looking to talk","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtypenpals\/comments\/dpxhvj\/fm4a_chinese_international_student_and_local\/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}

I use the weekends to have some fun in the backroads outside town but I also do some city driving.

Lastly, I've never gotten to ride an Elise. Everything that I like about it comes from youtube videos, etc. They are very rare here and if I committed to one I would have to buy one abroad and import it. \n\nWould love to get input from you guys in case you have owned one or more of these and get a feel for what the comunity thinks. \n\nTl;dr: can't chose between these cars cause they all have their strong points and this indecision has been going on for 2 months but has roots long before.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"whatcarshouldIbuy","subreddit_id":"t5_2ys2t","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/whatcarshouldIbuy","subreddit_subscribers":60648,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Decide between Elise\/Mx5\/TT","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/whatcarshouldIbuy\/comments\/dpxhw5\/decide_between_elisemx5tt\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Occasionally I get asked for favours, and I don't mind. My upstairs neighbour (75ish) needed help activating a Visa gift card, no problem, last night the little old lady across the hall (70ish) asked if I wouldn't mind carrying her yard waste bin out for pick up, I said sure!\n\nShe asked if I could do it before work in he morning, I leave around 6am but I told her I'd take it out when I put out my trash the night before. She was worried about kids getting up to mischief since it's Halloween but I assured her it'd be fine, it's cold and rainy and kids will all be in early.\n\nSo, sure enough, the weather report was right, it's a cold crappy night, not many kids out, so I put out my garbage and compost and I put her yard waste out.\n\nJust a moment ago I heard some noise in the hall and I peeked through the peephole to see her struggling to drag the bin inside and leave it by her door. \n\nNow, to be perfectly clear, I don't think I'll be petty about it and I'll just put it back out in the morning as she's clearly demanding, but would I be the asshole if I just walked past the bin in the morning? I'm all for helping out but it just seems odd to me to ask for such a minor favour and yet demand that it be done to her specifications and at my inconvenience. \n\nNot only that but... If kids are gonna make trouble there'll be a mess anyways since everyone else in the building has their bins out, only hers is safely inside...

I was both feeling good because the situation suited me and bad because I felt like a loser and a loner for not going to the party.\n\nUntil... until I recieve a text from this girl. She was at my uni when we met and we spent quite some time together but she was a bit older than me (I'm 22 and she's 26) and I always thought we had some kind of sis-bro relationship. Last time I spoke to her I messed up because I forgot she was leaving town for some humanitarian mission and acted like a dick when she pointed it out. Today she wrote to me because she met a guy that looked like me and after discussing for a while, she just openly said that she liked me all this time and listed a number of my qualities and she even talked about and accepted my \"weirdness\". She just mentioned I was hard to get intimate with and that she could never express it and that she felt like doing it now.\n\nWhat the fuck.\n\nBut that's not everything. Just about 20 minutes later I get texted by a friend who was out in town because he thought I was out too. I explained to him I was home and he just said \"ok I love you\" out of drunkness. I said I love you too (because bromance) and also \"that's the second love declaration I get this evening\". Now, out of the blue, he just said \"I understand \\[another girl\\]\". I'm like \"what ?\". He replied \"For loving you bro\". It was not a joke, he's the kind of guy to be honest when drunk. This is a girl I was also sure I was suuuuper friendzoned although we get along very well, and now I'm told she also likes me ?\n\nWhat the actual fuck\n\nI'm just realizing that I have no clue about what I'm doing with girls in my life. I thought I knew a bit about the subject after 2 long relationships and several shorter ones, but bullshit. I'm still not capable of getting hints from girls I literally see everyday and I have no idea what to do now. What kind of situation is this ? I just wanted to chill and play video games and now I'm in this situation where I don't even know what to say to them. I'm striving for relationships but I cannot see the opportunities I have with people I already know and appreciate (for real I considered a relationship with both of these girls). Who knows how many things went unnoticed this way... It's depressing, I'm so afraid of missing opportunities in my life this way (not only with girls). I'm living like a half-time doomer for absolutely.

I am 23 years old and really love staying in and just like hanging out with my family, I am currently a full time grad student and go to an internship 24 hours a week. I also work part time on the weekends so I usually have a pretty busy week and the times where I have nothing going on I really love to just stay home and not really do anything. I used to get kind of sad because I would see other people my age posting on social media all of this stuff that they're doing and I thought maybe I was missing out on something. I always feared that when I was older I would have no interesting stories to share of my youth. I feel like a lot of people my age like going out to places like bars and I honestly hate bars so much. The just make me so anxious and uncomfortable. They're just so loud and dark and I really don't need a bunch of strangers to be that close to me you know? I'm a fan of a more lowkey night. I like staying home and watching Netflix or YouTube, hanging out with my dog, or even watching something with my mom. When I do go out with friends I like to do something more on the lowkey side, too. The issue with that, though, is that sort of stuff doesn't really make for interesting Instagram posts or exciting stories. So on social media terms I am a boring person. I don't have a lot of crazy stories to tell people of my wild nights out. I'm a pretty uninteresting person, but that is also very subjective. Who gets to define what's interesting? I don't want to just live my life to impress the people who follow me on social media because let's be honest, I highly doubt they even really care what I'm doing. I do have the memories that I've made by spending time with the people who mean the most to me and that's just as good right? Not everything can be worthy of a post on Instagram and not everyone can be these extroverted individuals who love to go out and be surrounded by tons of people, some of us have to be just average and kind of boring and there's nothing wrong with that. \n\nSo yes, I'm a boring person and it's something that I've learned to become okay with.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"CasualConversation","subreddit_id":"t5_323oy","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/CasualConversation","subreddit_subscribers":1151323,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I'm a boring person and that's okay","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CasualConversation\/comments\/dpxp7l\/im_a_boring_person_and_thats_okay\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

A little back story before I start I'm 17 and my whole life I've always felt watched. Not 24\/7 but if I'm outside at night I almost always feel the eyes on me. It's not like when you feel a person watching you its always felt off. Not sinister but definitely not right. And when I was younger I used to suffer from intense nightmares.  There was always this woman with a scary smile that always showed her abnormally white teeth. She always wore a nice white dress. For some reason she always offered me an orange. She didnt exactly offer me it more just held it out to me as if  she wanted me to take it. She would always go on about how I need to come twitch her and when I refused shw would just tell me that one day I would go with her She was sometimes accompanied by... something it looked human but at the same time not. skinny and around maybe around  6'0 tall. It had stitches all around its body and it was always smiling in a similar way to the wonans smile only its smile literally went ear to ear and its teeth were as white as the woman's but in some spots they were coverd I'm a dark brownish substance and its stare felt as if it was staring past my eyes and into my soul. Continuing on one night I was out with some friends I live in providence RI and I was at a park called riverside its right next to my house and has a bike path that's pretty long. So me and my friends were smoking (weed) and I decided to go take a piss a little down the path but still clearly in view for my friends as I get a little paranoid at night. So I finished my piss and started walking back texting my mom on my phone then got a extra weird feeling and just stood there wondering why. Then I saw my friends staring at me with worried\/alarmed looks.  Then I got the worst feeling of anxiety and decided to turn around but saw nothing. I went to ask my friends what happened but before I could even get all the way to then they started yelling at me to run so I didnt think twice and ran as if Michal Myers himself was behind me. We all got into my friends car and drove away then they started asking if I saw that. Fast forward a long conversation while i was walking my friends saw some sort of black figure come out a Bush and start looking at me a little before i stopped and when i turned to look it went back. Then asoon as I turned back around it popped its whole body out and just stood there. This was Their description of the thing. Its skin black. It seemed darker than the Darkness that surrounded us. It wasn't insanely tall and just looked like a skinny man except its arms stretched down to its knees and the thing that gets me the most is that they could all see an impossibly big smile. It stretched across a majority of its face and went ear to ear.

I used to hang around with some friends in the morning when I attended on campus classes but our schedules don't intermingle so I'm basically alone for most of the day and it's *boring* and *lonely*. I kind of miss talking about mutual stuff with people in front of me rather than on the internet. While that does happen, it's not exactly fun waiting 1-5 minutes for a response and in some cases 1-10 hours. Much easier to wait the few milliseconds for a snarky comeback lol.\n\nA little bit about me is that while I haven't really binged an anime or manga series in a few years, I still consider myself a huge nerd about that kind of stuff. To the point where my original plan to learn Japanese in high school was to watch anime without subtitles and read original Japanese manga... Yeah, laugh now, get it out of your system.\n\nBut I don't just like manga\/anime. I enjoy other fandoms too like Jurassic Park, LOTR, Harry Potter, GOT, Psych, some video games, horror movies and some other stuff like hobbies.

You don't know if I'm a serial killer or not. In any case, even if we don't meet, we can still be mutual dislikers of having a shitload of homework on our backs and complain about midterms and finals and maybe talk about mutual classmates?\n\nCongrats on making it this far as well!

Today I wanted to try something new and see where it goes. One of the topics that I've seen around here a lot lately is celebrities being paired up with partners who aren't famous themselves.

That's fun of course, but there are so many other kinds of famous women out there!\n\nToday I'd love to play an older female celebrity and her new boyfriend. Off the top of my head, the two characters I can think of for myself are Jennifer Garner or Julie Bowen (they're both older than me, but I think they fit great! I'm open to others too!). I'd love to see them paired with a younger guy, maybe a college athlete or rookie pro. She's old enough to be him mom, but their chemistry is perfect. When she comes to see him play she cheers louder than anyone, and in her hotel room later he pushes her to her absolute physical limits.
