Anyways on 2017 when I was 25 I hopped on finasteride, began taking 1.25 mg (5 mg split into 4) every day, I have to be quite frank and say I didn't noticed any change on my hair at all, I think it might be possible that it just helped maintain what I have. I keep taking finasteride but my hair keeps falling still so I decide to go to a dermatologist beginning 2021 and get professional help, and helps me out with minoxidil and stuff for my dermatitis, which actually works and I see better results in 3 months than I had in 4 years with only finasteride. However I began shedding later in spite of minoxidil and I feel like I only maintain what I have with some slight improvement and if I stopped using both I would legit have no hair I feel.\n\nAnyway that's the background, here's the important part, about erections, I've always considered myself a person with a high sex drive, constantly thinking about sex and doing your \"own business\", however I feel like in the last 3 years my erection quality and occurrence has dropped a lot, and I don't know if its because of finasteride or if its a normal AGING thing? Because I remember being a teenager and I could get hard just fantasizing about some hot girl, nowadays I can't get hard with my mind. I began having sex at 25 and while I have no problem there I've lost my boner on few occasions (less than 10% of encounters I'd say), but still. I have to wonder, is this finasteride? Is this just an age thing?\n\nCouple of other things: I regularly have morning wood, and I feel like the erection is really strong when I wake up, it fades after a bit though. During sex I feel like its constantly 80-90% hard and never really 100%. I've taken \"Viagra\" for fun and curiosity and the difference on the outside might not be much, but you can definitely feel that its completely solid on the inside. Also even today I constantly think about having sex all the time and considered myself really horny in spite of not getting random erections. Its weird because I feel like I can have a satisfactory sex life and do well and enjoy sex but I would like to be more \"solid\" overall if you catch my drift\n\nSo bottom line:\n\n1. Could these difficulties with erections be related to: finasteride, age, or just something mental like porn, I'm trying to not watch porn at all now?\n2. To those older than 25, do you find yourselves getting random erections? I legit think I get one random erection once a month or so (without stimuli).\n3. Are the chances I go back to \"normal\" high if I drop finasteride now after 4 years? For some reason I never really gave much thought about these erections, but I legit wish I could go back to a time when I was just \"harder\" more often, but I hear there are permanent side effects to some people.\n4. Any advice, opinion or anecdote is welcome.\n\nAlso I know I can't get a diagnose on an internet forum, I intend to see an urologist if this persists, I just want some advice.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"tressless","subreddit_id":"t5_2shlm","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/tressless","subreddit_subscribers":112513,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Another thread about erections and finasteride","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.33,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tressless\/comments\/rt6tfh\/another_thread_about_erections_and_finasteride\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

feel like I  need to tell this in order to start getting better I am 17 and a closeted Trans, and I realized a few months ago I am undeniably trans, Which was a lot harder for me than it should have.\n\nI guess I'll start with what I remember of before middle school because I can barely remember any of it. As a kid I remember we had these Disney princess dresses, I always loved wearing the Cinderella one from what I do remember the only reason I stopped wearing it was because we got rid of them. I also remember that when I was alone I would copy the posess that I saw girls doing and would get super self conscious about it and began thinking of myself as lesser for it, because everyone said I was a boy so I thought I  had to fit the part. Now I'm going to guess why I started repressing my feelings, I remember getting forcibly pinned against a tree by a group of girls and getting mocked for wearing a necklace, saying \"why are you wearing a necklace, necklaces are for girls and you're a boy\" and while I kept wearing necklaces it clearly traumatized me in some way for me too be able to remember it, because it got hurt all the time.\n\nNow the fun part, My decent into madness after my repressed emotions turn into a \"fettish\". I never thought I would actually talk about this but I realized if I don't I'll never get over it. In middle school like everyone else puberty started and the bad hormones took over, and I made a mistake. I remember that I got curious about Trans people based off of some random thing my older sister said, so I Googled \"boy to girl\" and what I saw when I went into images where these transformation sequences and stories that I was drawn to, the idea of turning into a girl was now a thing in my head but in the wrong way. The problem with these \"TG's\" is that they are overtly sexual and with the hormones in my system, of course I made a mistake. The addiction started just before I turned 12. \n\nI spent 4 years feeding the addiction not realizing why I was drawn to It, and why I wanted to be a girl. I also started having thought that weren't sexual, but I ignored them. I started having more and more of these thoughts and instead of trying to understand them I started calling myself a freek and a pervert. But I slowly started to realize especially when I got to high school. The void in me started to grow and I realized I couldn't continue to feed the addiction I had gained. \n\nI eventually met a Trans person my sophomore year and I started putting the pieces together. The only problem was I was too afraid to talk to anyone about it and figure it out. But then covid hit and I was left alone unable to communicate with most of my friends, so I started to self reflect and a part of me finally realized I was Trans. I was too afraid to admit it though so I decided I would try and quit my addiction and if the thoughts continued I would put effort into figuring myself out. While I did eventually relapse I saw I was right the thoughts continued without it. \n\nInstead of starting to accept myself though, I told myself I wasn't allowed to be happy until I got over the addiction.  This went on for well over a year until I discovered a web comic on DeviantArt called Body Suit 23 for whatever reason it spoke to me even though it wasn't outright Trans (at least not yet) it helped me to start actually making progress, while I didn't admit I was Trans, I started thinking about myself as gender fluid it helped  but not enough. Not too long after Marching Band started up and the new people that joined that year in my section finally got me to start admitting things. It started out with me admitting how much I loved dresses and eventually got to me trying to figure myself out, and they finally became the help I needed.\n\nSadly around that time the genetic depression I inherented from my dad started. I started to fall apart and It only got worse once school started, it felt like a part of me was dead. I also started getting proper dysphoria, looking at the hairs on my body wanting to cry, looking at my face and getting angry at it, and I started getting thoughts that I should just cut my privates off. I became Suicidal having thoughts of ending my life every single day, I eventually decided to get help. I convinced my mom to let me see a therapist and start anti-depressants the latter helping me get clean of my addiction for the longest period of time since I started trying to quit. I eventually came out to my therapist after a really bad dysphoric episode where I turned to the only thing that worked to make me feel better in the past, web comics, the web comic I read was called Rain I read the whole thing I two days using all the time I had avaliable. It made me finally put my foot and stop lying to myself.\n\nBut the voice in the back of my head that called me a freak persisted, coming back any time I wasn't having either gender dysphoria as a man or gender euphoria when I did things that were feminine. I eventually bought myself three dresses to help me experiment the first time I put one on I felt right. My dysphoria eventually made me want a bra so me and a friend from marching band literally just walked into a Walmart and get a pair of bra and panties. I have worn a bra everyday since. But when I put on the panties something horrible happened I went hard, and I got hit with a wave of self doubt  calling myself a freak and a perve. But for whatever reason I got over it I saw that it was just a leftover from my addiction and over time the issue went away.\n\nI was starting to feel comfortable about myself but then the beginning of this month I relapsed after I thought I had escaped it. I relapsed two more times, most of my progress went away while my dysphoria got worse. I have regained some of my progress and started doing things like shaving to help with my dysphoria. I started coming out to more of my friends I finally decided on a name and I decided to work on socially transitioning, or at least with my friends. I started looking into HRT and so far it looks like it's exactly what I need to start feeling better, The only problem Is that I need to come out to my parents for that to happen. My mom I know would be fine but I'm unsure about my dad, he falls asleep to fox news every single night, said homosexuals are mentally ill despite his brother being openly gay and happily married, and one time when I reminded my mom to not use my friends dead name he over heard and in an agitated voice shouted \"what\". To add to that my dad has always projected himself onto me and every time I do something  he doesn't like he takes it personally, so even if he isn't transphobic he might try to blame himself like everything else in my life. So I don't know what to do because each passing day I've gotten worse mentally and I'm pretty sure the only way I can get better is to start transitioning physically. So I've decided this new year I'll come out to them (probably after I turn 18 in May if I can make it that long) for better or for worse.\n\nThe only reason I felt comfortable posting this is because   I read this https:\/\/medium.com\/@kemenatan\/its-just-a-fetish-right-91cb0a4e261 \n\nI helped me realize I wasn't alone in having a nightmare \"fetish\" phase, I hate to admit it I used to think of myself as les Trans because of it but now after I read that and now tell my story hopefully I can get past it. And if you had the same problem hopefully me telling my story helped you, because no one should have to go through that.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MtF","subreddit_id":"t5_2ub9j","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/MtF","subreddit_subscribers":158209,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":0,"thumbnail_width":0,"title":"My story so far, I am probably going to miss a lot but I just need to get this off my chest","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.96,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MtF\/comments\/rt6vib\/my_story_so_far_i_am_probably_going_to_miss_a_lot\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}

I'm 26 and have been dealing with my weight my entire life. My family eats very poorly and it's been hard to motivate myself to lose weight. At the start of 2021, I decided to work hard on my diet and see how that impacts my weight. 2021 has been a very busy year for me. From the start of the year I was finishing my college education and enrolling in a post-graduate program while tutoring remotely from home. All my school and work were done from my computer due to the pandemic. As such, I got very little exercise and the fact that I live in a bad neighborhood, coupled with the pandemic, gave me little incentive to leave my house to attempt to get steps in or exercise. \n\nAt the start of the year I just began trying to eat healthy foods and look online for inspiration and ideas. I ordered a food scale and bathroom scale so that I could weigh my foods and myself. The first time I weighed myself this year I was 340.3 lbs. This morning I was 278.3lbs, exactly 62lbs lighter. It's been a journey. I've gone from barely fitting into a men's size 48 relaxed fit pants and now can barely keep up my men's size 44 relaxed fit pants, pretty soon I'm going to need size 42 relaxed fit. \n\nOne thing I'd like to mention, especially for those who just don't get out and exercise, like myself, is that I barely did any physical activity this year. I did buy a Cubii JR1 under-desk elliptical which I used consistently for maybe 5 months and then restarted using 2-3 weeks ago. This device helped a little, but I was only shooting for 200 cals when I did use it and I wasn't consistent after those first few initial months. For steps, I am lucky to get 6000 on an \"active day.\" \n\n**I'm not encouraging others to not be active**, but instead trying to point out that diet is the main culprit for weight loss and that exercise will simply help accelerate that process. If you're serious about losing weight you got to start in the kitchen. This year I've experimented with numerous variations on my deficit. I've had 3 weeks this year where I did no tracking, two of them were during the holidays and one was during finals week when I was stressing over graduation from my University. \n\nOne thing that's worked for me has been maintaining a larger deficit on the days where I'm not very active.  I've been on winter break from my post-graduate program for the last two weeks so I've been maintaining a 1000 calorie deficit during this time. Keep in mind, that a 1000 calorie deficit for me is 1675 cals, so this may not apply to you if that big a deficit leaves you with like 800 cals\/day. When school is in session, I'm out of the house all day (since September) and I adjusted my deficit to accommodate for more activity. \n\nI'm so happy that I've made so much progress, but I know I have a long ways to go. I just really wanted to share my experience as I reflect on the past year. I feel so much better and my overall outlook on life has changed for the better.

They are very very similar to the Empires in terms of width, length, etc., but obviously with Bont's carbon tub and forefoot design.\n\nAnyways, I got my cleats mounted up as best I could, and almost immediately I am having knee pain.  I have the cleats mounted in such a manner that they are as heel-in as they can go (as on my empires), but my foot feels like it wants to go even further (closer to the crank).  I had this problem with the Empires but I was able to get the cleat into a position that worked without knee pain after a little adjustment.  I cannot get the cleats further rotated on the bonts.\n\nI do have some cleat wedges that I've messed around with in the past, but gave up as I felt like I had more knee stability without them in the empires.  Are those worth a try with the Bonts to see if I can reduce the heel-in adjustment or at least add comfort?  I'm stumped as i can't adjust the cleats further in and feel like I shouldn't need an \"out-of-range\" adjustment to get comfortable.\n\nFor reference, I am 6' and 194lb, size 45 shoes.  High rigid arches.  I moved the insoles from the empires into the bonts.  I've never needed orthotics in the past, but I am considering getting some higher quality insoles, if I can get cleat adjustment sorted.\n\nedit: for any weirdos from the future who see this thread, it ended up being related to too much arch support from aftermarket insoles.

Apparently only one time to punish her for going out and before I was born. He abused me physically and emotionally. \n\nMy mother was suffering from being the victim of sexual abuse (as well as every other type of abuse) from my father. She also suffered from flashbacks and suicidal depression from being raped by her own father and about 6 other different men across her childhood and teen years (teachers, family friends etc.) \n\nI didn't my mother was being sexually abused at the time but I knew my father made me feel filthy and unclean and I hated when he grabbed me or hit me.\n\nFrom puberty at about age 10, I have suffered immensley with feeling unclean. I am 21 now and have spent every day of the last decade washing myself to try and make myself feel less disgusting.\n\nIt never felt like OCD... my father told me I had OCD and it was caused by genetics and I should get over it. However, it has always felt so much deeper, as if I am existentially broken and filthy.\n\nWhen I began masturbating at 10 due to having high sex drive it would always be by imagining being raped and never felt very nice but it felt necessary.\n\nI also have distressing vivid nightmares about being a little girl or an adult and being raped.\n\nAt one point I felt so disgusting that if I touched a book at school I would feel so sorry for anyone who had to touch the book after me as I thought my brokenness and filthiness would be passed on to them.\n\nSo, I'm not sure... does anyone know what this is called?\n\nIs it is like secondary sexual trauma maybe?\n\nI am sorry if I shouldn't post here due to not being a victim of csa.

Hadn't seen my extended family in a long time. I was able to wear a dress (that I hadn't worn in YEARS - tbh I didn't think I'd ever be able to wear it again). I got so many compliments that day.\n\nMy aunt - my mom's brother's wife (she's in her early 60s) noticed right away how much weight I lost. It was the first time someone has ever come to me for weight loss advice! She is significantly overweight and wanted to change her life. She said to me:\n\n\"What have you been doing? You look incredible. Also...there's something different about your face - it's glowing!\"\n\nMy soul delighted upon hearing that. I shared with her my experience, emphasizing that it really is about diet and finding a type of exercise that you really enjoy. For me, I began walking over the summer and I never looked back. I hated the gym, doing pilates, any other floor exercise because nothing stuck for me. I never entertained the idea of specific diets (such as keto, etc.) because in my opinion, they are not sustainable. I wanted to establish a lifestyle change.\n\nI started 2021 at just over 180 lbs (I'm 5'6F, 28 years old) and ended this year at 147 lbs (I went from clinically obese to a normal BMI). I couldn't be any prouder of myself. I never thought I'd be able to lose my weight. For some reason, it seemed like a far off dream. I knew though that I deserved to look and feel my best. I was tired of declining social invitations, clothes not fitting me (my mom's clothes didn't fit me either), dreading the stores and having to try on clothes because I knew nothing would fit, walking up the stairs and feeling short of breath, feeling unattractive, etc.\n\nAnd so...I got to work with these results to finish off this year! I'm still not at my goal weight yet. I'm aiming for 120 lbs (which hopefully I can accomplish in 2022). I've also been going to church a lot and focusing on my spirituality (to help with my self-esteem), thinking about hobbies I'd like to pursue this new year (I'll be tutoring for Kumon, and partaking in flower design - like making flower garlands\/bouquets\/flower crowns, etc. My dad's secretary does this for a hobby and is willing to teach me! I'm so excited!\n\nCareer is still being sorted out - but I know in due time I will have a job (a medical residency) at some stage in 2022. I finished medical school in 2019 and have been back home with my parents since. I've had great difficulty with my board licensing exams. This year I failed one of them and am studying to re-take it in Mid-January. Gonna make sure I kill it this time.\n\nOne of my best friends embarked on her self-love journey earlier on (you never really finish because it is for life). She told me that even people who were considered \"more successful\" - fancy titles, high-powered positions\/social status, affluent, etc. noticed the glow she exuded. They wanted to know what she was doing. Isn't that interesting?\n\nShe even said something that really resonated with me: That most people\/our society is very \"success\"-oriented. Placing our worth and value on those external measures of success - Awards\/accolades\/honor\/fame\/power\/prestige\/high degrees, etc. but not enough on growth\/personal development\/self-love. The latter three (and other areas in this particular realm) are what people neglect. Either because they are not self-aware or any other reason. This is why MOST people are\/remain dissatisfied with themselves\/their lives because they haven't looked inward. This is the true, deep and soulful work that enriches our lives and gives us meaning.\n\nA lady at my church's prayer team said that knowing God would have this effect on me - when I told her how nervous I was about society re-opening again after the pandemic in social gatherings. I felt ashamed of being single, still living with my parents, and unemployed. She said I will exude God's Light because I know Him which all of these other people (no matter how \"successful\" they are) could never have. \"They'll be scratching their heads wondering what's so different about you.\"\n\nOne of the biggest lessons I learned in 2021:\n\nSelf-love\/contentment\/fulfillment is INDEPENDENT of your employment\/relationship status (which society places so much emphasis on). It truly is an inside job and it's a daily work in progress. And remember, what really defines you? It's your heart and character. When you have true peace and contentment (no matter what stage you're in), NO ONE can take that away from you. I truly believe this peace comes from God above all else. Now that I'm rooting myself in Him, and holding on to God as my anchor...my life is transforming before my very own eyes.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Christianity","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh6c","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Christianity","subreddit_subscribers":322955,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"When you work on yourself, there's a certain glow about you.

Hadn't seen my extended family in a long time. I was able to wear a dress (that I hadn't worn in YEARS - tbh I didn't think I'd ever be able to wear it again). I got so many compliments that day.\n\nMy aunt - my mom's brother's wife (she's in her early 60s) noticed right away how much weight I lost. It was the first time someone has ever come to me for weight loss advice! She is significantly overweight and wanted to change her life. She said to me:\n\n\"What have you been doing? You look incredible. Also...there's something different about your face - it's glowing!\"\n\nMy soul delighted upon hearing that. I shared with her my experience, emphasizing that it really is about diet and finding a type of exercise that you really enjoy. For me, I began walking over the summer and I never looked back. I hated the gym, doing pilates, any other floor exercise because nothing stuck for me. I never entertained the idea of specific diets (such as keto, etc.) because in my opinion, they are not sustainable. I wanted to establish a lifestyle change.\n\nI started 2021 at just over 180 lbs (I'm 5'6F, 28 years old) and ended this year at 147 lbs (I went from clinically obese to a normal BMI). I couldn't be any prouder of myself. I never thought I'd be able to lose my weight. For some reason, it seemed like a far off dream. I knew though that I deserved to look and feel my best. I was tired of declining social invitations, clothes not fitting me (my mom's clothes didn't fit me either), dreading the stores and having to try on clothes because I knew nothing would fit, walking up the stairs and feeling short of breath, feeling unattractive, etc.\n\nAnd so...I got to work with these results to finish off this year! I'm still not at my goal weight yet. I'm aiming for 120 lbs (which hopefully I can accomplish in 2022). I've also been going to church a lot and focusing on my spirituality (to help with my self-esteem), thinking about hobbies I'd like to pursue this new year (I'll be tutoring for Kumon, and partaking in flower design - like making flower garlands\/bouquets\/flower crowns, etc. My dad's secretary does this for a hobby and is willing to teach me! I'm so excited!\n\nCareer is still being sorted out - but I know in due time I will have a job (a medical residency) at some stage in 2022. I finished medical school in 2019 and have been back home with my parents since. I've had great difficulty with my board licensing exams. This year I failed one of them and am studying to re-take it in Mid-January. Gonna make sure I kill it this time.\n\nOne of my best friends embarked on her self-love journey earlier on (you never really finish because it is for life). She told me that even people who were considered \"more successful\" - fancy titles, high-powered positions\/social status, affluent, etc. noticed the glow she exuded. They wanted to know what she was doing. Isn't that interesting?\n\nShe even said something that really resonated with me: That most people\/our society is very \"success\"-oriented. Placing our worth and value on those external measures of success - Awards\/accolades\/honor\/fame\/power\/prestige\/high degrees, etc. but not enough on growth\/personal development\/self-love. The latter three (and other areas in this particular realm) are what people neglect. Either because they are not self-aware or any other reason. This is why MOST people are\/remain dissatisfied with themselves\/their lives because they haven't looked inward. This is the true, deep and soulful work that enriches our lives and gives us meaning.\n\nA lady at my church's prayer team said that knowing God would have this effect on me - when I told her how nervous I was about society re-opening again after the pandemic in social gatherings. I felt ashamed of being single, still living with my parents, and unemployed. She said I will exude God's Light because I know Him which all of these other people (no matter how \"successful\" they are) could never have. \"They'll be scratching their heads wondering what's so different about you.\"\n\nOne of the biggest lessons I learned in 2021:\n\nSelf-love\/contentment\/fulfillment is INDEPENDENT of your employment\/relationship status (which society places so much emphasis on). It truly is an inside job and it's a daily work in progress. And remember, what really defines you? It's your heart and character. When you have true peace and contentment (no matter what stage you're in), NO ONE can take that away from you. I truly believe this peace comes from God above all else. Now that I'm rooting myself in Him, and holding on to God as my anchor...my life is transforming before my very own eyes.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TrueChristian","subreddit_id":"t5_2u489","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TrueChristian","subreddit_subscribers":74812,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"When you work on yourself, there's a certain glow about you.

I'm 30 years old and I have always longed for a meaningful, fulfilling life. \n\nIt's new years and I feel as though my problem with alcohol has held me back from so many years of love, laughing, caring, and even more so, a social well-being. I know this may sound controversial to popular belief, but what is considered the social drug (alcohol) has detained me from experiencing my life the way I originally intended to as a youngster growing up. \n\nIt's not that I dont believe I can get sober and crawl my way back into happiness. It's that I'm bored and cannot retain a strong frame to carry on without alcohol. As many others may agree to, being drunk kind of brings out my vibrant nature. It assesses my feelings and actuates them, which is something I am not good at while sober. \n\nI'm sorry for the long rant, but I only hope to find a community who understands addiction and also to suggest some sort of u-turn that makes sense.

The 4 month old piercing has been severely irritated for about 2 months now, and I'm running out of patience and trying to find a solution. I'm thinking maybe the older piercing's earring might be irritating the area - it's an 18k gold butterfly back stud that touches the irritated spot.\n\nMy main concern is that the old piercing will try to close, because the area surrounding it is irritated and trying to heal. Do I need to be concerned about it, or might it be helpful to not have that second earring so close by?\n\nI've tried everything, including going to a dermatologist - she said it might be a keloid, but it is definitely not a keloid because of how it shrinks and grows and because of the fact it looks like a massive cystic pimple. If it's not an irritation bump it may be a cyst, which would explain why nothing I'm doing is working. She gave me an antibiotic ointment that worked originally, then I stopped using it after the course of treatment, and it came back. I started using it again, alongside a saline spray - I clean the area with saline and get the old ointment off, then apply new ointment, three times a day as per the ointment's instructions.\n\nI've been over possible metal allergies - I have a Neometal titanium stud in there now, and I even tried the gold stud (which I had for 10 years in my old piercings prior to getting a new set of titanium jewelry), which ended up being too short. I've never had a problem with either gold or titanium in my other two piercings, so I don't think that would be my issue.\n\nI'm hoping continuing to wash it with saline and using the antibiotics will help. As soon as I'm able I'm going to try to see the piercer, but they won't see me without my parents until I'm 18 and I'm 17 for a few more weeks.\n\nBut anyway, that was way more information than needed for my original question. Would taking the old piercing out for now be problematic? Or is it worth a shot?\n\nEdit: figured I'd go ahead and add the pics in here too. https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/4dQIJDZ","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PiercingAdvice","subreddit_id":"t5_2rtn8","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/PiercingAdvice","subreddit_subscribers":45596,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Is it okay to take out an older, healed piercing (10+ years) to let a newer nearby piercing heal?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PiercingAdvice\/comments\/rt7so2\/is_it_okay_to_take_out_an_older_healed_piercing\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Hadn't seen my extended family in a long time. I was able to wear a dress (that I hadn't worn in YEARS - tbh I didn't think I'd ever be able to wear it again). I got so many compliments that day.\n\nMy aunt - my mom's brother's wife (she's in her early 60s) noticed right away how much weight I lost. It was the first time someone has ever come to me for weight loss advice! She is significantly overweight and wanted to change her life. She said to me:\n\n\"What have you been doing? You look incredible. Also...there's something different about your face - it's glowing!\"\n\nMy soul delighted upon hearing that. I shared with her my experience, emphasizing that it really is about diet and finding a type of exercise that you really enjoy. For me, I began walking over the summer and I never looked back. I hated the gym, doing pilates, any other floor exercise because nothing stuck for me. I never entertained the idea of specific diets (such as keto, etc.) because in my opinion, they are not sustainable. I wanted to establish a lifestyle change.\n\nI started 2021 at just over 180 lbs (I'm 5'6F, 28 years old) and ended this year at 147 lbs (I went from clinically obese to a normal BMI). I couldn't be any prouder of myself. I never thought I'd be able to lose my weight. For some reason, it seemed like a far off dream. I knew though that I deserved to look and feel my best. I was tired of declining social invitations, clothes not fitting me (my mom's clothes didn't fit me either), dreading the stores and having to try on clothes because I knew nothing would fit, walking up the stairs and feeling short of breath, feeling unattractive, etc.\n\nAnd so...I got to work with these results to finish off this year! I'm still not at my goal weight yet. I'm aiming for 120 lbs (which hopefully I can accomplish in 2022). I've also been going to church a lot and focusing on my spirituality (to help with my self-esteem), thinking about hobbies I'd like to pursue this new year (I'll be tutoring for Kumon, and partaking in flower design - like making flower garlands\/bouquets\/flower crowns, etc. My dad's secretary does this for a hobby and is willing to teach me! I'm so excited!\n\nCareer is still being sorted out - but I know in due time I will have a job (a medical residency) at some stage in 2022. I finished medical school in 2019 and have been back home with my parents since. I've had great difficulty with my board licensing exams. This year I failed one of them and am studying to re-take it in Mid-January. Gonna make sure I kill it this time.\n\nOne of my best friends embarked on her self-love journey earlier on (you never really finish because it is for life). She told me that even people who were considered \"more successful\" - fancy titles, high-powered positions\/social status, affluent, etc. noticed the glow she exuded. They wanted to know what she was doing. Isn't that interesting?\n\nShe even said something that really resonated with me: That most people\/our society is very \"success\"-oriented. Placing our worth and value on those external measures of success - Awards\/accolades\/honor\/fame\/power\/prestige\/high degrees, etc. but not enough on growth\/personal development\/self-love. The latter three (and other areas in this particular realm) are what people neglect. Either because they are not self-aware or any other reason. This is why MOST people are\/remain dissatisfied with themselves\/their lives because they haven't looked inward. This is the true, deep and soulful work that enriches our lives and gives us meaning.\n\nA lady at my church's prayer team said that knowing God would have this effect on me - when I told her how nervous I was about society re-opening again after the pandemic in social gatherings. I felt ashamed of being single, still living with my parents, and unemployed. She said I will exude God's Light because I know Him which all of these other people (no matter how \"successful\" they are) could never have. \"They'll be scratching their heads wondering what's so different about you.\"\n\nOne of the biggest lessons I learned in 2021:\n\nSelf-love\/contentment\/fulfillment is INDEPENDENT of your employment\/relationship status (which society places so much emphasis on). It truly is an inside job and it's a daily work in progress. And remember, what really defines you? It's your heart and character. When you have true peace and contentment (no matter what stage you're in), NO ONE can take that away from you. I truly believe this peace comes from God above all else. Now that I'm rooting myself in Him, and holding on to God as my anchor...my life is transforming before my very own eyes.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ChristianDating","subreddit_id":"t5_2tqrp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ChristianDating","subreddit_subscribers":3602,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"When you work on yourself, there's a certain glow about you.

everyone. I posted 283 days ago about earning my high school diploma at 36 after being on my own since 16 and dealing with homelessness. I just wanted to update everyone since it was New Years Eve and so many amazing people commented. I did in fact get my high school diploma in June of this year. In August I started my first year of college and my first semester grades came in and I finished with a 3.833 GPA. I am getting my major in Social Work to help abused and neglected children. I don’t have friends or family so I wanted to share it here. For the first time in my life I have completed my goals for the year and I am actually proud of myself. I want to encourage everyone to always follow your dreams. Don’t ever let anyone tell you that you are too old to accomplish your dreams or aspirations. I never thought I would be a high school graduate, let alone going through college. If you are an adult and are without your diploma please reach out to me. I would love to help you find the resources so you can earn yours too. I went 20 years without it and I thought it would be impossible, but I did it. You can do it, it doesn’t cost anything but time. There are also programs, like certain financial aid that is a grant for us older folks that will help you go to either college or help you learn a trade after you get your diploma. Again reach out to me and I would love to help you. \n\nI also want to thank each and every one of you that sent me a message or commented on my post. You all helped me stay focused and motivated. Every time I felt discouraged I would read through the kind words and I knew I had to keep going. You all helped me earn my diploma and I could never say thank you enough.\n\nEDIT: I am just overwhelmed by all of your responses. All of your words of encouragement and everyone who have shared their story is amazing. I am so sorry to the ones I haven’t responded to yet, I will get to you. Also, just wanted to let everyone know I am a chick. No one offended me I just wanted to let everyone know. You all are rockstars and are an inspiration to me! All of your words will help me going throughout the year. I am thinking of printing them off and making a collage to put next to my desk.

I'm 15 - But yet have had a paracosm going on since I was 8 and thought I'd share the epilogue of the story I'm working on based off of it! I'm around 30 pages in and so far the people I've shown it to like it! [Heres the google doc link to said story.](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1HO79zQWbnTdqfpew7JDkh4hJjg8z8nO40b9QYl5sACU\/edit?usp=drivesdk)\n\nI call it \"Etherum: A War of Order and Mayhem\". I know it probably sounds cringy, I just don't know a better name.\n\n*\"Long before Etherum existed, long before any of the 3 layers existed... There was only balance and chaos. Legend tells that these creatures felt isolated, wanted power, something to control. They combined for the one and only time, and created the 3 layers, also known as the Etherum.*\n\n*The above is known as Statera, the only layer known to mankind. This layer is filled with light, and various creatures. It is watched by Luxor, the being of light and balance. Many tales tell of various creatures seeing it in numerous forms, the most common sighting being a white feathered amphithere with a pale, creamy mane the color of dawn.*\n\n*It has been said to live in the sky above Exitium, an archipelago 500 miles southwest of Azera, the mainland where most of mankind resides. Beyond any of these islands and continents, there is an ocean. This planet is known as \"Earth\", with many other planets and stars also populating this space. \nThe middle is known as Munterdos, a void where the spirits of the dead reside. Occasionally, they may seep into Statera or Umbarus, causing the sightings that many know as 'ghosts'. There are only a few celestial bodies floating about, with a large plane in the middle. It is also known as a bridge between dimensions, with most deities passing within here to either side.*\n\n*There is a great and endless plane that acts as a floor here, with light on one end and dark on the other. The sky is a dark, purplish hue in here. Many say that sometimes by mirrors, you can hear these spirits screaming or chuckling. No mortal has been known to ever manage to pass through here, instead getting caught within the void, or if they have, they’ve never returned.*\n\n*The below is known as Umbarus, and is like a sort of hell, except not what many think. Many legends speak of those who are evil and unbalanced ending up here instead of within Munterdos. Umbarus is ruled by Tenebris, the being of chaos and darkness. There is no light here, beyond glowing crystals and red-hot streams. These red and black swirls of thick, goopy fluid are not lava, but in fact a substance known as “Malium\". If a Staterian being touches this liquid, they become 'corrupted’, lashing out at everything around them.*\n\n*Both light and dark wish to overtake one another, but darkness is far more hostile and must be contained, lest it spread and block out life itself. If the balance is tipped, a great catastrophe shall follow, and with this calamity, all shall perish into nothing, breaking the cycle and erasing time itself.\"*\n\nSo, what do you guys think?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"paracosms","subreddit_id":"t5_2xnul","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/paracosms","subreddit_subscribers":929,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[OC] I've been looking for a place to share my fantasy paracosm for years now!

Graduated hs early, depression hit and I put college off for a couple years, ended up doing a few semesters at community College and dropped classes with a 4.0 GPA.\n\nLife circumstances changed, I went from bartending at my family's restaurant making pretty good money, like 1k per week checks and cash tips too, all under the table. I felt like I had good money, was able to pay rent and all that good stuff.\n\nNow I'm going to go 15k into fasfa debt to work on wind turbines, and will at best get 25 an hour after a 6 month training school, and will pretty much have a guaranteed job in the industry upon completion.\n\nI feel like I was making more than 25 at bartending, some nights at a sports bar I would leave with 5-700 bucks for one night. It was insane. But it wasn't sustainable, I ended up drinking myself into a coma after I cut my hand open with a .3x bac.\n\nI will most likely get a per diem of 100ish a day, 25 an hour, possibly 20 hours of overtime, this is all best case scenario. The benefit is I will be working in an industry I truly am passionate about-the atheists motto is leave the planet in better shape than you found-and renewables will fill a void inside me.\n\nBut I am concerned, is 25 an hour even livable in today's standards? Especially for potentially dangerous, high voltage, hard, long work. And taking loans out as icing on the cake. \n\nThanks for reading, just looking for perspective, as I'm already committed to this.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_subscribers":1964415,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Is 25 an hour good enough to live?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.87,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/rt8i72\/is_25_an_hour_good_enough_to_live\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

It will be helpful for me in terms of motivation, and I hope it will be helpful for other beginners to see what methods were effective for me, and what mistakes I make along the way.  am not using the Refold method, but I will be primarily using Comprehensible Input. \n\nI have a little bit of experience with language learning - I have studied Russian for a cumulative 6 years through high school and college. In spite of all this time spent studying, I only had one conversation with a stranger in Russian. Needless to say, I cannot speak Russian (this is my White Whale - after learning Spanish to an advanced level, I would like to return to Russian with what I know now about language acquisition). \n\nMy main language learning experience comes from when I lived in Albania as an English teacher. I lived with a host family for a bit, took classes and used Albanian everyday for survival and basic needs. By the end of 2 years, I was extremely conversational and could speak with just about anyone on public transit about random topics. Depending on regional dialect and other factors, sometimes I would have a very hard time, but I could always meander my way through a conversation and find common ground to talk about. Since leaving Albania, I have gotten quite rusty, but nevertheless this is where I finally felt like I \"unlocked\" the secrets of language learning. I apologize for the self-indulgent tangent, but I just wanted to provide some context about my experiences with languages. I will be applying a lot of the methods I learned during this time to my Spanish adventure. \n\nHere are my methods in the short time I've been studying, and also some of the outcomes I've seen. \n\n**Listening:**\n\nSince my first day on September 27, 2021, I have listened to about 100 hours of Spanish comprehensible input at this point. I track the time of every video or podcast I listen to, rounding down to the nearest minute. For the first 50 hours or so, it was almost 100% Dreaming Spanish content. I want to focus on LatAm Spanish, but the amount of content that Pablo creates at beginner and SuperBeginner level is just INSANE. So incredibly helpful. After that, I was able to listen to some simpler podcasts like Españolistos (basically my bread and butter currently), and News in Slow Spanish. I honestly cannot stand the host's voice in News, but I listen anyway for the input lol. \n\nRecently, I have also discovered the world of Spanish-speaking travel Vloggers on YouTube. They speak at a much more colloquial and advanced level, and it is not material intended for learners. However, in their videos it is very easy to pick up context due to their gestures, faces, and places they film. The two I have enjoyed the most are a Mexican guy called LuisitoComunica (very charismatic goofball, uses slang like crazy, eats great street food), and a channel called PlanetaJuan (a Columbian guy who speaks in a very cool, calm, and collected way, with very high quality videography and narration). Even though these channels are a bit above my level of understanding, I find them very engaging and fun so I keep watching. \n\nCurrently, I get about 2 hours daily of listening input from a combo of active listening (YouTube vids) and passive (podcasts while doing chores). I make sure to listen to a decent amount of content where I can understand about 90%, which is usually Dreaming Spanish vids. I also spend a good amount of time listening to more advanced contect, such as the Vloggers. I am lost sometimes, but I am absorbing a lot of the prosody and rhythm of the language this way. \n\n**Reading:**\n\nI fuckin love reading. I honestly don't know how I should measure my reading input, but I definitely do it every day. I have listened to 100 hours, but I've read at LEAST as much as that. I started with Paco Ardit's grader readers. I'm not sure exactly how many I read, but I bought a pack of A1 level and A2 level readers that totalled about 8-10 \"books.\" They were so short and simple that I don't know of you can call them books. I would recommend anyone who is starting a new language to do this! It takes the frustration of not understanding vocabulary and grammar, and gives you a triumphant feeling of finishing something at your level. The writing is, frankly, not very good, and sometimes cringey. One story is about a college student falling in love with and dating her professor, for example. \n\nI finished the A2 reader pack, and I moved on to reading an actual novel - *Harry Potter y la Piedra Filosofal.* Only just started, but loving it so far. Reading a story that you are very familiar with is so so helpful for context. \n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\nI use the GoldList method. It's a very good compromise for me, since I love the concept of SRS but hate the slog of Anki. I love making lists and it's a sort of analog \"hack\" for SRS vocab study. Also it feels very relaxing to just sip a cup of coffee and do my vocab lists. I am currently getting my vocab from a frequency dictionary, but I am finding that reading is a much more efficient way of reinforcing those common words. \n\n**Speaking &amp; Writing:**\n\nNone yet. I am 3 months in and focusing very heavily on input. Pablo fr Dreaming Spanish seems to think I should have hundreds of hours of input before I start speaking, but my experience with Albanian tells me that it's better to start early. So I am going to start doing iTalki conversational sessions next week! \n\nAnyway, that's it! I am 3 months in and I am very happy with my progress in comprehension. I know this feeling of rapid progress will soon fade away as I approach the intermediate plateau. If you found this post helpful, great. If it was too long and you didn't read, that's cool too. If any other beginners want to bounce ideas off of one another, I am very open to that. I am also very open to advice. Hopefully I'll remember to post updates about progress every hundred-or-so hours.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"languagelearning","subreddit_id":"t5_2rjsc","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/languagelearning","subreddit_subscribers":485743,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"100 hours of Spanish input","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.9,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/languagelearning\/comments\/rt8s7w\/100_hours_of_spanish_input\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}
