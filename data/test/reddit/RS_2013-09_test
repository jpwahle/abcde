{"title":"Just graduated with enormous student debt, lucky to be entering a high paying job - how much of my excess income should I dedicate to student debt, versus buying an apartment or saving?","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","author":"Lomlhandra","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ljmls/just_graduated_with_enormous_student_debt_lucky/","stickied":false,"subreddit":"personalfinance","banned_by":null,"author_flair_text":null,"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"media":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":29,"created_utc":1378079254,"selftext":"I'm 28, and I just graduated from law school - I'm paying for both undergrad and law school by myself and I'd appreciate some advice on how to responsibly manage my massive debt while saving for an emergency, a house, and the future. \n\nMy student debt stands at a devastating $299,070. The highest interest rates are 7.9%, and the lowest are 2.5%. The blended interest rate is 5.7%. I also have around $18,000 credit card debt at around 16% APR. I know, fuck.\n\nThe good news is that next month I'll start a relatively high income job. I start work at a New York City law firm and I'll make $170,000 annually after bonus.  I'll take home about $108,000 after taxes.  That's $9,000/month take home pay after taxes. \n\nI support my significant other. My monthly expenses total $7580. That's $3300 minimum payment on all the loans, $2200 rent and utilities, $300 cabs and subway, $700 food, $500 misc, $460 insurance, $120 dogs. \n\nThat leaves me with $1420 income left over each month during my first year to allocate to paying down loans or savings. In the coming years, I'll have more to put towards either loans or savings/house goals. The typical \"big law\" pay scale increase is as follows before bonus: \nyr 2 - base pay 170,000\nyr 3- 185,000\nyr 4 - 210,000\nyr 5 - 230,000\netc. \n\nAs soon as I start work, I'm going to pay off the credit card debt as fast as possible and never ever carry a balance again.  That leaves around ~$300,000 in student debt to whittle down, at a blended interest rate of 5.7%. \n\nSo, reddit, how much of my extra ~$1500+/month should I put towards those massive student loans at an average of 5.7% interest versus contributing to my firm's IRA and/or saving for a house? \n\nSince I'm going to be in a higher income tax bracket, I'd like to reduce my taxes by taking the mortgage deduction, and by saving for retirement through an IRA. \n\nEventually, I would like to buy a $300,000 apartment in New York City, because I don't want to throwing away ~$25,000 a year on rent, but that would require a down payment of $60,000. It would take me about 2.5 years to save that much if I put my excess income in a CD or savings account instead of debt. If I got a house, I could get a mortgage that is the same as my $2200/month, so after three years I'd be building equity and I could again start putting all of my excess income towards loans. \n\nI've read the post on home-buying suggested in the FAQ, but I'm interested in your thoughts on how the calculus changes when you've got massive student debt. Should I just throw everything at my loans until they are paid down? Or should I treat this as long term debt and save for a house simultaneously? I appreciate any advice. Thanks!\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone - didn't expect to get this many responses. I appreciate it! A couple things: \n\n1) I'm really interested if anyone has any insight on the tax implications of buying a house versus owning, when I'm in the 28% tax bracket. It's important to note that in order to save for a down payment, I'd be NOT spending around $2000 of excess income each month on student loans, but after saving for the down payment after 2 or 3 years, my mortgage and condo fees would be the same as my current rent. So what we're really talking about is the cost, over three years and after taxes, of not paying down my loans as fast as possible. After three years, when I'm in the home, I'd take the deductions for home ownership, and then I'd dedicate all excess income to the loans as fast as possible. \n\n2) People were concerned about me supporting my significant other, I should clarify that that won't be forever. He made big sacrifices working a job he didn't like while I was in school to help get me to where I am, so I'm supporting him for a year or two while he gets his dream start-up off the ground - the startup is making some money in the first year and he does have some income from that, but it's not very predictable. He's fundraising now and will leave this if it doesn't work out in the near future. I truly believe in him and his ability to be successful and be his own boss, but he also has good regular job prospects if it doesn't work out. We've been together 7 years and plan on getting married in the future, but we're waiting until I can get my loans paid down because that shit's expensive, and we want a nice wedding and are willing to wait till we can afford it. \n\n3) Here is the loan breakdown, by interest rate:\n7.9% - $111,242;  \n7.75% - $37,784;  \n6.8% - $89,854;  \n5.25% - $49,030;  \n2.5% - $11,260.\n\n4) I'm not completely unconcerned with job security, but I am entering one of the very best firms in New york, and the firm is in a very good financial position. From what I hear from older associates, people just don't get fired and put out on the street. They may get suggestions or a talking to that they are not going to make partner and it's better to seek work elsewhere, but they are given time to find another job and leave at their leisure. Being out on the streets is not a real threat. People with my foreign language skill set have lots of exit opportunities at other high paying jobs - recruiters call constantly. \n\n5) I feel like I'm pretty frugal for living in New York City. I only buy my food at costco, have a chest freezer, and actually do cook at home on the once a month cooking plan. My health insurance is high because that's what it costs in NY. I have a misc category because at least during the first year I need to buy some decent clothing for work - it's a very conservative office. There are definitely places in NYC at 600 or 700 square feet for $300,000k, within 15 min of my office. However, I do appreciate the thoughts about reducing the budget. I looked over the numbers again with my S.O. this morning and we think we can get my excess income number closer to $2000 per month, or $2500, which will be the goal. \n\n","is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","edited":1378143009,"distinguished":null,"report_reasons":null,"downs":0,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 28, and I just graduated from law school - I&amp;#39;m paying for both undergrad and law school by myself and I&amp;#39;d appreciate some advice on how to responsibly manage my massive debt while saving for an emergency, a house, and the future. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My student debt stands at a devastating $299,070.

That leaves around ~$300,000 in student debt to whittle down, at a blended interest rate of 5.7%. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, reddit, how much of my extra ~$1500+/month should I put towards those massive student loans at an average of 5.7% interest versus contributing to my firm&amp;#39;s IRA and/or saving for a house? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;#39;m going to be in a higher income tax bracket, I&amp;#39;d like to reduce my taxes by taking the mortgage deduction, and by saving for retirement through an IRA. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I would like to buy a $300,000 apartment in New York City, because I don&amp;#39;t want to throwing away ~$25,000 a year on rent, but that would require a down payment of $60,000. It would take me about 2.5 years to save that much if I put my excess income in a CD or savings account instead of debt. If I got a house, I could get a mortgage that is the same as my $2200/month, so after three years I&amp;#39;d be building equity and I could again start putting all of my excess income towards loans. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read the post on home-buying suggested in the FAQ, but I&amp;#39;m interested in your thoughts on how the calculus changes when you&amp;#39;ve got massive student debt. Should I just throw everything at my loans until they are paid down? Or should I treat this as long term debt and save for a house simultaneously? I appreciate any advice. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thanks everyone - didn&amp;#39;t expect to get this many responses. I appreciate it! A couple things: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) I&amp;#39;m really interested if anyone has any insight on the tax implications of buying a house versus owning, when I&amp;#39;m in the 28% tax bracket. It&amp;#39;s important to note that in order to save for a down payment, I&amp;#39;d be NOT spending around $2000 of excess income each month on student loans, but after saving for the down payment after 2 or 3 years, my mortgage and condo fees would be the same as my current rent. So what we&amp;#39;re really talking about is the cost, over three years and after taxes, of not paying down my loans as fast as possible. After three years, when I&amp;#39;m in the home, I&amp;#39;d take the deductions for home ownership, and then I&amp;#39;d dedicate all excess income to the loans as fast as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) People were concerned about me supporting my significant other, I should clarify that that won&amp;#39;t be forever. He made big sacrifices working a job he didn&amp;#39;t like while I was in school to help get me to where I am, so I&amp;#39;m supporting him for a year or two while he gets his dream start-up off the ground - the startup is making some money in the first year and he does have some income from that, but it&amp;#39;s not very predictable. He&amp;#39;s fundraising now and will leave this if it doesn&amp;#39;t work out in the near future. I truly believe in him and his ability to be successful and be his own boss, but he also has good regular job prospects if it doesn&amp;#39;t work out. We&amp;#39;ve been together 7 years and plan on getting married in the future, but we&amp;#39;re waiting until I can get my loans paid down because that shit&amp;#39;s expensive, and we want a nice wedding and are willing to wait till we can afford it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Here is the loan breakdown, by interest rate:\n7.9% - $111,242;&lt;br/&gt;\n7.75% - $37,784;&lt;br/&gt;\n6.8% - $89,854;&lt;br/&gt;\n5.25% - $49,030;&lt;br/&gt;\n2.5% - $11,260.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) I&amp;#39;m not completely unconcerned with job security, but I am entering one of the very best firms in New york, and the firm is in a very good financial position. From what I hear from older associates, people just don&amp;#39;t get fired and put out on the street. They may get suggestions or a talking to that they are not going to make partner and it&amp;#39;s better to seek work elsewhere, but they are given time to find another job and leave at their leisure. Being out on the streets is not a real threat. People with my foreign language skill set have lots of exit opportunities at other high paying jobs - recruiters call constantly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) I feel like I&amp;#39;m pretty frugal for living in New York City. I only buy my food at costco, have a chest freezer, and actually do cook at home on the once a month cooking plan. My health insurance is high because that&amp;#39;s what it costs in NY. I have a misc category because at least during the first year I need to buy some decent clothing for work - it&amp;#39;s a very conservative office. There are definitely places in NYC at 600 or 700 square feet for $300,000k, within 15 min of my office. However, I do appreciate the thoughts about reducing the budget. I looked over the numbers again with my S.O. this morning and we think we can get my excess income number closer to $2000 per month, or $2500, which will be the goal. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","mod_reports":[],"retrieved_on":1411870526,"domain":"self.personalfinance","permalink":"/r/personalfinance/comments/1ljmls/just_graduated_with_enormous_student_debt_lucky/","score":29,"media_embed":{},"gilded":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"over_18":false,"num_comments":62,"id":"1ljmls","user_reports":[]}

If you can draw value from it, all the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When my new psychologist diagnosed me with PTSD at the age of 27, I at first thought I was wasting my money going to therapy again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after doing my own research I realized that some of my negative personality traits were actually symptoms of PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This knowledge has allowed me to understand myself better and I have grown tremendously in the three years since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I now feel ready to tackle bigger challenges in my personal growth, and one of those challenges is daring to put myself out there, to share my energy with the world -- and I&amp;#39;m starting with you guys :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking out brings success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only when people know about you and your message can they direct their attention towards you. And where attention goes, energy flows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if I want to be successful, I must face my fear of &amp;quot;going public&amp;quot; -- to allow myself to express openly to strangers what I feel inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This, I believe, is my last step in overcoming PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot exactly explain what the fear is, but it feels connected to a fear from my teenage years: No one can know too much about me and my whereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From a young age I was disaster planning -- my father started drinking when I was five years old and I never knew what to expect what when I got home from school. But looking back now I think the PTSD broke out around my 13th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make a long story short, we fled from my father, moved to a different city and started a new life in secrecy, unlisted in phone or address registers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At my new school nobody had any clue about my background. And at work, my mom used her middle name so my father would not find her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We settled into the daily grind and everything was once again peaceful in the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But inside, my mind had switched into a turbocharged alert mode -- my father could find us any day now and I started planning escape routes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you opened the door to our new apartment, it would fully cover the door to my room. So anyone entering the apartment for the first time would not notice that there was a room behind the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This meant that if my father found us and broke in again, he would in his rage not be aware of me hiding in my room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could then lock the door (always had the key ready), open the window and descend the drainage pipe from our 3rd floor apartment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there I could run to get help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I imagined and thought out solutions to these kinds of scenarios all the time for various locations I would be in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The worst was when I visited my best friend in the city we had moved away from -- the city where my father lived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though my friend lived in a quiet neighborhood in the opposite end of the city from my father, I was scared shitless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first I would not leave my friend&amp;#39;s house at all. My mom and her new boyfriend dropped me off and picked me up without us entering the city. I liked it that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As my friend and I grew into teenagers, we started hanging out in a big group with other friends. It was nice, but it also meant teenage activities that put my constant state of alertness into overdrive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even as I sit here writing this a decade and a half later, a vivid image of a threatening situation comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems so silly now, but back then it was very real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was crossing the street into the main square of my father&amp;#39;s town, a large open space. It was scary as hell. I looked over my shoulders, scanning every person in sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only when I concluded that none of them were &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; could I calm down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a recurring pattern in my life at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anytime I was exposed out in the open my mind would be running at DEFCON 1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if I was inside in a place with a lot people, I would sit with my back to a wall where I had overview of what was going on in the whole area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My filter was first and foremost directed at my father, but I eventually became very good at sensing any kind of threatening situation -- but most of the time the threats were only in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I firmly believe that the world is what we make of it; and the worst case mentality I carried around until my mid twenties was destructive to me and my loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I grew older and stronger, I also grew angrier. I started attracting violence and sometimes provoked it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily I was hanging out with good natured people and this side of me only showed itself in extreme situations, such as when I had too much to drink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One time at a party I briefly considered punching a girl in the face. Instead I punched myself in the face so hard I knocked out the corner of a tooth and fell over -- I still have that rough edge on my tooth to remind me what I used to be like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This happened when I was 21. But throughout my teenage years I had mental breakdowns every six months or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pivotal point for me came in 2005 when I at the age of 22 discovered MDMA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first it was just a fun party drug I did with friends. But eventually I had deep bonding experiences with people close to me -- especially my brother.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking back, giving MDMA to a 17-year-old is not the most responsible thing in the world.

{"selftext":"Wall of text disclaimer.  Also, might be a little mixed up, I'm not in a great place mentally right now.\n\nI am 21 years old.  Twenty one.  My mother has singlehandedly demolished any chance of a real life from the inside out.  Growing up, all my sisters and I have ever heard from her is \"You're not good enough because...\"  She's currently 50 and regularly screams at myself, my 15 year old sister, and my 7 year old sister, for not being able to see things with the perspective of someone who's been alive for half a century.  This morning, I woke up sick.  I came upstairs (in my parents' house where I live, because I pay my tuition myself out of pocket, and I pay rent to them on top of it, and I don't end up with enough left over to save to move out), and I said \"I don't feel well.\"  My mother sneered at me and said \"NOW what the fuck is wrong with you?!\"  Well, honestly, mother, what is wrong with me is that an invisible germ has found its way into my immune system and it's making my head, throat, and nose hurt, and I'm more tired than usual.  It is, despite what she believes, not in any possible conceivable way, my fault, especially since the only time I've left the house in over a month is to pick my youngest sister up from school.  With her.  Because I can't drive.  Because at 21, I am not allowed out of the house without her, and she keeps \"forgetting\" to take me to the DMV.  For the past 5 years.  \n\nI am seriously becoming suicidal.  All I ever want to do anymore is sleep.  I have no energy, no desire to do anything, and I am a nervous wreck.  I cry all the time, at everything.  My middle sister, it seemed, recently broke her leg falling out of a tree in the back yard.  When she and my parents got home from the hospital, and my parents went to bed, she confessed to me that she did not fall out of the tree, she had repeatedly hit herself with a 10 pound weight.  And that she did this twice before to her arm.  All following massive arguments that she and my mother have had.  \n\nMy seven year old sister is told repeatedly that she will grow up to be a fat, toothless, stupid loser if she doesn't behave exactly as how my mother expects.  The other day in Target, my youngest sister was wearing one of those shirts that ties in a bow in teh back, and it came untied as she was walking.  My mother responded by pulling her hair, hissing at her that she looked filthy and disgusting, and forcing her to stand in the middle of the aisle as her shirt was tied back into place.  \n\nToday, I got in trouble for snapping at my youngest sister for yelling my name repeatedly into my ear, which, I mean, she's a kid, and kids do that, but I had a headache, and I snapped \"Could you PLEASE STOP THAT\".  My sister is now not allowed in my room, or to talk to me, or to be in the same room with me, for the rest of the week at least.  Because my mother, the same woman who constantly threatens to abandon us, sell us, or call the police on us, for not doing homework in what she deems to be a timely manner, she thinks that I am a threat to my sister for yelling at her.  I don't know if she seriously believes that she is sane, or if she is just trying to convince herself that she is.\n\nShe berates us all constantly.  90% of what we hear from her is an incessant stream of everything we've ever done wrong, and how her life has been messed up since having us, despite the fact that she tried for YEARS to have kids.  She talks down to me all the time and explains the simplest things to me as if I were 12 rather than 21, and tells me that I am stupid, naive, and flighty.  Coming from the woman who never went to college because \"getting a job seemed hard\".  She doesn't contribute anything to rent, she hasn't held a job for 15 years, and I end up being responsible for all of her housework, but I am the one who's stupid, lazy, ungrateful, and ghsdiuyriuwfhdvgfahgiufd.  FUCKING HELL.    \n\nI am one year away from getting my bachelor's degree, and as soon as that paper is in my hand, I am getting as far away as humanly possible, I don't care what it takes.  I fear for my sisters.  Our dad seems to be fairly reasonable, and usually acknowledges to me that our mother is in the wrong, but he is reluctant to confront her about her behavior, and I think he feels guilty about \"betraying\" her, as she herself didn't have an ideal situation growing up.  And I feel bad about that.  And I love her.  But that does not in any way excuse what she is doing to my family.  She needs help, but lord help whoever suggests that to her.  \n\nSo to wrap up:  If I have to spend any time with her past what it takes to get my diploma, I would rather cease to exist than I would live through another day with that psychopathic bitch.  I realize that this is a bit disjointed, and I will try to go through later when I'm calmer and not hyperventilating to sort through it and rewrite so it makes sense.

The pictures were taken last night but I didn't have time to post. So let me start out by saying, without revealing too much, I'm 21 years old. Not a teenager, but not an adult. It's like the inbetween period between childhood and teenage years, but like 10 years older. I am now at the point in my life where my Mom doesn't get mad at me, she gets disappointed. Don't get me wrong, shes pretty psycho and still treats me like I'm 5, but occasionally she has her moments where she does something right and I don't fantasize about punching her in the face.\n\nSo yesterday she gets home and she comes up into my room (which I started to keep locked, but because she just got back from vacation I didn't think to lock the door.) She asks me if I want chinese food, pizza, or burgers for dinner and then goes to walk out the door, seeing the light shining through the cracks in my closet. heres how that conversation went.\n\nMom: Are you growing something in your closet\n\nMe: Yes\n\nMom: Can I see?\n\nMe: No\n\nMom: Why?\n\nMe: Because you're going to be angry\n\nMom: Are you growing marijuana\n\nMe: Yes\n\nNow let me tell you. My mom is batshit insane. Like. Irrationally crazy. What happened next was me affirming that was I was doing was illegal, I was aware of the risks, I did consult a lawyer as to what the penalties would be for her if I was caught with 1 plant of marijuana. (My brother actually, he had figured it out and to keep him from telling her I had to ask him a question relating to the law, which made him my lawyer and bound him by attourney/client privilege not to tell anyone..thanks Breaking Bad and mutual friends for teaching me great life lessons).\n\nThe first thing she said was \"This isn't Michigan.\" (referring to her entire family who have green cards). And then she said \"You're not smoking this...\" (I chuckled a bit on the inside) \"..This happens once and it's done.\"\n\nOverall, everything went better than expected. She's letting me grow it..she didn't throw it out. To be honest I think she kind of wants to try it out but doesn't want to say so. She might not be happy to the idea now but I bet she'll warm up to it.

Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, shes pretty psycho and still treats me like I&amp;#39;m 5, but occasionally she has her moments where she does something right and I don&amp;#39;t fantasize about punching her in the face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yesterday she gets home and she comes up into my room (which I started to keep locked, but because she just got back from vacation I didn&amp;#39;t think to lock the door.) She asks me if I want chinese food, pizza, or burgers for dinner and then goes to walk out the door, seeing the light shining through the cracks in my closet. heres how that conversation went.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mom: Are you growing something in your closet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Yes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mom: Can I see?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: No&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mom: Why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Because you&amp;#39;re going to be angry&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mom: Are you growing marijuana&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Yes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now let me tell you. My mom is batshit insane. Like. Irrationally crazy. What happened next was me affirming that was I was doing was illegal, I was aware of the risks, I did consult a lawyer as to what the penalties would be for her if I was caught with 1 plant of marijuana. (My brother actually, he had figured it out and to keep him from telling her I had to ask him a question relating to the law, which made him my lawyer and bound him by attourney/client privilege not to tell anyone..thanks Breaking Bad and mutual friends for teaching me great life lessons).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing she said was &amp;quot;This isn&amp;#39;t Michigan.&amp;quot; (referring to her entire family who have green cards). And then she said &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not smoking this...&amp;quot; (I chuckled a bit on the inside) &amp;quot;..This happens once and it&amp;#39;s done.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, everything went better than expected. She&amp;#39;s letting me grow it..she didn&amp;#39;t throw it out. To be honest I think she kind of wants to try it out but doesn&amp;#39;t want to say so. She might not be happy to the idea now but I bet she&amp;#39;ll warm up to it. &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/GPgtN\"&gt;Here she is.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;"}

[x-post from /r/progresspics ..wanted to share with you guys too]","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhx4","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1ljid7/cakeday_progress_from_a_converting_lurker_29m_65/","subreddit":"Fitness","stickied":false,"selftext":"http://imgur.com/a/Bb9Nc\n\nThis is not my final form.  Got a long way to go to get the body I want, and I finally believe I can do it.  I know I can.  And so I will.\n\nRather than write a new story, I'm just going to copy and paste a very long comment of mine from a weekly victory thread here in /r/fitness two weeks ago.  Any questions, please feel free to ask.  Thanks for the inspiration and information!\n\nCommencing paste in 3...2...\n\nI just started lifting for the first time since HS about two months ago-- and I never took it seriously back then.. was mandatory for football and bball, just did the bare minimum and never pushed myself in the weight room. Was a gifted athlete, but was always scrawny and I got into drugs and alcohol pretty heavy as soon as I got my driver's license. I graduated at 185lbs and a max bench of around 150. No drive, no knowledge of or concern for fitness; was just lucky enough to get by on genetics. I really just started upping protein intake, taking multis and other supplements, and lifting heavy --actually pushing myself-- about a month ago.\n\n\n\nI got on the scale in late March of this year for the first time in ages and it read 246 (I'm 6'5\" and turn 30 in mid October btw). I nearly fainted. That night I threw out all my junk food and went to the grocery store to start my new diet; my new lifestyle. I started doing push-ups, crunches, and jumping rope every single fucking day. Pushing myself for the first time in over a decade. I started playing basketball at least twice a week. Made some new friends and finally started to shake the rust off. After about a month I wasn't always picked last anymore!\n\n\n\nI should note that a bad breakup really aided me in keeping the fire burning. I fell into a pretty nasty depression for the first time in my life and exercising was about the only thing that made me feel even a little bit better. Fucking oneitis. I also quit smoking pot three times a day. Haven't had a single puff since 4/20 and I don't plan on ever touching it again.\n\n\n\nAbout the middle of June I hit my goal weight of 195lbs. My pants fell off me, my XL shirts looked huge, I had to buy new underwear and belts, I had friends and relatives telling me I was \"too skinny\" -- something I hadn't heard in a long, long time. I was eating about 1400 healthy calories a day and exercising for a little less than 3 months and lost 50 pounds. Too fast, I know. But I still had no knowledge of proper dieting and didn't really care to. I just wanted to not be fat anymore and I wanted to make it happen yesterday. I only ate tuna, beef, chicken, fruits, vegetables, brown rice, cottage cheese, eggs, and whole wheat bread. I still allowed myself 3 Cokes a week (sweet, sweet nectar) but other than that I only drank water. I cheated twice during that span. I stopped drinking, it was empty calories and hangovers suck even worse when you're battling depression. I could dunk two handed again, vert.\n\n\n\nThen I got food poisoning. The sickest I've ever been for 4 days. Dropped to 184 during that thanks to severe dehydration. Looked at myself in the mirror while I was ill and I looked scrawny again. I looked terrible. I looked weak. I was weak and scrawny. While I was out of work those 4 days I stumbled on /r/fitness and /r/leangains. Information overload. Fuck this skinny noise. Now I wanna be ripped. I read about SS, SL, etc etc.. But meh, I'm still kinda on the fence. I did download the SL app, though I've yet to use it. Medhi is too much of a salesman! Hah.\n\n\n\nMy cousin/roommate is a gym rat and a beast; bearmode through and through. So I go with him to Gold's one day. Intimidated and overwhelmed doesn't begin to describe the feeling. But he showed me what to do (it was his chest&amp;tris day) and I did my best to keep up. The DOMS, ohhhh the DOMS.\n\n\n\nSo I go to Gold's with him when possible and by myself (and am too scared/unfamiliar to really push myself, so I do sissy workouts) when I gotta until my two week trial is up. I went 6 times in the 2 weeks, three alone and three with him. I'm not totally convinced I'm into it yet so instead of signing up or calling it quits, I go to the local YMCA to see if I can score a trial membership there. I do (happened to know the girl working the desk). They have a men's bball league about to start and a nice big pool that's heated in winter and cooled in summer. While their weight equipment is shit compared to Gold's they have all the basics, which is all I really want/need at this point anyway. The membership is much more expensive than Gold's and the hours kinda suck, but with the pool and the indoor gymnasium (basketball in the evenings had been getting rained out constantly; summertime in Florida) I can justify that. After my trial runs out I sign up at the Y after convincing them to drop the joiner fee.\n\n\n\nThen I recruit my sister's long term boyfriend who's a friend of mine, a generally great guy, long time serious lifter, and also a behemoth to come to the Y with me and show me the ropes. I tell him I want to look like him. That's when shit got real. He teaches me how to squat, deadlift, bench properly. He doesn't let me touch the EZ curl bar. He tells me to suck it up. This guy is knowledgable and he's great for inspiration. Nothing like watching someone warm up with your max. I get more out of one workout with him present than I do out of three if I'm left to my own devices. So during his two week trial membership at the Y we hit it 5 days a week together. I'm catching the bug. The last day of his trial we stop by GNC afterwards. I get some creatine, a pre-workout, and some yummy ON whey protein. I'm on my own now. Shit, bummer. He starts talking about how he'll miss it..I know I'm gonna miss it more. Tells me he'll leave Gold's and join the Y if I pay the difference. He's $20/mo at Gold's month to month, friends with the manager. He and my sister have a baby on the way, so after thinking about it I say fuck it I'll pay for your entire membership. He's the cheapest personal trainer ever and he's the father of my niece or nephew to be. Want him to save his $. We hit the Y 4 times a week together, running a split he's been doing for years and I go twice on my own for bball and some accessory work.\n\n\n\nThis is getting long and has turned into rambling so I'll get succinct. I was doing 135x10, 155x10, 185x8, 135 to failure for my bench sets. My \"trainer\" has helped my form immensely since we started going together and has been telling me since we started that I'm stronger than I think I am. Last Wednesday was chest/tri's. He always goes first, so we load up 225 and he does 12 close grip warmup reps. I go to take a plate off for my set and he looks at me and does a Motumbo-esque finger wag (http://www.gifbay.com/gif/dikembe_mutombo_finger_wag-53668/) and motions for me to get my ass on the bench. I don't go close grip, but with some Deftones (\"Drive\") blaring I psych myself up and bust out 3 steady reps and he doesn't even touch the bar. Felt fucking great.\n\n\n\nI haven't had a Coke in two weeks and I'm down to 5 cigarettes a day unless I go out at night. Planning on trying to completely cut it out October 1st. It's the last of my unhealthy habits, but also the toughest to kick. I know I've got the willpower now though, look at everything else I've done. And there's no way I wanna be a smoker at age 30.\n\n\n\nAlso, my bball team is 3-1 and I'm averaging 14 points a game!\nI've come a long way in a little under five months and I'm just getting started. Can't wait to see my numbers, what I look like, and how I feel this time next year! If I can do it, anyone can. Also, after this bball league is over I'm pretty sure I'm going to Gold's! Fuck the bball, the pool, the cardio! I wanna lift!\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Yes, I added 20+ lbs in one go. I was selling myself short. I was being a pussy. I'm done being a pussy.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading, and thanks for all the encouragement you've given me so far, /r/fitness!\n","created_utc":1378075315,"is_self":true,"link_flair_css_class":null,"media":null,"ups":169,"author_flair_css_class":null,"mod_reports":[],"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/Bb9Nc\"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/Bb9Nc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not my final form.

Got a long way to go to get the body I want, and I finally believe I can do it.  I know I can.  And so I will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather than write a new story, I&amp;#39;m just going to copy and paste a very long comment of mine from a weekly victory thread in &lt;a href=\"/r/fitness\"&gt;/r/fitness&lt;/a&gt; two weeks ago.  Any questions, please feel free to ask.  Thanks for the inspiration!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Commencing paste in 3...2...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just started lifting for the first time since HS about two months ago-- and I never took it seriously back then.. was mandatory for football and bball, just did the bare minimum and never pushed myself in the weight room. Was a gifted athlete, but was always scrawny and I got into drugs and alcohol pretty heavy as soon as I got my driver&amp;#39;s license. I graduated at 185lbs and a max bench of around 150. No drive, no knowledge of or concern for fitness; was just lucky enough to get by on genetics. I really just started upping protein intake, taking multis and other supplements, and lifting heavy --actually pushing myself-- about a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got on the scale in late March of this year for the first time in ages and it read 246 (I&amp;#39;m 6&amp;#39;5&amp;quot; and turn 30 in mid October btw). I nearly fainted. That night I threw out all my junk food and went to the grocery store to start my new diet; my new lifestyle. I started doing push-ups, crunches, and jumping rope every single fucking day. Pushing myself for the first time in over a decade. I started playing basketball at least twice a week. Made some new friends and finally started to shake the rust off. After about a month I wasn&amp;#39;t always picked last anymore!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should note that a bad breakup really aided me in keeping the fire burning. I fell into a pretty nasty depression for the first time in my life and exercising was about the only thing that made me feel even a little bit better. Fucking oneitis. I also quit smoking pot three times a day. Haven&amp;#39;t had a single puff since 4/20 and I don&amp;#39;t plan on ever touching it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About the middle of June I hit my goal weight of 195lbs. My pants fell off me, my XL shirts looked huge, I had to buy new underwear and belts, I had friends and relatives telling me I was &amp;quot;too skinny&amp;quot; -- something I hadn&amp;#39;t heard in a long, long time. I was eating about 1400 healthy calories a day and exercising for a little less than 3 months and lost 50 pounds. Too fast, I know. But I still had no knowledge of proper dieting and didn&amp;#39;t really care to. I just wanted to not be fat anymore and I wanted to make it happen yesterday. I only ate tuna, beef, chicken, fruits, vegetables, brown rice, cottage cheese, eggs, and whole wheat bread. I still allowed myself 3 Cokes a week (sweet, sweet nectar) but other than that I only drank water. I cheated twice during that span. I stopped drinking, it was empty calories and hangovers suck even worse when you&amp;#39;re battling depression. I could dunk two handed again, vert.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I got food poisoning. The sickest I&amp;#39;ve ever been for 4 days. Dropped to 184 during that thanks to severe dehydration. Looked at myself in the mirror while I was ill and I looked scrawny again. I looked terrible. I looked weak. I was weak and scrawny. While I was out of work those 4 days I stumbled on &lt;a href=\"/r/fitness\"&gt;/r/fitness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/r/leangains\"&gt;/r/leangains&lt;/a&gt;. Information overload. Fuck this skinny noise. Now I wanna be ripped. I read about SS, SL, etc etc.. But meh, I&amp;#39;m still kinda on the fence. I did download the SL app, though I&amp;#39;ve yet to use it. Medhi is too much of a salesman! Hah.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My cousin/roommate is a gym rat and a beast; bearmode through and through. So I go with him to Gold&amp;#39;s one day. Intimidated and overwhelmed doesn&amp;#39;t begin to describe the feeling. But he showed me what to do (it was his chest&amp;amp;tris day) and I did my best to keep up. The DOMS, ohhhh the DOMS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I go to Gold&amp;#39;s with him when possible and by myself (and am too scared/unfamiliar to really push myself, so I do sissy workouts) when I gotta until my two week trial is up. I went 6 times in the 2 weeks, three alone and three with him. I&amp;#39;m not totally convinced I&amp;#39;m into it yet so instead of signing up or calling it quits, I go to the local YMCA to see if I can score a trial membership there. I do (happened to know the girl working the desk). They have a men&amp;#39;s bball league about to start and a nice big pool that&amp;#39;s heated in winter and cooled in summer. While their weight equipment is shit compared to Gold&amp;#39;s they have all the basics, which is all I really want/need at this point anyway. The membership is much more expensive than Gold&amp;#39;s and the hours kinda suck, but with the pool and the indoor gymnasium (basketball in the evenings had been getting rained out constantly; summertime in Florida) I can justify that. After my trial runs out I sign up at the Y after convincing them to drop the joiner fee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I recruit my sister&amp;#39;s long term boyfriend who&amp;#39;s a friend of mine, a generally great guy, long time serious lifter, and also a behemoth to come to the Y with me and show me the ropes. I tell him I want to look like him. That&amp;#39;s when shit got real. He teaches me how to squat, deadlift, bench properly. He doesn&amp;#39;t let me touch the EZ curl bar. He tells me to suck it up. This guy is knowledgable and he&amp;#39;s great for inspiration. Nothing like watching someone warm up with your max. I get more out of one workout with him present than I do out of three if I&amp;#39;m left to my own devices. So during his two week trial membership at the Y we hit it 5 days a week together. I&amp;#39;m catching the bug. The last day of his trial we stop by GNC afterwards. I get some creatine, a pre-workout, and some yummy ON whey protein. I&amp;#39;m on my own now. Shit, bummer. He starts talking about how he&amp;#39;ll miss it..I know I&amp;#39;m gonna miss it more. Tells me he&amp;#39;ll leave Gold&amp;#39;s and join the Y if I pay the difference. He&amp;#39;s $20/mo at Gold&amp;#39;s month to month, friends with the manager. He and my sister have a baby on the way, so after thinking about it I say fuck it I&amp;#39;ll pay for your entire membership. He&amp;#39;s the cheapest personal trainer ever and he&amp;#39;s the father of my niece or nephew to be. Want him to save his $. We hit the Y 4 times a week together, running a split he&amp;#39;s been doing for years and I go twice on my own for bball and some accessory work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is getting long and has turned into rambling so I&amp;#39;ll get succinct. I was doing 135x10, 155x10, 185x8, 135 to failure for my bench sets. My &amp;quot;trainer&amp;quot; has helped my form immensely since we started going together and has been telling me since we started that I&amp;#39;m stronger than I think I am. Last Wednesday was chest/tri&amp;#39;s. He always goes first, so we load up 225 and he does 12 close grip warmup reps. I go to take a plate off for my set and he looks at me and does a Motumbo-esque finger wag (&lt;a href=\"http://www.gifbay.com/gif/dikembe_mutombo_finger_wag-53668/\"&gt;http://www.gifbay.com/gif/dikembe_mutombo_finger_wag-53668/&lt;/a&gt;) and motions for me to get my ass on the bench. I don&amp;#39;t go close grip, but with some Deftones (&amp;quot;Drive&amp;quot;) blaring I psych myself up and bust out 3 steady reps and he doesn&amp;#39;t even touch the bar. Felt fucking great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t had a Coke in two weeks and I&amp;#39;m down to 5 cigarettes a day unless I go out at night. Planning on trying to completely cut it out October 1st. It&amp;#39;s the last of my unhealthy habits, but also the toughest to kick. I know I&amp;#39;ve got the willpower now though, look at everything else I&amp;#39;ve done. And there&amp;#39;s no way I wanna be a smoker at age 30.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, my bball team is 3-1 and I&amp;#39;m averaging 14 points a game!\nI&amp;#39;ve come a long way in a little under five months and I&amp;#39;m just getting started. Can&amp;#39;t wait to see my numbers, what I look like, and how I feel this time next year! If I can do it, anyone can.

Got a long way to go to get the body I want, and I finally believe I can do it.  I know I can.  And so I will.\n\nRather than write a new story, I'm just going to copy and paste a very long comment of mine from a weekly victory thread in /r/fitness two weeks ago.  Any questions, please feel free to ask.  Thanks for the inspiration!\n\nCommencing paste in 3...2...\n\nI just started lifting for the first time since HS about two months ago-- and I never took it seriously back then.. was mandatory for football and bball, just did the bare minimum and never pushed myself in the weight room. Was a gifted athlete, but was always scrawny and I got into drugs and alcohol pretty heavy as soon as I got my driver's license. I graduated at 185lbs and a max bench of around 150. No drive, no knowledge of or concern for fitness; was just lucky enough to get by on genetics. I really just started upping protein intake, taking multis and other supplements, and lifting heavy --actually pushing myself-- about a month ago.\n\n\n\nI got on the scale in late March of this year for the first time in ages and it read 246 (I'm 6'5\" and turn 30 in mid October btw). I nearly fainted. That night I threw out all my junk food and went to the grocery store to start my new diet; my new lifestyle. I started doing push-ups, crunches, and jumping rope every single fucking day. Pushing myself for the first time in over a decade. I started playing basketball at least twice a week. Made some new friends and finally started to shake the rust off. After about a month I wasn't always picked last anymore!\n\n\n\nI should note that a bad breakup really aided me in keeping the fire burning. I fell into a pretty nasty depression for the first time in my life and exercising was about the only thing that made me feel even a little bit better. Fucking oneitis. I also quit smoking pot three times a day. Haven't had a single puff since 4/20 and I don't plan on ever touching it again.\n\n\n\nAbout the middle of June I hit my goal weight of 195lbs. My pants fell off me, my XL shirts looked huge, I had to buy new underwear and belts, I had friends and relatives telling me I was \"too skinny\" -- something I hadn't heard in a long, long time. I was eating about 1400 healthy calories a day and exercising for a little less than 3 months and lost 50 pounds. Too fast, I know. But I still had no knowledge of proper dieting and didn't really care to. I just wanted to not be fat anymore and I wanted to make it happen yesterday. I only ate tuna, beef, chicken, fruits, vegetables, brown rice, cottage cheese, eggs, and whole wheat bread. I still allowed myself 3 Cokes a week (sweet, sweet nectar) but other than that I only drank water. I cheated twice during that span. I stopped drinking, it was empty calories and hangovers suck even worse when you're battling depression. I could dunk two handed again, vert.\n\n\n\nThen I got food poisoning. The sickest I've ever been for 4 days. Dropped to 184 during that thanks to severe dehydration. Looked at myself in the mirror while I was ill and I looked scrawny again. I looked terrible. I looked weak. I was weak and scrawny. While I was out of work those 4 days I stumbled on /r/fitness and /r/leangains. Information overload. Fuck this skinny noise. Now I wanna be ripped. I read about SS, SL, etc etc.. But meh, I'm still kinda on the fence. I did download the SL app, though I've yet to use it. Medhi is too much of a salesman! Hah.\n\n\n\nMy cousin/roommate is a gym rat and a beast; bearmode through and through. So I go with him to Gold's one day. Intimidated and overwhelmed doesn't begin to describe the feeling. But he showed me what to do (it was his chest&amp;tris day) and I did my best to keep up. The DOMS, ohhhh the DOMS.\n\n\n\nSo I go to Gold's with him when possible and by myself (and am too scared/unfamiliar to really push myself, so I do sissy workouts) when I gotta until my two week trial is up. I went 6 times in the 2 weeks, three alone and three with him. I'm not totally convinced I'm into it yet so instead of signing up or calling it quits, I go to the local YMCA to see if I can score a trial membership there. I do (happened to know the girl working the desk). They have a men's bball league about to start and a nice big pool that's heated in winter and cooled in summer. While their weight equipment is shit compared to Gold's they have all the basics, which is all I really want/need at this point anyway. The membership is much more expensive than Gold's and the hours kinda suck, but with the pool and the indoor gymnasium (basketball in the evenings had been getting rained out constantly; summertime in Florida) I can justify that. After my trial runs out I sign up at the Y after convincing them to drop the joiner fee.\n\n\n\nThen I recruit my sister's long term boyfriend who's a friend of mine, a generally great guy, long time serious lifter, and also a behemoth to come to the Y with me and show me the ropes. I tell him I want to look like him. That's when shit got real. He teaches me how to squat, deadlift, bench properly. He doesn't let me touch the EZ curl bar. He tells me to suck it up. This guy is knowledgable and he's great for inspiration. Nothing like watching someone warm up with your max. I get more out of one workout with him present than I do out of three if I'm left to my own devices. So during his two week trial membership at the Y we hit it 5 days a week together. I'm catching the bug. The last day of his trial we stop by GNC afterwards. I get some creatine, a pre-workout, and some yummy ON whey protein. I'm on my own now. Shit, bummer. He starts talking about how he'll miss it..I know I'm gonna miss it more. Tells me he'll leave Gold's and join the Y if I pay the difference. He's $20/mo at Gold's month to month, friends with the manager. He and my sister have a baby on the way, so after thinking about it I say fuck it I'll pay for your entire membership. He's the cheapest personal trainer ever and he's the father of my niece or nephew to be. Want him to save his $. We hit the Y 4 times a week together, running a split he's been doing for years and I go twice on my own for bball and some accessory work.\n\n\n\nThis is getting long and has turned into rambling so I'll get succinct. I was doing 135x10, 155x10, 185x8, 135 to failure for my bench sets. My \"trainer\" has helped my form immensely since we started going together and has been telling me since we started that I'm stronger than I think I am. Last Wednesday was chest/tri's. He always goes first, so we load up 225 and he does 12 close grip warmup reps. I go to take a plate off for my set and he looks at me and does a Motumbo-esque finger wag (http://www.gifbay.com/gif/dikembe_mutombo_finger_wag-53668/) and motions for me to get my ass on the bench. I don't go close grip, but with some Deftones (\"Drive\") blaring I psych myself up and bust out 3 steady reps and he doesn't even touch the bar. Felt fucking great.\n\n\n\nI haven't had a Coke in two weeks and I'm down to 5 cigarettes a day unless I go out at night. Planning on trying to completely cut it out October 1st. It's the last of my unhealthy habits, but also the toughest to kick. I know I've got the willpower now though, look at everything else I've done. And there's no way I wanna be a smoker at age 30.\n\n\n\nAlso, my bball team is 3-1 and I'm averaging 14 points a game!\nI've come a long way in a little under five months and I'm just getting started. Can't wait to see my numbers, what I look like, and how I feel this time next year! If I can do it, anyone can. Also, after this bball league is over I'm pretty sure I'm going to Gold's! Fuck the bball, the pool, the cardio! I wanna lift!\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Yes, I added 20+ lbs in one go. I was selling myself short. I was being a pussy. I'm done being a pussy.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading, and thanks for all the encouragement you've given me so far, /r/fitness!\n\n","ups":69,"author_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"media":null}

Now I'm back home and nothing's changed. Well, except for the fact that my mother and grandmother entered some kind of stand-off while I was away and haven't spoken to each other at all in months.\n\nSo I felt sorry for my grandmother- without being able to talk to my mum, she hadn't been able to talk to or see my siblings in all that time, and being the loving grandmother that she is had been missing her younger grandchildren (that's not sarcasm btw- she shows us all genuine affection, it's never two-faced and she's done an incredible amount for all of us growing up). I arranged for them to be dropped off at my grandparents without my mum and granny having to see each other- fantastic. Except now that THAT's sorted, and my grandmother can't talk to my mum about any of this (not that the situation was different before all of this) she's started telling ME about how my mum has got to get up and moving around, she only has a mobility scooter \"because she's too fat to walk comfortably and the scooter helps her ignore the problem\". My sister has chosen \"all the wrong subjects\" for her A-levels and needs to be told to change them and move schools- doesn't matter how, it's got to be done, and because my mum won't do it, apparently it's my job. Meanwhile my other sister, who's always been thin, has got even skinnier, and it must be because \"your mum eats all the food while her children go hungry\" (ok that quote's actually from my mum's sister-in-law). My mum has told me my sister's been diagnosed with a potential eating disorder as a result of her autism, which means when she obsesses over stuff and one of the things she obsesses over is food (she once told the doctor \"if I didn't have to eat food, I'd just stop, eating is really boring\"). The local high school's not good enough for my little brother in my grandmother's book, and he should be moved to a different one, which my mum says he's not in the right town for. Then finally there's the fact my mum's been unemployed for years having seriously injured her back at work, her back's only got worse since then, but she's still coping fine, does household chores and stuff with my siblings (and me when I'm home), goes out with them on her scooter to walk the dogs and take them swimming and to school sometimes (though they're all old enough to walk on their own and it's a 15 minute walk which is why this isn't a regular thing that she goes with them. I lend her money from time to time when she needs/asks for it and she seems to be doing ok, not great but ok, financially.\n\nDespite all of this, I should be telling my mum how to organise her budget, send my siblings to different schools, etc etc. I am about ready to punch a wall or bite a tree or something in frustration at the whole thing- my mum's not an imbecile, and I can't just go home and tell her how to live her life, and how to bring up her kids (I'm 21 unmarried and without kids, what in the blue fucking hell do I know about raising 2 teenagers and an almost-teenager, even if I were as arrogant as to assume I had any right to order my mum how to raise them?!).\n\nRight that's about it...living with my grandparents for the next month because it's quiet here in the country and when I'm not being given lectures about my mum it's a decent place to study (I have finals coming up next summer so figure I'll get a head-start on the next semester's work now).

It's one of the most tedious and annoying jobs you can have. Sometimes she is scheduled as a cashier (which she loves) most of the time it's recovery. We will call her Chick.\n\nMy store manager is a fat lazy woman who does NOTHING at work. She pushes all of her work onto other people and walks around and talks on the phone to her friends all day! She is also VERY incompetent in her duties. We will call her S&amp;M.\n\nI myself have a tendency to be a little sluggish some days, where as others I work my ass off more than anyone there. One thing that about me is I have very strong morals, beliefs, and values in my life that I will stand up for no matter what. One of which is Labor Day. And so our journey begins....\n\n\nIt all started a couple weeks ago. I told my S&amp;M that I would close one day that week. When I got to work Chick was already scheduled to close for her, so I thought \"What the heck am I doing here?\" I asked Chick what was going on and she said she was originally scheduled as a cashier, but they changed her to recovery and wanted me to be cashier. I knew how much Chick hated recovery so I made a decision. I let her have the shift. I helped her out by going around the entire store and picking up everything off the shelves and brought them up front and put them into the baskets that they were suppose to go into. No harm no foul right? She even recovered half the story WHILE cashiering.\n\nWell that pissed my S&amp;M off. Something serious I guess, so she hired 2 new employee's. Now, this is my fault, and I accept that. I figured the store was closed on Labor Day, so I didn't request for it off. All of my other jobs were off that day, so I didn't think anything of it. I should have realized that it was a retail store and it doesn't close for holidays like that. My fault. So I look at the schedule Saturday and I was put on for closing Monday (Labor Day). I looked at the S&amp;M and I said, \"I don't work on Labor Day, it's just how I am.\" So another co-worker overheard me say that and she came up to me and the Manager and said, \"I requested Wednesday off, but you have me scheduled. I have something to do that day.\" She looked at me and said, \"I will take your Monday if you take my Wednesday.\" I agreed. \n\nWell holy fucking shit storm did that piss her off. So apparently in her mind I don't ever come in when I say I'm going to. So sense the S&amp;M is a little bitch basically (She won't confront anyone to their face, she will get the other managers to do it.) she got another manager to confront me about it.\n\n\"You need to stop playing around with that shit or your gonna keep losing hours!\"\n\nSo of course I was like, \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"That Labor Day shit. You never come to work when you say you are going to and if you keep it up, you are gonna be fired. You have a bad track-record and you need to stop playing games.\"\n\nSo I went to work thinking about what she just said to me. I didn't want to reply at that instant because I'm not stupid. I know that if I said anything it would be a jumbled mess of nonsense. So I thought, and thought about what she just told me, and I walked up to her and I said, \"I'm confused, when did I ever say I was going to work? And when have I EVER said I would come to work and not show up?\"\nSo she brought up the thing with Chick and how I left that day. I said, \"I understand that, but she was already scheduled and I didn't want to take her hours like an asshole.\"\n\nSo she said, \"If they are there, take them.\" I said, \"No, I'm not a dick. If she was scheduled then she should work. It is S&amp;M's fault for messing up the schedule in the first place.\" To which she replied, \"That doesn't matter, this isn't the first time this has happened.\" I said, \"Name a time. Just name one, off the top of your head, when has that ever happened?\"\n\nShe couldn't all she could say was that it had happened before and it was too long ago to remember (Haha, funny attempt at trying to derail her statement.)\n\nI said, \"What's the big deal anyways? So what I don't work on Labor Days, why is that such a problem?\" So she kept going on about how I didn't do what I say I was gonna do (which is utter bullshit because I do and she knows it) and that if it was her decision she would have left me on the schedule and if I didn't come in she would have fired me.\n\n\nHold the fuck up. Is what I was thinking and feeling at the time. \"Wait, a minute. That's bullshit, who are you to decide how I live my life and who I am as a person? It is MY belief that I don't work on Labor Day. It's something I have ALWAYS believed in, and no-one is going to change it.\"\n\nShe said that's not a belief and that if I was a Christian who wouldn't work on Sundays that would be different. So at this point I kinda flipped. \"Who are you to tell me what I can and cannot believe in. Even if my belief isn't one of your own, and it's not that significant to you it is STILL significant to me in my life. Who are you to decide what I should care about and what I shouldn't care about in my life. You have absolutely NO right to judge me and who I am as a person and you need to stop trying to push your own personal perspective of life on to other people if it doesn't fit with your own agenda. You are NOT my mother and you have no right to do that. Only God can judge me. Not you!\"\n\nSo she got pissed and tried to pull out her authoritah on me. \"I'm a manager and I can decide what ever I want!\" Blah blah blah. So my retort was simple. \"How does being a manager give you the right to be judgmental about other people and decide who and what they should believe in? Who gave you more rights as a human being than anyone else on this planet? No-one.\"\n\nWell all she could say after that was that I needed to grow up. Once again, I flipped. \"Grow up? Really, that's all you have to say now. First off, I am grown (I'm 23 btw, I know still young, but not a child.) and you know what I've learned over the years about being an adult? First, always accept responsibilities for your own actions, whether they are good or bad. Never push blame onto someone else. That's childish. And second, You have to have beliefs, morals, and values that are worth standing-up for in your life or else people will walk all over you like an ant and use you for their own purposes.\"\n\n\nDramatic pause....dun-dun-dun.\n\n\"So who's the adult? Me who has both? Or you who is acting like a child and trying to force your own life onto me. I am not YOU and you are not ME. We are two different people, and you need to step out of your little bubble of a world because it doesn't revolve around you.\"\n\nSo that was the end of it. There were customers that heard it and just kinda smiled at me when they were checking out.\n\nAnywho some advice would be nice... or comments. Did I do the right thing for my self? Did I over-react?\n\nEven so, I regret nothing!","is_self":true,"title":"A long story about something that happened today.

I go to a well known private university, I dress like a \"normal\" teenager, go out and do social things with friends. If you saw me on the street I'm sure you wouldn't think twice about my fitting into society.For some reason when I'm inside my mind though I am plagued by the sort of thoughts described below. I mostly just want to share this because I don't want my family or friends to think I'm some disturbed, messed up child. Nor do I want to hear how you think I should talk to somebody about this. That is something I will decide on my own. Lastly, if you think I posted this in the wrong subreddit, please guide me to a more appropriate one. Thanks\nI hear a lot about life being a gift, but there are moments that I wonder if thats actually true; sometimes it seems more like a curse. Sure there are good times, great times even, but does it make up for all the heartache and grief we experience throughout our lives. Being a conscious organism has it's upsides, such as having intelligence and being able to invent things out of our own minds, but it also makes us painfully aware of all the anguish in the world, a world who's significance only lies within itself. Outside of our atmosphere we are merely a rock of land and water floating in the cold vacuum of space, a mere blip on the vast canvas of the universe. Are we alone or are there others out there? Is there really any point to being alive other than purely existing because of some highly improbable coincidence that we call the Big Bang? Do we actually know anything or is our entire civilization solely based on superficial ideas and behaviors. When you think about it, some of society's most crucial problems are only a product of our own irrational conduct. Wars, economic downturns, and discrimination are all a result of human behavior: flawed and ignorant. These are problems that wouldn't have otherwise existed in nature. For some reason we find the need to place limitations on ourselves: time, money, language barriers, country borders, governments. While these these facets of life may catalyze progress and advancement they often hinder happiness and individualism. We are forced to conform to the standards of the masses, which only makes us feel all the more lost in a world where no one is the same.

I go to a well known private university, I dress like a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; teenager, go out and do social things with friends. If you saw me on the street I&amp;#39;m sure you wouldn&amp;#39;t think twice about my fitting into society.For some reason when I&amp;#39;m inside my mind though I am plagued by the sort of thoughts described below. I mostly just want to share this because I don&amp;#39;t want my family or friends to think I&amp;#39;m some disturbed, messed up child. Nor do I want to hear how you think I should talk to somebody about this. That is something I will decide on my own. Lastly, if you think I posted this in the wrong subreddit, please guide me to a more appropriate one. Thanks\nI hear a lot about life being a gift, but there are moments that I wonder if thats actually true; sometimes it seems more like a curse. Sure there are good times, great times even, but does it make up for all the heartache and grief we experience throughout our lives. Being a conscious organism has it&amp;#39;s upsides, such as having intelligence and being able to invent things out of our own minds, but it also makes us painfully aware of all the anguish in the world, a world who&amp;#39;s significance only lies within itself. Outside of our atmosphere we are merely a rock of land and water floating in the cold vacuum of space, a mere blip on the vast canvas of the universe. Are we alone or are there others out there? Is there really any point to being alive other than purely existing because of some highly improbable coincidence that we call the Big Bang? Do we actually know anything or is our entire civilization solely based on superficial ideas and behaviors. When you think about it, some of society&amp;#39;s most crucial problems are only a product of our own irrational conduct. Wars, economic downturns, and discrimination are all a result of human behavior: flawed and ignorant. These are problems that wouldn&amp;#39;t have otherwise existed in nature. For some reason we find the need to place limitations on ourselves: time, money, language barriers, country borders, governments. While these these facets of life may catalyze progress and advancement they often hinder happiness and individualism. We are forced to conform to the standards of the masses, which only makes us feel all the more lost in a world where no one is the same. Everyone is just trying to find their place in this world but the way society is structured leaves a lot of us out in the cold. We act like we know everything, but in fact it seems like we know nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","mod_reports":[],"thumbnail":"default","report_reasons":null,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"edited":false}

Anyways, I&amp;#39;m a boy, a single child, and live with just my mom.

If she doesn&amp;#39;t talk to their parents, I&amp;#39;m not allowed to go.

This is pretty much how things works whenever I invite friends over, they pretty much casually come over and call their parents to assure them that they&amp;#39;re safe and okay and my mom thinks that&amp;#39;s bad parenting and that they&amp;#39;re letting their kids be &lt;em&gt;loose&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt;(despite some of them having really good grades and being the most respectful and polite kids you&amp;#39;ll probably ever meet).

{"created_utc":1378062217,"selftext":"Hi MMFB. I've posted here before, and found it really helpful to just let people know how I feel. Thanks for listening. Sorry for the wall of text.\n\nI've had an up and down adventure with mental illness - a general physician diagnosed me with depression, put me on Zoloft, and within a month I was in a full-blown manic episode. I started seeing a psychiatrist, who took me off the anti-depressant, and decided I have generalized anxiety disorder and sent me off with some Xanax. Things were fine for a couple of months, but not great. In February of this year, my boyfriend went back to school, which is 10+ hours from where I go to school. We started fighting, sleeping around, etc. I felt horrible and miserable. Couldn't sleep, didn't want to eat, made a lot of stupid, irrational choices. I went back to my psych, who diagnosed me with Bipolar disorder and put me on Depakote, a mood stabilizer. Again, everything seemed to go back to normal, I made up with my boyfriend, visited him, did well in classes. For another 3 months or so, I was doing great. However, the mood stabilizer had the (un)fortunate effect of stabilizing my mood - I wasn't sad anymore, but I couldn't be happy either. I discussed this with my psychiatrist, and he said we could consider taking me off of it, as he decided I was \"the 1 in 100 bi-polar people who might not need a mood stabilizer.\" Unfortunately, due to an exam, I missed my next appointment. Because of this, he refused to see me until September (as in now.) I found a new psychiatrist, explained everything, and he decided to take me off Depakote. \n\nBy now it is summer of 2013, I'm living with boyfriend, working at an internship I love, very low stress life, etc. I slowly taper off the Depakote and I feel better than I ever have in my life. My anxiety was under control, I'm not sad, I felt, for three months at least, like a little kid again. \n\nBut in the past few days that's all gone away. My boyfriend is studying abroad in Europe, so he's not around the time anymore, and I don't get to talk to him as much as I used to. My internship is finished up, so I have no major responsibilities to commit myself to. I'm living in a city that isn't where I grew up or where I went to school, so I know relatively few people. I feel like I'm doing everything I can (trying to eat well, exercise, get enough sleep, work on my thoughts and do meditation) and yet everything is spiraling out of control. Over the summer I took xanax once - at the airport when my flight was delayed and I got very anxious. I've taken it every day for the past three days. \n\nI've been working with my therapist and my psychiatrist on cognitive behavioral therapy to figure out what exactly is wrong. Growing up, I had a very poor relationship with my Dad and his family. I was frequently neglected by them (I haven't received so much as a birthday card in 10 years, I'm 21.) Since elementary school, no achievement, project, or venture was enough to satisfy them or gain their approval and affection. My dad stopped coming to band concerts, plays, and science fairs. On my 16th birthday, which is very close to my cousin's birthday, my Grandparents threw a party, primarily for my cousin, where they gave him a new car. I got a gift card to Barnes and Noble. I think, because of this, I've become very insecure and am constantly hounded by feelings of inadequacy. \n\nNow I've whipped myself up into a lather over my boyfriend. Again I feel like I'm hounded persistently by thoughts that he's going to leave me, that I'm not good/cool/attractive enough, etc. I'm excited for him and his time studying abroad, but when he tells me about going clubbing and taking hard drugs I end up worried - worried for his safety, but mostly worried that because I'm in some faceless Midwestern City sitting on my ass eating bonbons and not rolling on e in a cosmopolitan European powerhouse that he'll get tired of me and leave me. I've had some shitty boyfriends in the past, who have cheated on me, broken up via phonecall, and I'm just afraid it's going to happen again. I have really no reason to - my Boyfriend is always excited to talk and makes a huge effort to make time to communicate. \n\nWe've also discussed experimenting with openness, and when we decided on it back in August, I felt really comfortable with it. We set clear boundaries and rules, and it seemed like something I could be comfortable. Now I see that as another locus of inadequacy - what happens if we decide to do that and he's out fucking hot eurodudes and I'm stuck in my small college town staring out the window, drinking wine, and feeling sorry for myself?\n\nI want to tell him all of this, but I'm afraid he'll think I'm nuts. He struggles with mental health issues as well, and has been dealing with those in adjusting to life in a foreign country, and I don't want to give him more to deal with. \n\nAt this point, everything seems wrong. Part of me wants to go out and party and do drugs, and another part of me wants to crawl in bed and cry. Everything feels lose-lose-lose for me and win-win-win-win for everyone else. \n\nI don't know what I expect out of this post, except to get my thoughts down in the universe and maybe a kind word. Thanks for reading.\n\nTLDR: Shitty dad treated me like crap, feelings of inadequacy, jealousy, and insecurity crippling my relationship and personal life.
