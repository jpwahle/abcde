So I emailed him with a quick shot of me (I&amp;quot;m a bigger guy and I find most of the guys in town here are usually looking for the skinny Daniel Radcliffe type) but he responded! turns out he&amp;#39;s into bigger guys and wants to meet up, well work and scheduling it took almost a week before we could meet, chatting each day for a bit talking about how we would ravish each other bodies making both of us hotter and hotter in anticipation.  and how I&amp;#39;m a bit of a newbie and have never had a man really make love to me which turned him on even more.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So finally Friday night comes and I go over to his place, and knock on the door he opens it up and it&amp;#39;s on! Raw animalistic passion sweeps over both of us he pulls me through the door and kisses me deeply making my cock start to stiffen in my pants, I wanted him so bad at this point I fumble to get the door closed behind me so the neighbors don&amp;#39;t get a show. I push him away for a moment so I can get my jacket and boots off and then he leads me to his bedroom, my hands down the back of his pants playing with his amazing buns, we get to the bedroom and its back on, kissing and necking him unbuttoning my shirt and I pulling his pants down and shirt up, he smelled amazing making me want him even more. We pulled away from each other to get fully naked and admire each others bodies He was amazed by me &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re so hot my big teddy bear&amp;quot; he whispered making me blush I&amp;#39;ve never been called that before as I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;10&amp;quot; and about 260lb with a hairy chest and belly (manly hairy not gorilla hairy) and my shaved cock, balls and ass (love being hairless down there). He was amazing about the same height as me at 5&amp;#39;10 around 200lb with a little belly and there it was the best looking cock I had ever seen at 6ish inches with a beautiful thick circumcised head, I stared for a moment and got a devilish grin and pushed him onto the bed dropping to my knees and taking that beautiful head into my mouth, then deeper and deeper until his cock head was down my throat leaving it there and then forcing it down again (I love deep throating)he moaned in pleasure &amp;quot;Oh my God you&amp;#39;re good&amp;quot; I bobbed up and down taking it out of my mouth to slightly stroke while I sucked on his balls and played with his tight hairless hole making him moan even more, a little precum oozed from his cock while I was stroking and I greedily lapped it up it tasted amazing so salty and sweet. I got up from my knees and slid my way back up his body kissing my way to his mouth he kissed me deeply our tongues exploring each others mouth, he started kissing and licking my neck I moaned in ecstasy as his hands slid down my torso to fondle my bald cock n balls I whispered in his ear &amp;quot;suck on my nipples baby&amp;quot; and he obediently did sucking on one and roughly pinching the other sending fireworks through my brain, he then went to work on my cock I&amp;quot;m no porn start for sure I&amp;#39;m only 5&amp;quot; uncircumcised and average thickness but the way he sucked it and worshiped it I felt like John Holmes, I raised my hips grabbed his head and fucked his mouth feeling his tongue twirl around my member as I pumped it in and out, I was in heaven.  I pulled my cock out of his mouth I wanted to explore even more of his beautiful body, I flipped him on his belly and went down to his ass mm god so nice n tight I starting to rim him which he loved, I licked and tongued his tight hole he tasted amazing once he was good and wet I slowly slid my index finger in him, I thought he was going to cum! I slid under neath and took the tip of his cock in my mouth while slowly fingering him until I could get to his prostate his cock twitched in my mouth as I worked his hole, he was really tight I i got up to grab some lube I had just opened the the cap when he pulled me over and pushed me face down onto the bed &amp;quot;your turn now!&amp;quot; I have never had a man or woman lick my hole and only had one other man enter me and he was only a two pump chump so this was so exciting he went to work on my shaved hole like a pro licking sucking tongue fucking it all the while milking my cock. &amp;quot;oh god your amazing baby&amp;quot; I half moaned  face down in the pillow &amp;quot;Fuck me baby I want your cock deep in me!&amp;quot;  he chuckled and pulled a condom off the nigh stand and wrapped up, he spit on my ultra tight hole and pushed in and BOOM! my brain short circuited! WOW it felt so good and also a little bit of pain because I was still ultra tight &amp;quot;ohohohoh gooood&amp;quot; I went to say I need some lube but all that came out was &amp;quot;HARDER!&amp;quot;  He complied and pushed half way in.

I put my hand on the headboard and push with all I can must against him pushing the rest of him in. &amp;quot;uh uh Oh my god!&amp;quot; is all I can muster at this point with his thick throbbing fuck rod all the way in or atleast I thought, He grabs my hips and goes balls deep blowing my mind once more, he slides almost all the way out only leaving his head in and pushed back in at which time I totally did need lube, he squirted a liberal amount on my cunvulsing hole and then pushed all the way back in again &amp;quot;FUCK ME! FUCK ME HARD! I command and he more than willingly does sending me almost unconscious with pleasure my arms go out and I&amp;#39;m biting the pillow he pumps away and then he hits &amp;quot;THE SPOT&amp;quot; BOOM POW WOW! I thought my brain was going to explode right there no one has ever hit my &amp;quot;A spot&amp;quot; and I&amp;#39;ve only done it once with a dildo it was over the top I&amp;#39;m seeing stars point he keeps pumping deeper and harder constantly pushing against my a-spot , it was all just gutteral noises form here on out I was jelly All I could think is fuck me fuck me fuck me I could feel my cock oozing precum and my balls tighten up with ever pump of his ultra stiff member he was amazing he said something but I couldn&amp;#39;t comprehend ever nerve in my body was on edge every synapse in my brain was firing at once the only thing I could hear is tr rhythmic slap slap slap of his balls on my taint as he pumped in and out in and out faster and faster then slower then faster as he tried to keep from blowing his load, I regained a little bit and was able to mutter &amp;quot;cum in me daddy cum in my fuck hole&amp;quot; and he was off fucking like a porn star, as I felt his cock head throb and then Boom! spasm after spasm after spasm of cum from his cock and mine both of us grunting as we emptied our loads his in my ass and mine on the blanket no hand no stimulation of my cock just from his amazing fucking. He slumped onto my back both of us out of breath we layed there for a few minutes then he pulled out of my very well used hole. we cuddled for a few minutes both of us in silence just lightly running our hands over each others sweaty bodies then I broke the with &amp;quot;well looks like I&amp;quot;m a bottom&amp;quot; to which we both laughed and then kissed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After about half an hour we got up cleaned up, dressed and said our goodbyes both knowing that this would happen again and I knowing I definitely love the cock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I had the best sex of my life orgasm-ed anally and know without a shadow of a doubt that I&amp;#39;m bisexual. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BTW three hours later I was still walking around in a euphoric fog\nHope you liked my encounter. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","score":25,"gilded":0,"author_flair_text":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"title":"[m]y first time making love to another [m]an [m/m]","banned_by":null,"subreddit":"gonewildstories","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1413328322,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rvlj","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/144gag/my_first_time_making_love_to_another_man_mm/","created_utc":1354402282,"selftext":"Hey All \nI just created this account because I want to tell my amazing first time I had last night and the first time I let another man have his way with me completely. \nI've known for a long time that I was Bi but have lied to myself (grew up in a religious home), I've had a few same sex encounters but they've been lackluster to say the least not helping my journeys down this road.

I thought my brain was going to explode right there no one has ever hit my \"A spot\" and I've only done it once with a dildo it was over the top I'm seeing stars point he keeps pumping deeper and harder constantly pushing against my a-spot , it was all just gutteral noises form here on out I was jelly All I could think is fuck me fuck me fuck me I could feel my cock oozing precum and my balls tighten up with ever pump of his ultra stiff member he was amazing he said something but I couldn't comprehend ever nerve in my body was on edge every synapse in my brain was firing at once the only thing I could hear is tr rhythmic slap slap slap of his balls on my taint as he pumped in and out in and out faster and faster then slower then faster as he tried to keep from blowing his load, I regained a little bit and was able to mutter \"cum in me daddy cum in my fuck hole\" and he was off fucking like a porn star, as I felt his cock head throb and then Boom! spasm after spasm after spasm of cum from his cock and mine both of us grunting as we emptied our loads his in my ass and mine on the blanket no hand no stimulation of my cock just from his amazing fucking. He slumped onto my back both of us out of breath we layed there for a few minutes then he pulled out of my very well used hole. we cuddled for a few minutes both of us in silence just lightly running our hands over each others sweaty bodies then I broke the with \"well looks like I\"m a bottom\" to which we both laughed and then kissed. \n\nAfter about half an hour we got up cleaned up, dressed and said our goodbyes both knowing that this would happen again and I knowing I definitely love the cock.\n\nTLDR: I had the best sex of my life orgasm-ed anally and know without a shadow of a doubt that I'm bisexual. \n\nBTW three hours later I was still walking around in a euphoric fog\nHope you liked my encounter.

In a nutshell, I grew up poor, tried to go to a college that was too expensive for me when I was 17, got locked into about $16,000 of debt without graduating because of more money problems, and then went to work... doing low-wage jobs. I was a teenager and had never really been taught about finances. I am 25 right now and hindsight is 20/20. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After getting out of my hometown which was in a huge economic slump, I came to NYC in 2007 for better job prospects (and in hopes to return to school).  In 2008 I met my then-future-husband, we became pregnant in 2009, and found out when we tried to get married that he did not have citizenship…IN ANY COUNTRY. He had lived his life thinking he had refugee status when he was actually stateless. There&amp;#39;s no passport, no citizenship, and his parents were born in different disputed territories themselves, one also without citizenship anywhere. He came here as a small child and had no say in any of this. This caused a huge problem in our plans, but we did manage to get married despite the problems. However, it means that essentially his potential for work is limited to jobs with poor wages until everything is straightened out (he has a work permit, but does not have permanent resident status). We are trying to work through it, and $5,000 later we still are looking at possible years before he even has a shot at certain opportunities that could help our family. He is two years away from a Bachelor&amp;#39;s degree, but we can&amp;#39;t afford to pay it out of pocket. I have suggested CLEP for some courses, but even that&amp;#39;s about $120 per test. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that being the case, the bread-winning responsibilities have been placed on me; however, I also did not complete college. So my potential wages are also pretty hard to live on for three people (plus my mother half of the time). We live in New York City, so it means that we cannot afford to live together in our own apartment. We do not qualify for public housing because of my husband’s strange immigration situation. This means that for nearly 3 years, I lived with his family in a 3 bedroom apartment that housed 6 people and a baby. This caused great stress, but I persevered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2011, I returned to school and got a part-time job, and my husband got a $9 an hour full-time job.  At this point, I began going back and forth to my mother’s apartment in a public housing complex in order to study since I could not focus in a seven-person apartment. This means that for several days a week, I am in another part of town in the name of studying, away from family, in the hopes that all of this will pay off in the ability to get a job that will support the three of us. I haven&amp;#39;t had a &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; in years. I have been going to school every fall, spring, and summer since 2011 and I am about a year away from graduation, but in the meantime I feel like I am deteriorating inside. I have had emotional breakdowns a few times at my old jobs (out of view of co-workers) due to this predicament.

I also tried enlisting in the military, but the very student loan debt I incurred to try to get better job prospects is the reason I am disqualified from military service. At least the good news is I am a semester away from an Associate’s degree, so at least I might be able to work for a slightly more decent wage while I complete the Bachelor’s.

Well here's what I think.\n\n 1. I think this notion is generally shallow.  When you and your friend are admiring how the game \"took into account that you had angered character X the previous mission and then she walked away and wouldn't help you for the next mission\" or something like that, you really aren't appreciative of the actual story, gameplay or experience as a whole.  Indeed, your experience was the only one you had, so the fact that other possibilities exist can't intrinsically \"wow\" you.  It's only when you compare it to your friend that you too get amazed.\n\n  Even then though, you're admiring the amount of permutations, not what they led to.  There's usually little discussion on the quality of each branching path, only that the branching paths exist and take into account your decisions.  You're generally just congratulating the developers on having a big spreadsheet in the background, but not what they actually did with it, which leads to\n\n 2.
