But I want to get the most out of it, and if I don't leave the gym feeling tired its not fulfilling in the end. \n\nHeres what I do on day A: \n\nFlat Bench Press 190 pounds 5x5\nDeadlift:180 pounds 5x5 \nChin Ups: Bodyweight 3x8 (I'm still getting these down)\nBodyweight Dips 3x10 \nFarmers walk: 4 laps around the gym, maybe 40 seconds or so walking at a fast pace per lap. \n\nI'll do the dips and the chin ups very rapidly after one another, as I will with the dips and the farmers walks, because it is what I think of as a \"superset\" (something I could very well be corrected on). \n\nThen on Day B: \n\nSquats (Excel [not sure on spelling] squat machine, 380 lbs 5x5 \nClean and Presses 100 lbs Barbell 5x5 \nPullover 70 lbs Barbell 3x8 \nBent Over Rows 50 lbs 5x5 \nFarmers Walk if I'm not too tired. \n\nOne thing I'd like to add is at least some isolation exercises, but that's where I'm clueless, I don't really know where to work them in, or how often I should do them for each muscle group. I'd love to work out my biceps a little more if possible. I'd also be open to the idea of adding an accessory exercise per muscle every workout because it'd make me feel like I'm getting everything I can out of the workout. \n\n\nAs a side question, I would also welcome any advice on supplements. I was thinking about taking something like NO Xplode but If its going to make me gain weight then forget about it, because my entire goal no matter what is to make it down to 205 (from 235). I just like working out not and I want to keep the habit going. \n\nThanks Reddit! \n","domain":"self.Fitness","num_comments":3,"likes":null,"clicked":false,"thumbnail":"self","saved":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhx4","ups":1,"approved_by":null,"score":0,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been going to the gym since April and until just recently (~1 month or so ago) I had been doing almost strictly isolation movements.

We go to the park and listen to music and talk, I kiss her after a couple hours of building myself up (I've never kissed a girl prior to her) and drive her home and ask her if I can drive her to school in the mornings and pick her up after. (she's a senior in hs, I'm a freshman in college)\n\nEverything goes pretty well when I pick her up, we get coffee, I kiss her a couple more times and we keep texting each other throughout the day about how much we like each other and can't wait to see each other etc etc. I pick her up and ask her if she has any plans for the day (we were talking about going to my house and watching a movie that night) and she says she was going to meet a friend downtown.\n\nI'm fine with that and I ask her if she wanted to go chill downtown and wait for him, get some food, maybe check out some atmosphere shops. I don't know my way around downtown so we just drove around for a while before we decided to park and walk around. A couple more quick kisses. I hold her hand a couple times, we laugh at things in the stores, we have decent conversation, everything was going ok at this point. It comes time to meet the friend and she kisses me again in a bookstore we were at. She seemed to think that I was uncomfortable that she was meeting a male friend but I just thought it was a little strange that she wanted me to leave instead of meeting him first then leaving but oh well, it's not a big deal. I kiss her and hug her one last time and drive home. At this point I hadn't said that I wanted her to be my girlfriend yet but we had confessed that we liked each other and had kissed about 6 times, we were planning on watching a movie at my house and that's where I would have advanced our relationship. Well that never happened. I send her this text on my way home.\n\nMe: Hit me up if u need a ride later.\n\nHer: K what u doin?\n\nMe: Taking a shower then I’ll probably have a little siesta I slept like 4 hours lol\n\nHer: Can I join u in the nap? (I wasn't sure if she was serious, I dropped her off 20 minutes ago, I would have rather had her come over that night when I was refreshed and my parents were asleep because they're old fashioned and they would have frowned upon us napping together so early in our relationship)\n\nMe: Haha sure if u come over tonight\n\nHer: Spend the night lol? (The lol? threw me off, I thought I maybe offended her, I know she's DTF, and we had been texting about wanting to be there with the other when they said they were in bed, but I took the lol? as a raised eyebrow)\n\nMe: Lol if u want to 40 minutes pass, she rarely takes that long to reply\n\nHer: Thatd be nice (I felt like I must have offended her because she took so long to reply, I try to take back what I said and suggest that I'm still down at the same time but it comes out wrong)\n\nMe: Cool but listen I wasn’t trying to rush u into anything I thought u meant that literally. Not that I haven’t thought about it ha (She's had sex with at least 4 other guys, I'm a virgin, I just wanted to make sure I didn't make her feel uncomfortable by hinting that I wanted her to sleep over, she wanted to go camping with me earlier that week and she said she wished she was there to \"cuddle me and give me kisses\")\n\nHer: I'm not trying to either its ok hon\n\nMe: I wouldn’t mind at all if u were I just don’t want u thinking that’s all im interested in u for 50 minutes pass after my stupid text, I get paranoid and send another\n\nMe: I love being with u so much you just amaze me everyday :)\n\nHer: Don't even worry honey:)\n\nMe: Okay :)\n\nWe don't text much for the next few hours, I tell her I love an album that she let me borrow, she replies that she loves chilling with me, I say the same, then about 4 hours later (9:30) she asks me if I still want to chill that night. I say yea if she does and she says she does but she's still downtown and the bus doesn't come until 11. I offer to pick her up and she says her friend who lives 30 minutes away needs a ride too, I'm ok with that but there was some confusion like he didn't know how to get there or something and she says its ok they caught a bus. I ask if she wants to chill when she gets back and she said probably not. I get paranoid again.\n\nShe apologizes for making me drive, I don't really text her for the rest of the night, I was really confused so I didn't know what to say. The next day I find pictures on facebook that she was tagged in of her kissing a guy by the same name of her friend wearing the same clothes I saw her in. Now we were never official, I hadn't asked her to be my girlfriend yet, but she knew I liked her a lot and she said she liked me a lot too, but I feel like my text about not wanting to rush her into anything is what convinced her to kiss this guy. I texted her about going to a party with me before I saw the pics and I later told her that it wasn't going to happen because my friends sister won't leave. She replies 9 hours later, at 3:50 am when she knew that the party would have been over and that I was probably asleep, but I wasn't.\n\nHer: Is it bad that she won't leave?\n\nMe: Let's cut the shit. Do u still care about me at all?\n\nHer: Yes what's wrong? (I'm like what the fuck do you think is wrong? Maybe she doesn't know I've seen the pics yet. I don't reply yet.)\n\nHer: I’m sorry I didn’t text you back my dad was supposed to hang out he never did I went to bed early I miss u (I sent her the text at like 7, she wasn't asleep, I doubt her dad was in town)\n\nMe: That’s fine I don’t care about that. I know ur not my gf (I didn’t want to accuse her of cheating and I wanted to sound like I’m used to kisses being meaningless) but I thought we had something.\n\nHer: I know we’re not dating but I do really like u and im afraid if we date something bad will happen and we wont ever talk anymore. (I don't know how to reply so I don't, she sends me another 7 minutes later)\n\nHer: I can’t sleep your on my mind I miss you\n\nMe: Have u felt that way this whole time? (She said she liked me, not because I asked she just told me, I knew she didn't go into this just wanting to be friends)\n\nHer: Yea I’m afraid of something bad happening I always have bad luck with people.\n\nMe: Are u dating michael now? (They had 4 pics of them kissing, that seems like a couple thing) She doesn't reply, I text her 50 minutes later at about 5 am\n\nMe: Right. Its ok I understand. Maybe we work better this way. No reply for another 2 hours, 7 am, I can't sleep\n\nMe: I just feel like u didn’t give me enough time to show u what we could be. I wanted u to come over but u were so hesitant I thought u felt rushed\n\nHer: I’m just afraid of losing u as a friend idk\n\nMe: I’ll always be ur friend kate but there has to be more to it than that. I feel like we had a misunderstanding with the texts on friday.\n\nHer (The next day): I really miss you a lot I can’t stop thinking about you I don't reply\n\nHer (5 hours later): What are you doing?\n\nI get really cold at this point and I barely text her, she tells me like 4 more times that she misses me and can't stop thinking about me, I don't once tell her I miss her or think about her back but I do. I text her a day later and tell her that I want her to know that I'm still glad I met her and I'm not mad. She again says \"I was just thinking about you\" and I know she wants me to say the same or ask why but I don't. She sets her relationship status to In a relationship with Michael, they're official, we haven't talked in a couple days but I ignored a text she sent about wanting to hang out with me and my friend, so the \"conversation ball\" was in my court, I just didn't feel like talking to her.\n\nSo if you've managed to read this all first of all thank you, I have nobody else to talk to and I'm still pretty clueless as to how relationships work. And I'm just left with two questions.\n\nShould I be angry? I feel like my text about not wanting to rush her is what convinced her that I wasn't what she wanted in a boyfriend but I really only said that for her. I wouldn't call what she did cheating since we weren't official but we had kissed, we had said we liked each other, we had went out a couple times, but she decided to kiss him anyway when she knew how I felt about her.\n\nHow should I proceed from here? I still want her. I feel like my text made it seem like I didn't want to have sex with her but I just said that for her benefit. She's very sexually free, I've never even kissed a girl before her, so I can see how that would be a deal breaker. Should I just approach her as a friend and act like I don't care to make her want me? Should I just forget her and move on? I want to at least show her my true personality, I was really off on the second \"date\" because I was so tired and I don't really like it downtown. I just feel like this ended before it really began and if she saw the true me we could have been great. I'm thinking I'm just going to play it off like I think she's right and slowly I'll win her back but am I losing my dignity in the process?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated, I've been thinking about her non-stop and my friends are of no support.\n\ntl;dr: There's too much to summarize, I'm sorry for the wall o' text but this is a very complex situation.

Now we were never official, I hadn&amp;#39;t asked her to be my girlfriend yet, but she knew I liked her a lot and she said she liked me a lot too, but I feel like my text about not wanting to rush her into anything is what convinced her to kiss this guy. I texted her about going to a party with me before I saw the pics and I later told her that it wasn&amp;#39;t going to happen because my friends sister won&amp;#39;t leave. She replies 9 hours later, at 3:50 am when she knew that the party would have been over and that I was probably asleep, but I wasn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: Is it bad that she won&amp;#39;t leave?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Let&amp;#39;s cut the shit. Do u still care about me at all?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: Yes what&amp;#39;s wrong? (I&amp;#39;m like what the fuck do you think is wrong? Maybe she doesn&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;ve seen the pics yet. I don&amp;#39;t reply yet.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: I’m sorry I didn’t text you back my dad was supposed to hang out he never did I went to bed early I miss u (I sent her the text at like 7, she wasn&amp;#39;t asleep, I doubt her dad was in town)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: That’s fine I don’t care about that. I know ur not my gf (I didn’t want to accuse her of cheating and I wanted to sound like I’m used to kisses being meaningless) but I thought we had something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: I know we’re not dating but I do really like u and im afraid if we date something bad will happen and we wont ever talk anymore. (I don&amp;#39;t know how to reply so I don&amp;#39;t, she sends me another 7 minutes later)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: I can’t sleep your on my mind I miss you&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Have u felt that way this whole time? (She said she liked me, not because I asked she just told me, I knew she didn&amp;#39;t go into this just wanting to be friends)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: Yea I’m afraid of something bad happening I always have bad luck with people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Are u dating michael now? (They had 4 pics of them kissing, that seems like a couple thing) She doesn&amp;#39;t reply, I text her 50 minutes later at about 5 am&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Right. Its ok I understand. Maybe we work better this way. No reply for another 2 hours, 7 am, I can&amp;#39;t sleep&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I just feel like u didn’t give me enough time to show u what we could be. I wanted u to come over but u were so hesitant I thought u felt rushed&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: I’m just afraid of losing u as a friend idk&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I’ll always be ur friend kate but there has to be more to it than that. I feel like we had a misunderstanding with the texts on friday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her (The next day): I really miss you a lot I can’t stop thinking about you I don&amp;#39;t reply&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her (5 hours later): What are you doing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get really cold at this point and I barely text her, she tells me like 4 more times that she misses me and can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about me, I don&amp;#39;t once tell her I miss her or think about her back but I do. I text her a day later and tell her that I want her to know that I&amp;#39;m still glad I met her and I&amp;#39;m not mad. She again says &amp;quot;I was just thinking about you&amp;quot; and I know she wants me to say the same or ask why but I don&amp;#39;t. She sets her relationship status to In a relationship with Michael, they&amp;#39;re official, we haven&amp;#39;t talked in a couple days but I ignored a text she sent about wanting to hang out with me and my friend, so the &amp;quot;conversation ball&amp;quot; was in my court, I just didn&amp;#39;t feel like talking to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;ve managed to read this all first of all thank you, I have nobody else to talk to and I&amp;#39;m still pretty clueless as to how relationships work. And I&amp;#39;m just left with two questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should I be angry? I feel like my text about not wanting to rush her is what convinced her that I wasn&amp;#39;t what she wanted in a boyfriend but I really only said that for her. I wouldn&amp;#39;t call what she did cheating since we weren&amp;#39;t official but we had kissed, we had said we liked each other, we had went out a couple times, but she decided to kiss him anyway when she knew how I felt about her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How should I proceed from here? I still want her. I feel like my text made it seem like I didn&amp;#39;t want to have sex with her but I just said that for her benefit. She&amp;#39;s very sexually free, I&amp;#39;ve never even kissed a girl before her, so I can see how that would be a deal breaker. Should I just approach her as a friend and act like I don&amp;#39;t care to make her want me? Should I just forget her and move on? I want to at least show her my true personality, I was really off on the second &amp;quot;date&amp;quot; because I was so tired and I don&amp;#39;t really like it downtown. I just feel like this ended before it really began and if she saw the true me we could have been great. I&amp;#39;m thinking I&amp;#39;m just going to play it off like I think she&amp;#39;s right and slowly I&amp;#39;ll win her back but am I losing my dignity in the process?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any help is greatly appreciated, I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about her non-stop and my friends are of no support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: There&amp;#39;s too much to summarize, I&amp;#39;m sorry for the wall o&amp;#39; text but this is a very complex situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1317514501,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

We go to the park and listen to music and talk, I kiss her after a couple hours of building myself up (I've never kissed a girl prior to her) and drive her home and ask her if I can drive her to school in the mornings and pick her up after. (she's a senior in hs, I'm a freshman in college)\n\n Everything goes pretty well when I pick her up, we get coffee, I kiss her a couple more times and we keep texting each other throughout the day about how much we like each other and can't wait to see each other etc etc. I pick her up and ask her if she has any plans for the day (we were talking about going to my house and watching a movie that night) and she says she was going to meet a friend downtown.\n\n I'm fine with that and I ask her if she wanted to go chill downtown and wait for him, get some food, maybe check out some atmosphere shops. I don't know my way around downtown so we just drove around for a while before we decided to park and walk around. A couple more quick kisses. I hold her hand a couple times, we laugh at things in the stores, we have decent conversation, everything was going ok at this point. It comes time to meet the friend and she kisses me again in a bookstore we were at. She seemed to think that I was uncomfortable that she was meeting a male friend but I just thought it was a little strange that she wanted me to leave instead of meeting him first then leaving but oh well, it's not a big deal. I kiss her and hug her one last time and drive home. At this point I hadn't said that I wanted her to be my girlfriend yet but we had confessed that we liked each other and had kissed about 6 times, we were planning on watching a movie at my house and that's where I would have advanced our relationship. Well that never happened. I send her this text on my way home.\n\nMe: Hit me up if u need a ride later.\n\nHer: K what u doin?\n\nMe: Taking a shower then I’ll probably have a little siesta I slept like 4 hours lol\n\nHer: Can I join u in the nap? (I wasn't sure if she was serious, I dropped her off 20 minutes ago, I would have rather had her come over that night when I was refreshed and my parents were asleep because they're old fashioned and they would have frowned upon us napping together so early in our relationship)\n\nMe: Haha sure if u come over tonight\n\nHer: Spend the night lol? (The lol? threw me off, I thought I maybe offended her, I know she's DTF, and we had been texting about wanting to be there with the other when they said they were in bed, but I took the lol? as a raised eyebrow)\n\nMe: Lol if u want to\n*40 minutes pass, she rarely takes that long to reply*\n\nHer: Thatd be nice\n(I felt like I must have offended her because she took so long to reply, I try to take back what I said and suggest that I'm still down at the same time but it comes out wrong)\n\nMe: Cool but listen I wasn’t trying to rush u into anything I thought u meant that literally. Not that I haven’t thought about it ha (She's had sex with at least 4 other guys, I'm a virgin, I just wanted to make sure I didn't make her feel uncomfortable by hinting that I wanted her to sleep over, she wanted to go camping with me earlier that week and she said she wished she was there to \"cuddle me and give me kisses\")\n\nHer: I'm not trying to either its ok hon\n\nMe: I wouldn’t mind at all if u were I just don’t want u thinking that’s all im interested in u for\n*50 minutes pass after my stupid text, I get paranoid and send another*\n\nMe: I love being with u so much you just amaze me everyday :)\n\nHer: Don't even worry honey:)\n\nMe: Okay :)\n\nWe don't text much for the next few hours, I tell her I love an album that she let me borrow, she replies that she loves chilling with me, I say the same, then about 4 hours later (9:30) she asks me if I still want to chill that night. I say yea if she does and she says she does but she's still downtown and the bus doesn't come until 11. I offer to pick her up and she says her friend who lives 30 minutes away needs a ride too, I'm ok with that but there was some confusion like he didn't know how to get there or something and she says its ok they caught a bus.

I wanted u to come over but u were so hesitant I thought u felt rushed&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: I’m just afraid of losing u as a friend idk&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I’ll always be ur friend kate but there has to be more to it than that. I feel like we had a misunderstanding with the texts on friday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her (The next day): I really miss you a lot I can’t stop thinking about you\n&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;#39;t reply&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her (5 hours later): What are you doing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get really cold at this point and I barely text her, she tells me like 4 more times that she misses me and can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about me, I don&amp;#39;t once tell her I miss her or think about her back but I do. I text her a day later and tell her that I want her to know that I&amp;#39;m still glad I met her and I&amp;#39;m not mad. She again says &amp;quot;I was just thinking about you&amp;quot; and I know she wants me to say the same or ask why but I don&amp;#39;t. She sets her relationship status to In a relationship with Michael, they&amp;#39;re official, we haven&amp;#39;t talked in a couple days but I ignored a text she sent about wanting to hang out with me and my friend, so the &amp;quot;conversation ball&amp;quot; was in my court, I just didn&amp;#39;t feel like talking to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;ve managed to read this all first of all thank you, I have nobody else to talk to and I&amp;#39;m still pretty clueless as to how relationships work. And I&amp;#39;m just left with two questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Should I be angry?&lt;/em&gt; I feel like my text about not wanting to rush her is what convinced her that I wasn&amp;#39;t what she wanted in a boyfriend but I really only said that for her. I wouldn&amp;#39;t call what she did cheating since we weren&amp;#39;t official but we had kissed, we had said we liked each other, we had went out a couple times, but she decided to kiss him anyway when she knew how I felt about her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How should I proceed from here?&lt;/em&gt; I still want her. I feel like my text made it seem like I didn&amp;#39;t want to have sex with her but I just said that for her benefit. She&amp;#39;s very sexually free, I&amp;#39;ve never even kissed a girl before her, so I can see how that would be a deal breaker. Should I just approach her as a friend and act like I don&amp;#39;t care to make her want me? Should I just forget her and move on? I want to at least show her my true personality, I was really off on the second &amp;quot;date&amp;quot; because I was so tired and I don&amp;#39;t really like it downtown. I just feel like this ended before it really began and if she saw the true me we could have been great. I&amp;#39;m thinking I&amp;#39;m just going to play it off like I think she&amp;#39;s right and slowly I&amp;#39;ll win her back but am I losing my dignity in the process?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any help is greatly appreciated, I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about her non-stop and my friends are of no support. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1317513558,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

I thought about some meet ups but I hear most of them are mostly for college students. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am reaching out to the fine people in &lt;a href=\"/r/chicago\"&gt;/r/chicago&lt;/a&gt; hoping to get some good suggestions from the community on some ways, places or ideas to meet up with people I may get along with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve lurked for a couple weeks hoping to find a post that coud help to no avail so hopefully this could also help others in a similar position.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1317511526,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

I've been gaming online since I was 8 years old (I'm 23 now) and have been somewhat of a gaming geek since then. One **truth** I've learned over these years is about the *host advantage*.\n\nBasically, NHL 12 and most other online console games use a P2P connection (also known as client-side hosting). In the simplest terms this means that when you play a versus game (or any other game mode) one player is assigned to be the connection host. All the information and actions in the game are registered on that player's console. If you are not the host, every action you make is sent via the internet to the host's console; it applies those actions to the game and then sends back the reactions. Your console is sending millions of data packets to the host's console every second, and the host's console is sending data packets back to you as well.\n\nThe transfer of data from one console to another is what creates \"lag\". All actions need to be sent to the host's console to be applied to the current game. This means that the host has no lag; all the actions he makes are immediately registered on his console. His actions receive an immediate and accurate response while others are dependent on the internet connection to send and receive data.\n\nThe game picks a user to host without showing who it picked; which is why many people are completely unaware of a host advantage. It most likely picks the user with the most suitable connection to host; however this I am not certain of. The biggest three factors influencing host advantage are the speed of both users' connections, the reliability (making sure no data is lost) of both connections, and the distance between the two (or more) players.\n\nThe player with the host connection will always have the advantage; the size of that advantage depends on the three factors mentioned above. Sometimes a match-up can be pretty even given both players have great connections and live close to each other. Other times, one player will be severely crippled in how the game plays out.\n\nSome symptoms of host advantage (assuming you're not the host):\n\n- Your team cannot hold onto the puck; you lose the puck when simply skating near an opponent\n\n- You cannot separate an opponent from the puck (poking, stick-lifting, hitting, etc); anytime a puck is separated it goes right back to the opponent\n\n- Your players feel sluggish and unresponsive\n\n- The opponent skates through your defense without any trouble\n\n- The game basically feels like it took a bribe from your opponent\n\nThe game that you see and play on your screen is a split-second behind what is actually going on. If you try and line up a check, you are probably lining up where your opponent was just under a second ago. The host, however, sees and plays the game in real-time. The more the advantage for the host, the further behind the opponent.\n\nOn the flip-side, you are most likely the host if you see your opponent suffering from these symptoms, but you seem to be dominating.\n\nHere's a video showing what I'm talking about. I know, it's Call of Duty; however it uses the same connection (P2P) and shows the same type of lag experienced in NHL 12 (and any other P2P game).\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRtdHmXEjs\n\nThoughts/comments/criticisms welcome!\n\n\n\n--*edit*--\n\nForgot to mention that when you connect to EA servers, you are simply connecting to their database. The EA servers store all your statistics/records.

I&amp;#39;ve been gaming online since I was 8 years old (I&amp;#39;m 23 now) and have been somewhat of a gaming geek since then. One &lt;strong&gt;truth&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ve learned over these years is about the &lt;em&gt;host advantage&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, NHL 12 and most other online console games use a P2P connection (also known as client-side hosting). In the simplest terms this means that when you play a versus game (or any other game mode) one player is assigned to be the connection host. All the information and actions in the game are registered on that player&amp;#39;s console. If you are not the host, every action you make is sent via the internet to the host&amp;#39;s console; it applies those actions to the game and then sends back the reactions. Your console is sending millions of data packets to the host&amp;#39;s console every second, and the host&amp;#39;s console is sending data packets back to you as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The transfer of data from one console to another is what creates &amp;quot;lag&amp;quot;. All actions need to be sent to the host&amp;#39;s console to be applied to the current game. This means that the host has no lag; all the actions he makes are immediately registered on his console. His actions receive an immediate and accurate response while others are dependent on the internet connection to send and receive data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game picks a user to host without showing who it picked; which is why many people are completely unaware of a host advantage. It most likely picks the user with the most suitable connection to host; however this I am not certain of. The biggest three factors influencing host advantage are the speed of both users&amp;#39; connections, the reliability (making sure no data is lost) of both connections, and the distance between the two (or more) players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The player with the host connection will always have the advantage; the size of that advantage depends on the three factors mentioned above.

The application required me to give my employment history and financial information (assets, expenses, income, etc.) After standing in line for 45 mins, I handed the application to the clerk. She reviews it and quickly hands it back. She tells me that I need to fill out my parents financial info and make a note of it on the side of the box. The following encounter took place:\n\n* **Me:** Why do you need my parents information? I'm 19 years old.\n\n* **Clerk:** Are your parents supporting you in court?\n\n* **Me:** Not directly, do you see them here? I'm an adult.\n\n* **Clerk:** I cannot accept this without your parents information\n\n* **Me:** Where on this application does it say that? Show me this rule in text.\n\n* **Clerk:** I do this every day, I'm telling you that your parents income needs to be on this application or I'm \nnot taking it.\n\n* **Me:** Did you write the application yourself?\n\n* **Clerk:** (flustered) If you give me this application as it is, I will call you in an hour and tell you it has been declined, and you will have to come back to fill out a new one with your parents information. Don't make this harder on yourself.\n\n* **Me:** Who are you? Do you approve/decline these applications?\n\n* **Clerk:** I'm not taking that, if you give it to me like that I'm throwing it out. ~calls next person in line as I'm standing in front of her~\n\n* **Me:** Wait, you're denying my civil right to apply for a public attorney. This woman is violating my rights in court (to others in line)\n\n* **Clerk:** (ignoring me deals with the next person in line)\n\nI waited for her to finish then stepped to the window again.

Pull up a seat. They comment at how I had a shot, and I tell them not to think of me as an alcoholic, because they go to meetings, also how alcoholics drink alone, but now I have you two to drink with.\n\nSo HB8 sits right next to me, UG next to her. They order a beer. So we start chatting each other up. Here are some of the highlights that stick out.\n\n* They asked me what I do for a living and I tell them I get field reports on what people would actually do for a Klondike Bar (saw that one here, thanks for that). They don't believe me of course, but they play along. \"What kind of things do they usually do?\" \"Sometimes simple things like stand on one leg, give me a kiss on the cheek, I had one guy run across a busy street with his eyes closed, but I never got his signature....(making an oops face). They got a kick out of this and it came up a few times throughout the rest of the night. \n\n* When I ask about what they do, I found out there both early ed teachers and how they graduated from the University down the block that I also go to. While talking about how I'm still in school they ask me how old I am (I'm probably a year younger than them). I tell them I'm 70 years old, but I have that Benjamin Button disease. They ask me what a couple of questions about my past, how was Vietnam, ect. When they ask, no really, I make them guess, price is right style to see who wins.\n\n* I ask them what there plans are for the night, there just hanging out having fun. I ask if its a shot kind of night, and then ask the bartender if he knows the chocolate pretzel (fun shot, lick salt off hand, drink type). I order 3 shots for us (not sure if buying drinks is a good idea or not in this situation. But this was after awhile of talking and getting to know each other). Taking the shot, I quoted How I Met Your Mother(To one hell of a night!), they didn't catch it so I asked if they watch it. HB8 does, and she and I start talking about the show, I tease her about how she is behind. The topic goes to other tv shows, and UG becomes part of the convo again. \n\nSo its getting close to 11, convo is winding down, so i get my check and one last beer. Excuse myself to the restroom. When I come back I finish my beer and tell them how it was nice meeting, but I'm going to headdown to the other bar. I asked for their numbers earlier, only UG gave me hers, but I didn't press HB for hers earlier, so I try again. Tell her she should grab that pen on the bar and write her number on my hand that I offer. She rights Boobies instead. Great. \n\nSo I leave, head to the bar, nothing going on there really, girls never show. I texted UG saying how good call they didnt go, nothing was happened. She texted me awhile ago saying sorry for not coming out/getting a hold of you. I haven't responded yet.\n\nSo thats my FR and I have a few questions and comments of things I should have done.\n\nI thought I was kinoing to HB well, saw a few IOIs by both girls (playing with hair, adjusting cleavage), but HB wasn't being as talkative as UG, so I think HB took it as me being into UG and was trying to not muffblock. I should have called HB out on being quiet I think. How do I focus the convo between HB and I, and keep UG from playing as large of a role? UG was def enjoying my presence. If I see this, should I back off and leave them be? I think not, I should still show myself to be a fun guy.\n\nBuying the shots, good idea or not?\n\nI should have found out if they were single. Something like \"oh girls night out, leaving the bf's at home huh?\"\n\nI think I would have been better off leaving my number for the two of them, since I was the minority, rather then chase both of there numbers.\n\nDo I have any moves next?

Pull up a seat. They comment at how I had a shot, and I tell them not to think of me as an alcoholic, because they go to meetings, also how alcoholics drink alone, but now I have you two to drink with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So HB8 sits right next to me, UG next to her. They order a beer. So we start chatting each other up. Here are some of the highlights that stick out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They asked me what I do for a living and I tell them I get field reports on what people would actually do for a Klondike Bar (saw that one here, thanks for that). They don&amp;#39;t believe me of course, but they play along. &amp;quot;What kind of things do they usually do?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Sometimes simple things like stand on one leg, give me a kiss on the cheek, I had one guy run across a busy street with his eyes closed, but I never got his signature....(making an oops face). They got a kick out of this and it came up a few times throughout the rest of the night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I ask about what they do, I found out there both early ed teachers and how they graduated from the University down the block that I also go to. While talking about how I&amp;#39;m still in school they ask me how old I am (I&amp;#39;m probably a year younger than them). I tell them I&amp;#39;m 70 years old, but I have that Benjamin Button disease. They ask me what a couple of questions about my past, how was Vietnam, ect. When they ask, no really, I make them guess, price is right style to see who wins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ask them what there plans are for the night, there just hanging out having fun. I ask if its a shot kind of night, and then ask the bartender if he knows the chocolate pretzel (fun shot, lick salt off hand, drink type). I order 3 shots for us (not sure if buying drinks is a good idea or not in this situation. But this was after awhile of talking and getting to know each other). Taking the shot, I quoted How I Met Your Mother(To one hell of a night!), they didn&amp;#39;t catch it so I asked if they watch it. HB8 does, and she and I start talking about the show, I tease her about how she is behind. The topic goes to other tv shows, and UG becomes part of the convo again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So its getting close to 11, convo is winding down, so i get my check and one last beer. Excuse myself to the restroom. When I come back I finish my beer and tell them how it was nice meeting, but I&amp;#39;m going to headdown to the other bar. I asked for their numbers earlier, only UG gave me hers, but I didn&amp;#39;t press HB for hers earlier, so I try again. Tell her she should grab that pen on the bar and write her number on my hand that I offer. She rights Boobies instead. Great. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I leave, head to the bar, nothing going on there really, girls never show. I texted UG saying how good call they didnt go, nothing was happened. She texted me awhile ago saying sorry for not coming out/getting a hold of you. I haven&amp;#39;t responded yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So thats my FR and I have a few questions and comments of things I should have done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought I was kinoing to HB well, saw a few IOIs by both girls (playing with hair, adjusting cleavage), but HB wasn&amp;#39;t being as talkative as UG, so I think HB took it as me being into UG and was trying to not muffblock. I should have called HB out on being quiet I think. How do I focus the convo between HB and I, and keep UG from playing as large of a role? UG was def enjoying my presence. If I see this, should I back off and leave them be? I think not, I should still show myself to be a fun guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buying the shots, good idea or not?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should have found out if they were single. Something like &amp;quot;oh girls night out, leaving the bf&amp;#39;s at home huh?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think I would have been better off leaving my number for the two of them, since I was the minority, rather then chase both of there numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I have any moves next? I mentioned a sporting even going on tonight to them, I&amp;#39;m not sure if inviting them over to my place to watch it with a few friends of mine is a good idea or not.

I'm aware things could be worse, that's not really the advice I'm looking for. But I guess for someone my age, it's just the hardest thing I've gone through so far. I am in no way trying to downplay anyone else's plights. \n\n\nBackground story:\n\nIn late 2010, I came out of a 2 and a half year serious relationship, and that really set things off. Months before that I was becoming very stressed out, *very* easily, and was having mental breakdowns a few times a week where I would just cry and cry and wonder why the fuck everything was becoming so stressful all at once. That didn't aid in the break up, however. After the break up, I slipped into months of severe depression where going out with my friends just wasn't an option, and unfortunately neither was attending school regularly. I still feel bad about it, as my mom and dad pay for me to go to school and I would mentally beat myself up because I didn't have the energy nor the will to get out of bed in the morning. I skipped a *lot* of classes, managed to get passing grades though. I changed my major a few times, and now I don't have one. I'm simply getting an associates, and I have no idea what to do next. Then came about 15-20 or so pounds of weight gain, which made me feel even worse about myself because I had lost 50 pounds as a teenager. This was a severe set back for me, and I felt like an absolute failure for letting myself crawl back to the start. I tried my luck at new relationships, but truth was I was just filling a void, and it was painful to do. I ended up in a relationship with someone who absolutely no sense of understanding my ever-worsening depression. Ironically, he had depression himself. He just decided that he didn't have the time to listen to my problems or talk about them, he had to worry only about himself and that he felt he needed someone more emotionally stable.\nI wasn't sure I'd be able to afford therapy before, because my insurance only covered 3 sessions (Apparently they think 3 sessions is totally enough time for you to figure your shit out), and I wasn't sure how much the copay would be otherwise. It ended up being $25 a session, which I could afford with the new job I'm going to mention shortly. I had never been to therapy before, but I have to say that I didn't realize how much talking out my issues to really understand them would help me. My therapist was very down to earth, and had some truly wise things to say. I would go every Tuesday for 50 minutes, and at least temporarily feel like I was going to be okay.\n\nI got the courage to leave the job I hated that gave me barely any hours, and I'd say for almost a year, the one good thing in my life was the fact that my new job paid pretty well and I didn't hate it. Depression still ruled much of my life, but I was making money, and money was okay for temporary comfort. I finally could start saving for a new car, and for other important things. I never had much in the savings account but it was a start.\nHowever in May of 2011, after an awful morning at work where I physically got hurt stocking some stuff and had dealt with pushy customers, our store had an undercover tobacco sting where they send in an underage kid to buy cigarettes. You deny the kid, you pass. I had done one of these things in November and passed with flying colors. But on this day, I was drained, I wasn't thinking, and I didn't card the girl (who looked about 25, she *certainly* didn't look 16--usually they send in kids who are so obviously underage). As soon as the cop came in the doors, my throat tightened up and I knew I was fucked. I lost my job, per policy, and had to pay a fine and got 6 months court supervision. I've never even been pulled over, no tickets, no offenses. Then came the announcement that my parents' divorce was being finalized, and my mother moved to a townhouse about 10 minutes away with my dog that I had a hard time sleeping without. In the couple months I was unemployed, I managed to burn through $700 in savings for shit I don't even really remember. I stopped going to therapy because then I couldn't even afford the $25 copay. My therapist was sad to see me go, especially after I dumped everything that happened on her at our last session. She could see how physically exhausted I was. I have about $375 in savings now, which will do absolutely nothing for me when my car craps out, which it will do in the next year, most likely. I have never been suicidal to the point that I planned it out, but I distinctly remember feeling so utterly lost and ashamed that I couldn't think of any other way out except simply not existing. I just didn't see things coming around at all. I didn't want to tell anyone this, I have trouble even admitting any of this to my close friends, let alone my boyfriend. I don't want him to get scared and run away. I didn't want to end up in some hospital because people thought I was going to do it, or that I was absolutely off my rocker. Any sort of treatment scares the absolute hell out of me, and it I battled frequently with myself to not be an emotional wreck like my mother (who is bipolar, manic depressive). Though I guess I already am?\n\n\nI have a new job now, but it is not what I thought and I am scared that I will need a new car sooner than I thought. I can't afford to go back to therapy, still. I did get into a new relationship that is actually helping me perk up quite a bit, and I could never ask for a better boyfriend (who is a fellow Reddit user!). However, I cannot help but feel like I still have absolutely no direction for myself. Like I mentioned before, I have no career plans. I'm having a terrible time figuring out what I want to do with my life. I would try out majors and think I'd be successful in them, but then decide I wouldn't be, that I just wasn't cut out for any of it. Right now, my plan is to graduate in December and work in the spring until I figure out what to do with myself.\n\n\n\nI guess I'm just really looking to talk to some people who have been in a similar position. I just don't know how to manage my depression while trying not to beat myself up over being at a complete roadblock. I'm 20 years old, I shouldn't feel like time is running out..but that's how I feel.

I'm busting my ass to make $8.50 an hour, and I can't stand that. \n\nAre there any jobs that would be better pay, without requiring a degree/years of experience in the field? In a few months, I plan on getting certified as a personal trainer, so I know there's at least one. The reason why I'm waiting though is because I'm not in the best shape right now, so I'm waiting until I get down to single digit body fat. Even though I'm pretty knowledgeable about working out/nutrition, I still feel like I should be in great shape before I start giving advice to people.\n\nMy friend is studying to become a realtor, and I thought that was silly until he told me that for each house he sells, he makes as much money as he would for 6 months of work at his current job. \n\nI was actually thinking of applying to be a cop/state trooper in the meantime, but the only thing that stopped me was I realized there's no way I'd pass the polygraph. I smoked weed about a month ago, and I'm a terrible liar. I'd probably pass a urine test (Definitely not a hair test), but I'd have to admit to smoking recently, and I'm 99.99% sure they wouldn't appreciate that. Right?\n\nAny ideas? I consider myself to be pretty intelligent, so I'm okay with going to class or taking a test, or what not. I just don't want to be stuck working in retail, especially with the holidays coming up. Dear God, that's going to be awful. \n\ntl;dr Any decent paying jobs that don't require college degree?

Partner and I were the first ones (which I tend to prefer). I get up there, start reading off my part (it wasn't much, total of like 6 sentences). I was doing OK I thought but all of a sudden it fucking happened...got extremely nervous, towards the end everything turns into a blur and I'm not even sure what I said. Didn't read everything.

Every one else does their bit and no one breaks down at all like me. They look calm and at peace with themselves for the most part, many have fun with it even. They're confident. I feel even worse. You know the feeling? Wishing you could do that too? Making it look easy?\n\nAfter class I go speak to the teacher at her office to see if she might have any advice for me (I thought she had mentioned in the first class having resources for anxiety, I was wrong. SA ruins my focus during class and I can't pay attention well). I tell her of my SA, and start fucking shedding tears. I just wanted to get it out there, hoping she might of dealt with this before and could help me somehow. I kept struggling to hold back tears, she was nice and helpful. Asked if I was getting treatment, I said no. She suggested I exercise and some other things. After we're done talking I get out of her office to the nearest bathroom and start fucking sobbing. 29 year old man sobbing. Wondering what I'm doing here, and if this was real. I felt the release of my \"dirty secret\" being out now that the class saw me freak (and I'll be with mostly the same people for the next 2.5 years, which makes me more nervous). I felt the tremendous burden of trying to hide this stuff from people over the years, and the impact it has had on my life in general. Went through many feelings/emotions. I might have a family by now, and be who knows what if it weren't for SA. \n\nAnyways, looking to start seeing a therapist/psychiatrist again (insurance sucks and don't have much money, so that will be tough). I've taken Klonoppin before which wasn't great, Xanax was alright. Any good recommendations? I've heard of beta blockers being good. I know we're all different and react differently to different meds, and the best person for advice is the psychiatrist, but just wondering. Any other advice?

How big is their stick? (not their dicks you guys, you&amp;#39;re redditors, you should a bit more appropriate than that, i know SOME of you would comment on that)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which side should i be on? I am all for human rights. I feel that the human race should live as one organism in peace with each other, doing things only with the idea in mind that others will benefit, but I don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s right here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are Americans, we showed the world what its like to be the best, are we truly demonstrating that now? is the 99% demonstrating that? is the 1% demonstrating that? or is anyone demonstrating that anymore?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d really like some help on this because i only want was is best for everyone. ALL 100% OF YOU. The human race is why i live, because i love you, please take some time to truly question your ideas, morals, and motivations, if we don&amp;#39;t, we could lose everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is something i would love to see on the front page, because i want to see people be intelligent about their decisions and be accountable for their actions, we CAN become better by using metacognition and introspection. PLEASE UPVOTE IF YOU AGREE WITH ME.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1317481667,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

It's been a tough few days, hasn't gotten a whole lot better (don't expect it to), and I'm sticking to not reaching out to her, talking to her, seeing her so far. She did text me this morning to tell me she's thinking about me and hopes I'm okay, I'm probably going to respond eventually with some bland response.\n\nSome of my close friends who know the situation well think she's a selfish, manipulative, immature, awful bitch and I'll be well rid of her because the issues she has would always plague us for the rest of our lives. But others think this time alone she's taking could lead to growth that could lead us back together. Intellectually, I'm not counting on the latter, but, I have to be honest, emotionally I'm hoping for it against all hope (but I will try my best to get out, date, etc. and see what happens).\n\n\nContext: I'm 30, live in NYC. My fiancee (i guess ex-fiancee) and I live together, but she spends most weeks right now a short distance away on a fellowship during the school year (last year, this year, and then done) to the point that she sublets a place out there. So, the first 2 years we were with each other pretty much all the time, and then last Sept - May it is was a mostly-weekends thing (with the exception of a ton of time together during holidays), and that was starting up again right now after being together for all of the summer.\n\nShe had made some vague suggestions earlier this summer that she was \"freaking out\" about getting married next summer, mostly because she wasn't sure what she wants in her professional life short-term, long-term, etc. and was having a hard time thinking about the wedding. She also wanted to spend a few days with friends, away from me, to get perspective. She came back from that and things were pretty good/normal, and she said we didn't need to talk about postponing the wedding. However, we did agree to not discuss/plan the wedding at all in the month of September -- wanted to give her time to focus on a few stressful things arising at work (including future job offers) in September and not have to focus on the craziness of wedding planning.\n\nSo, I was anxious, but waited. We agreed that we'd talk on 10/01 about how to proceed with the wedding plans.\n\nAll of September, things were pretty great. She was handling her work better than ever, and the huge stress on her went away when a job offer for next year came though, and we immediately agreed to take the job -- it's 1,000 miles away -- so we'd be moving together in a year. We both talked about how excited we were about this.\n\nAlthough we were apart Mon-Thu throughout Sept, we had our whole weekends together. No fights. Tons of affection and love. I eagerly/anxiously awaited our October conversation about wedding planning, but mostly felt like things would be fine, worse case would be postponement. \n\nThen, last night, she abruptly asked me to come home (she had just gotten back into town) to meet her. This felt ominous (also, throughout the day she was very distant and not very cheerful via e-mail / txt -- also ominous).\n\nBut, I figured she had some stressful day or something happened with a friend, or maybe she was upset about something with me that could be dealt with. Worse case, I thought she was going to say \"let's postpone the wedding\", which I could handle.\n\nShe cried and apologized and said she loves me, but she can't do this right now. Which turns out to mean \"be engaged to me\" or even be in a relationship with me right now. She said stuff about being stressed out about her life and confused about what she wants and she's still at an age where she's worried she's rushing into things and not thinking what will make her happiest in the long term. Of course she says I have been and am great to her and she loves me so much, and this isn't about me or some other guy or anything.\n\nAnd, of course, she says she hopes we get back together when she figures things out, citing friends of ours who broke up for a while, got back together, and ended up married. But she told me I shouldn't wait for her, and that I deserve to be happy and I should find someone else. I of course told her I didn't want anyone else and I would be alone, miserable, and waiting, but I didn't expect her to come back -- I told her that she'll either be dating someone new soon or she'll move in a year, and that'll be that. She said it wouldn't be like that.\n\nSo many thoughts in my head. We share this apartment together. We have pets together. We combined all of our stuff, and I got rid of most of mine when we combined. She's just gonna live at her sublet full-time, and I have to be in this apartment -- our apartment -- with all of her stuff. For what? To wait for her to come back, which is almost definitely not gonna happen?\n\nShe was/is everything to me and all of my happiness comes from being with her. I'm so fucking shocked and miserable and don't know what the fuck happened. I was so happy with her. She was with me. As recently as this week we had some awesome romantic moments.\n\nWhen she made it clear she couldn't be \"engaged\" (or in a relationship) and wear the ring right now, I asked for the ring back.\n\nShould I sell the ring? I could definitely use the money.\n\nWill she come back? How the hell am I supposed to deal with that remote prospect?\n\nIs there anything you can say to me to make me feel any better? I'm losing my mind, crying my face off, and have no idea how I'll feel any better.

We have been together for nearly three years, and ~2.3 years of this time has been long distance( 2000 miles) because of us going to different Unis. I moved up to where he goes to school last month, and plan on going to his Uni in Jan. I am very excited about the School, so this move was more like something I was going to do eventually and he speed-ed it up a bit rather than a move solely for him in a complete disregard to my education. Adjusting to this area on the other hand has been very difficult, but slowly I am moving past these difficulties and bettering myself.\n\nSadly, my relationship's problems was not solved by me moving. We figured this was going to happen, so we have been seeing a consular since I came up here at least. That is going well. What did not go well was last Thursday. I went to his dorm to spend the night, cook dinner dinner, and study physics in that reverse order. Dinner failed because his stove is broken, so I ended up eating microwaved broccoli instead of making him a pasta dish. Physics studying failed because I was not taking it seriously enough which angered him. Even so, I kept on a happy face and we went to bed to cuddle and talk instead of argue about how he needs to get his stove fixed and how he should realize I can make my own decisions with school.\n\nWhile in bed he got a bit depressed though since we had planned a happy night that did not come to be. I tried to cheer him up, but all the stress of moving, school, and work got the best of me so I began to rant to him. I did not raise my voice, rather I listed everything I need to get done for the weekend (request this transcript for Uni, sign up for the JLPT, get more hours at work, make friends, semi-translate this Islamic book for a friend, cook, laundry, grocery shopping etc). He got even more upset by me being upset, but then tried to cheer me up by telling me how a video game franchise I enjoy is being revamped. This game means a lot to me, so I began to text all my friends about it plus status update ala Facebook and Google+. He asked me to stop. I told him it'd only take 2 minutes, plus I was in bed with my smartphone-not on the PC. He didn't like this and got very upset. I told him I can't take his depression, and he really shouldn't be getting so upset as it's not making me happy-rather it's making my list of things I need to do crush down on me instead of encourage me (oh no I'm gunna fail JLPT, such a waste to sign up vs YAY I can show everyone I know Japanese with a fancy certificate :3). By then I had put my phone down, but I wanted to leave the room as the environment was stifling and I felt it was silly to go to sleep at 9pm (why can't we watch a movie in the living room, go for a walk around campus, do anything!!!). I told him he needs to fight through the depression like I do, and then I got up to leave the bed and the room.\nHe grabs my arms and refuses to let me leave. I think it's a joke so I slide my legs which are not in his grasp off the bed and try to stand up. His nails are digging into my skin. He is very upset now. I tell him I can't deal with this, and to let me go-you're hurting me. He doesn't. I keep on yanking as him until he finally loses grip. I move about 3 feet to the door and he grabs me again. He's raising his voice. He's asking me why can't I comfort him, why can't I do this. I can't deal with this. He's needy and grossing me out. I pull and pull, and get free again as he started to cry. I grab my headscarf. He grabs the scarf out of my hands and grabs me again. I keep on trying to pull away, but he will not let go. It's hurting so much. I do not want to give in to him, and I tell him this. He needs to fight through his depression, I can't deal with him. I keep on saying, \"Please let me go into the living room, please let me go, you need some time alone. I'll be back in an hour, ok?\"\n\nEventually I do give in, he lets me go, and I begin to hold and kiss him. For all of our relationship he has more or less banished me when he gets upset. He has never been clingy. When we fought while long distance he would hang up the phone and not call me for hours, and sometimes days- he needed his alone time he said. I just.. I don't understand. He's so gross to me now.\n\nI want to know if I should be cautious around him cause I'm unsure if this is a red flag towards future abuse. I have been beaten by my ex bfs (no grey area, they kicked my back while I was crawled up on a ball on the floor), and do NOT want that to happen again. I hope this made some sense.\n\nThanks\n\nTL;DR My boyfriend grabbed me while we were upset and would not let me leave his bedroom. My arms hurt for two days and lightly bruised.

He got even more upset by me being upset, but then tried to cheer me up by telling me how a video game franchise I enjoy is being revamped. This game means a lot to me, so I began to text all my friends about it plus status update ala Facebook and Google+. He asked me to stop.

I told him he needs to fight through the depression like I do, and then I got up to leave the bed and the room.\nHe grabs my arms and refuses to let me leave.

I can&amp;#39;t deal with this. He&amp;#39;s needy and grossing me out. I pull and pull, and get free again as he started to cry. I grab my headscarf. He grabs the scarf out of my hands and grabs me again. I keep on trying to pull away, but he will not let go. It&amp;#39;s hurting so much. I do not want to give in to him, and I tell him this.

We have been together for nearly three years, and ~2.3 years of this time has been long distance( 2000 miles) because of us going to different Unis. I moved up to where he goes to school last month, and plan on going to his Uni in Jan. I am very excited about the School, so this move was more like something I was going to do eventually and he speed-ed it up a bit rather than a move solely for him in a complete disregard to my education. Adjusting to this area on the other hand has been very difficult, but  slowly I am moving past these difficulties and bettering myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, my relationship&amp;#39;s problems was not solved by me moving. We figured this was going to happen, so we have been seeing a consular since I came up here at least. That is going well. What did not go well was last Thursday. I went to his dorm to spend the night, cook dinner dinner, and study physics in that reverse order. Dinner failed because his stove is broken, so I ended up eating microwaved broccoli instead of making him a pasta dish. Physics studying failed because I was not taking it seriously enough which angered him. Even so, I kept on a happy face and we went to bed to cuddle and talk instead of argue about how he needs to get his stove fixed and how he should realize I can make my own decisions with school. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While in bed he got a bit depressed though since we had planned a happy night that did not come to be. I tried to cheer him up, but all the stress of moving, school, and work got the best of me so I began to rant to him. I did not raise my voice, rather I listed everything I need to get done for the weekend (request this transcript for Uni, sign up for the JLPT, get more hours at work, make friends, semi-translate this Islamic book for a friend, cook, laundry, grocery shopping etc). He got even more upset by me being upset, but then tried to cheer me up by telling me how a video game franchise I enjoy is being revamped. This game means a lot to me, so I began to text all my friends about it plus status update ala Facebook and Google+. He asked me to stop. I told him it&amp;#39;d only take 2 minutes, plus I was in bed with my smartphone-not on the PC. He didn&amp;#39;t like this and got very upset. I told him I can&amp;#39;t take his depression, and he really shouldn&amp;#39;t be getting so upset as it&amp;#39;s not making me happy-rather it&amp;#39;s making my list of things I need to do crush down on me instead of encourage me (oh no I&amp;#39;m gunna fail JLPT, such a waste to sign up vs YAY I can show everyone I know Japanese with a fancy certificate :3). By then I had put my phone down, but I wanted to leave the room as the environment was stifling and I felt it was silly to go to sleep at 9pm (why can&amp;#39;t we watch a movie in the living room, go for a walk around campus, do anything!!!). I told him he needs to fight through the depression like I do, and then I got up to leave the bed and the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He grabs my arms and refuses to let me leave. I think it&amp;#39;s a joke so I slide my legs which are not in his grasp off the bed and try to stand up. His nails are digging into my skin. He is very upset now. I tell him I can&amp;#39;t deal with this, and to let me go-you&amp;#39;re hurting me. He doesn&amp;#39;t. I keep on yanking as him until he finally loses grip. I move about 3 feet to the door and he grabs me again. He&amp;#39;s raising his voice. He&amp;#39;s asking me why can&amp;#39;t I comfort him, why can&amp;#39;t I do this.  I can&amp;#39;t deal with this. He&amp;#39;s needy and grossing me out. I pull and pull, and get free again as he started to cry. I grab my headscarf. He grabs the scarf out of my hands and grabs me again. I keep on trying to pull away, but he will not let go. It&amp;#39;s hurting so much. I do not want to give in to him, and I tell him this. He needs to fight through his depression, I can&amp;#39;t deal with him. I keep on saying, &amp;quot;Please let me go into the living room, please let me go, you need some time alone. I&amp;#39;ll be back in an hour, ok?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually I do give him, he lets me go, and I begin to hold and kiss him. For all of our relationship he has more or less banished me when he gets upset. He has never been clingy. When we fought while long distance he would hang up the phone and not call me for hours, and sometimes days- he needed his alone time he said. I just.. I don&amp;#39;t understand. He&amp;#39;s so gross to me now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to know if I should be cautious around him cause I&amp;#39;m unsure if this is a red flag towards future abuse.
