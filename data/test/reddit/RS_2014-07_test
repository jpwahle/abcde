{"selftext":"My dad's mother is ill and may not make it. She's 76 and he's 56, I'm 34. He's seemingly aloof. She's knocking on death's door and he's not far from it. Mom has a twenty year recovery from brain trauma, and my sister has a kick ass opportunity at a full family.\n\nThis situation is all very complicated - mood, physiology, and circumstances. Independent dad ravaged by HIV, supportive mom stunted by brain trauma for many years, and a couple of kids working to understand their parents situation in order to find a way forward.\n\nHe's been living with HIV - and occasionally AIDS for periods when he didn't keep up with his meds - for about +30 years.  He has a mild/moderate form of dementia - could be from a prolong period ten years ago when his T Cell count went to near zero, or from the weed, cocaine, etc he chose to take for a significant portion of his life. \n\nHe's retired Navy with full benefits, permanent disability from contracting HIV during the course of his duties as a Corpsman. He and my mom have never had a copacetic relationship. He was always very independent and distant - hanging with work buddies for weeks/weekends away from the family. The virus simply magnified his behavior, by my guess.\n\nIncredibly rare disease with no quantifiable timetable on life-expectancy - how would you react?\n\nThey're still married, but he continually seeks alternative housing over the passed few years through the VA Health System. He wants independence, but I don't think he's mentally and physically capable. His drivers license was taken away after three crashes in less than as year, and the HIV-induced frontal lobe damage found by the VA. My mom takes care of him, ensuring that he receives his meds and is fed, but doesn't feign at every whim for lattes and trips to various folks for conversation and weed.\n\nHe takes so many gawdamn meds. Most are for the symptoms of his HIV meds. Better situation than 15 years ago, but he's a tiny, slow version of himself. Easier to keep up with by us, but slower than he's accustomed. I worry about his mental state because of it.\n\nMy mom has always leaned on me for support, as a sounding board for important decisions, but I need an earnest stranger with rare experience for advice. She's still working through her own bought of brain trauma, and there is no one else familiar with his situation.\n\nThe failing health of his mum, my grandmother, had kicked me into another mode. \n\nHave I done enough for him?\nI ask you all what more can I do?

I think I'm suicidal but I don't think I'd have the drive to go through with it. I know people care about me and I know it'd make people upset if I was no longer here.\n\nFor the longest time, I've been depressed. I've been depressed since 2007. I was 14 then. I'm 21 now. I was with some girl in my first relationship, thought she was amazing and then she left me for my best friend. I know, it might be a hard pill to swallow for some but I guess you could say I took it bad. We were only together for 3 months but I would cry everyday for hours and not have any motivation to do anything, it was sad.\n\nOne morning, I felt this urge and I couldn't really describe it other than me not wanting to be here anymore. I wasn't violent or aggressive in that urge but I just thought \"I should probably just kill myself.\" Went to the doctor and he told me I had affective disorder. I was like fuck, I thought of depression as a bad thing as most people would but then I would just think there's some massive stigma around it and people would just think you're just faking it and you don't have it that bad.\n\nBefore I got diagnosed, my mum thought I was lazy and well, my whole family thought I was lazy because I didn't want to get out of bed and face the day. It was weird because, I would usually feel energetic and stuff but I just felt like I had no purpose or meaning and nothing I did mattered, in the end.\n\nI dropped out of college 3 times because of my depression and my motivation was non-existent. I didn't wanna do any of my work and I was really closed off when it came to making new friends and stuff. I have friends now and I'm open and positive around them and they're relatively understanding but I've never told them I wanted to commit suicide. \n\nMy ex-girlfriend from last year would cut herself and I didn't really wanna be around that. I cared but I had my own problems to attend to. I didn't really want someone who would cut herself when I didn't talk to her so I broke up with her and then she cut herself more than she ever did. I didn't really feel any emotion from her cutting herself because in the end, it was more than I could deal with and I had no grounds to help her anyway. She needed professional help.\n\nA few weeks ago, my mum got diagnosed with cancer. Lung cancer. Not from smoking, either. From Asbestos. It only affects 1% of the population or something.\nIt's early days yet but I've been thinking. If she goes, I go too. I don't really have a family member to fall back on. My two brothers who I live with still call me lazy, disgusting and they're not supportive, I guess.\n\nMy dad is a drug addict and an alcoholic and I guess my uncles, who I'm sort of close to, I guess. One is a drug addict and one wealthy and is supportive of me (financially) but he just thinks I'm lazy and that I'm leeching off the government.\n\nWith my mum having cancer, she can get something called Carer's Allowance. I told her, if she wants, she can put me down as her carer and she can have the money that the government gives me. She needs the money more than I do. My brother told my wealthy uncle that I basically told my mum that I wanna get money and that I'm going to do nothing to help her. He's generally protective of my mum and called me disgusting and lazy.\n\nDidn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't true but in the end, there's no convincing some people.\n\nI haven't had a job and people might be like \"What the fuck, you're 21 and you don't have a job. I've been working since I was 14.\" and I can sort of understand but I went straight from high school to college and did some years of college and didn't like it. I went to find a job and I told my job assistant that I was suicidal and she told me to go to the doctor. I don't think my anxiety helps either. Some people might say \"you should just take anything you can get, the economy is hard\" etc. It is. You can't choose what job you want but I guess I want some satisfaction out of it. It can be hard when you don't have very many qualifications too.\n\nI'm just rambling on now. I'm sorry but I just wanted somewhere to vent. It's really hard for me and it's hard to see through text but I just feel like crying. Sorry for the wall of text.\n\nThanks for reading, if you have.\n","retrieved_on":1441288434,"ups":6,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"SuicideWatch","created_utc":"1404174326","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.SuicideWatch","hide_score":false,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","title":"Don't know what to do","secure_media_embed":{}}

Just. Is.\n\nI can relate to your disgust about the \u201cAlpha male that doesn\u2019t give a shit and use people\u201d philosophy, I still believe that TRP is not about it, becoming an Alpha or close to it is one way that men can\u2019t be abused, I have yet to see that \u201csuccessful Beta that is in a happy relationship and completely satisfied\u201d after 16 years observing (and listening, a LOT ) every \u201cBeta\u201d that I know is in an abusive relationship, THAT is what TRP advocates against. Why is that? Because there is one dark truth around TRP at all:\n\nEveryone here, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, WAS A BETA AT SOME POINT OF THEIR LIVES. \n\nThere you have it, cold, hard truth, everyone here believed ( and some still believes ) that true love is at the next corner, everyone here asked our mom/sister/dad etc \u201chow do we get women? How do we find someone to love and care?\u201d and got fed the same things:\n\n-\tBe yourself and love will find a way\n-\tTreat her well, do everything for her\n-\tShe will appreciate and fall in love if you do nice things for her\n\nAnd they tried, some still try, it works to an extent, but the result was the same every freaking time/age, didn\u2019t happen at 14? It happened at 30, didn\u2019t happen at 50? It happened at 60, check the married men around here that discovered the RP, some stories break my heart when I see that someone suffered in an abusive relationship till their freaking fifties!\n\nRedPill is, above all, a philosophy of \u201ctake care of yourself\u201d, it puts you as the \u201cmost important person in the whole world\u201d, it doesn\u2019t teach PuA although it links to some studies, it doesn\u2019t say \u201chere is what you have to do to manipulate every woman\u201d, everything that deviates from the \u201ctake care of yourself\u201d philosophy is not RP at all, why are you attacking it when a  philosophy that turns men into a complete asset is presented to women? There is a lot of it in Vogue, in \u201cThe Game\u201d( which was originally a book for women ), Cosmo, etc, the list is endless, and I have yet to see someone on reddit advocating against these type of info, read about it, it is \u201cHow to evaluate and manipulate your man to do what you want\u201d in its entirety:\n\n-\t10 tips to choose the right man\n-\tSurefire tricks to see if he is a jerk\n-\tHow to fix your man\n-\tHooking up your prince\n\nI can go on and on, and guess what, there are worse things on feminist subs, you think objectifying woman is bad? In these subs men are less than animals, no wonder some historical feminists left the movement. Why there isn't any post about any of it on reddit, people trampled on TRP and painted it like shit, why didn\u2019t they trampled on other relationship-oriented subs? There are worse things than what you suppose TRP is I assure you, and guess what, most of these subs doesn\u2019t say \u201cHey, how about being responsible for yourself and fixing it?\u201d Nope, it is okay to be lazy/brainless/etc, fat acceptance movement, \u201cit is never your fault\u201d philosophy and so on.\n\n\nMy personal take on TRP is that they tell men to take control of their own lives, to improve themselves, to not take for granted and to become the best of themselves, it doesn\u2019t matter if he becomes a manipulative alpha, it doesn\u2019t matter if he abandons relationships at all, it doesn\u2019t matter if he uses it to keep a healthy LTR, it is his choice, it is his own way paved by himself and if he is freaking happy with it then TRP accomplished its goal. They don\u2019t develop Bros or whatever you think, they don\u2019t take you by the hand and say \u201cWe\u2019re going to turn you into a manipulative jerk\u201d, they do what most people won\u2019t tell you in your whole life which is \u201cIt is okay to be a man, and if you want to change your life you gotta work hard for it and become the man worthy of the life you want\u201d, if that phrase is wrong then me being happy as type C is wrong, what is type C? Let me give the gist of it:   \n\n-  Type A is the Alpha, you know, the bad boy, the jerk, the one that is successful in getting woman and    doesn\u2019t care at all but himself.\n-  Type B is the Beta, the one that is a good human being and does it best at it, but is frustrated because well, all his hard work and the girl that was promised to him is getting pounded by the Alpha, or is in an abusive relationship\n\nBoth have flaws and qualities, but IMHO what most want to be is the type C. Type C is combining the best of both types (Alpha and Beta) and managing his life the way he wants without being a manipulative jerk and not getting into an abusive relationship, he gets women but is clear about what he wants with them, he treats her well but won\u2019t let her step on him, he takes care of himself and has a clear path, he engages in LTR and both sides are happy, it is what RP defends, finding my own way and being happy with it.\n\nSorry for the engrish, it is not my main language, and I am happy to discuss any misconception from my part, just wanted to get out of my chest what I believe is TRP, especially for new subs, discussing sexual strategy is just a fragment of what RP is all about, I know swallowing it is a bitter experience but don\u2019t let your anger/sadness transform you into a bad human being, RP is above all, men going their own way, and being happy with themselves, this sub won\u2019t judge you if \u201cyour way\u201d is having casual sex till you\u00b4re 50, it won\u2019t judge you if \u201cyour way\u201d is engaging a LTR at 22, of course it will discuss your morals and values from choosing it, and it will say \u201ccheating is wrong\u201d and about evaluating good women, but it will always ask \u201c Are you happy with it? \u201c and if the answer is yes it will only say \u201c Nice, hope you be happy with it \u201c.\n\nEdit: Wall of text crits for 10k damage, fixed formatting, I don't know how to classify it as... \"something\"?

{"retrieved_on":1441288403,"ups":2,"media":null,"selftext":"I've posted here before, but didn't get many responses, so I figured I'd post again: \n\nI'm a mountain-climbing, computer-building, archaeologising, web-scraping nerd-thing. I studied music in college--jazz performance (piano), although I've almost not played since graduation. I also studied health and biological science, and in retrospect think I enjoyed it over the music. I graduated at the top of my class, and I suppose I'm proud enough to mention it here, but it hasn't really added to my happiness, and I could give almost no shits about how a potential partner did/does in school, as long as it's clear that they love to learn anyway.\n\nI like progressive rock--almost exclusively. Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree, Phideaux, The Flower Kings, Rush, Ayreon...all excellent, and a pretty good sampling of the type of music I listen to. I enjoy breaking music apart in my head, and focusing on the underlying structure...I loved theory far more than performance in college. I often listen to music in the same way people watch movies--with no/few other distractions. It can't just be in my background.\n\nIf I have one passion, it's learning. Learning about anything and everything. I had a professor who remarked on my ability to retain information...I like to think that my brain has an excellent index. While working toward my music degree, I studied science...anatomy and physiology, exercise physiology, chemistry, nutrition. After earning my degree, I studied archaeology. Then I worked in archaeology. Then I landed my current programming job which required (much to my delight!) that I learn to code very quickly. I would be very unsatisfied working in a field that wouldn't allow me to learn.\n\nI love psychological thrillers. House of Leaves and Infinite Jest are two of my favorite books. The Fountain may be my favorite film. A few of my top shows are: Breaking Bad, Battlestar Galactica, Sherlock, and Game of Thrones.\n\nI was raised vegetarian and still am, though a potential partner's vegetarian/vegan/omnivore status is really (really!) not a deal-breaker. That being said, I try to keep a healthy lifestyle, and don't think I could be in a relationship with a non-health conscious person. I also like to hike year-round; it's my favorite form of exercise.\n\nThe internet, and technology are important to me...I may be a bit of a hippie, but damn if I don't value my battlestation. I game, I compute, and I watch TED talks...but I don't have a smartphone or Facebook.\n\nI'm the sort of person who learns to unicycle and solve Rubik's cubes, and then does the two simultaneously for the sheer fuck of it. There's a part of my brain that realizes a skill exists, and considers learning it--and often decides \"yes!\" I drink socially, and have brewed my own beer. I don't get drunk often, but I love a good stout. I'm not a terrific cook, but I certainly try, and I do make a brilliant cheesecake.\n\nIf you're interested in the Myers-Briggs stuff, I'm an INTP. That doesn't weigh too much for me, but I thought I'd put it out there.\n\nAs for appearances, I'm 6'4\", 175lbs, and fit (but not terribly muscular). If I forget to think about it, I slouch. I try to think about it frequently.\n\nIf I had a checklist of requisites for a potential partner, a passion for learning might be the only item on it. I would be open to making a new friend, but I'm looking for a relationship. If, after reading this, you think messaging me would be a good idea, then go for it. Distance doesn't matter. At the very least, perhaps we'll have an interesting conversation. Interesting conversations are good.\n","permalink":"/r/r4r/comments/29itpt/24_m4f_vermontnew_england_i_love_to_learn_do_you/","link_flair_text":"M4F","title":"24 [M4F] Vermont/New England - I love to learn.

I've decided recently that my eating has, well, been pretty bad recently. While my dad taught me how to budget for food, I was never taught how to actually buy food in healthy portions. I've tried searching for 7 day meal plans on this subreddit, but I have a few caveats that I couldn't quite find in others' meal plans.\n\nSo let's get to the chase, eh? I'd like to build a 7 day meal plan (or a few of them for variety), but they need to fit how I can prepare food. Breakfast and dinner can pretty much be whatever, although in the morning I'd prefer to keep the prep time under 30 minutes. Lunch has to be something I can either in brown lunch bag or one of those lunch pales that can keep it cold for a few hours. I don't have access to a microwave or anything to heat up food while I'm at work (5 days a week). Ideally I'd prep this at the same time as breakfast.\n\nNow for my nutritional requirements: I'll eat pretty much anything. No real preferences. I don't have any food allergies. I'm trying to lose body fat; I'm not really concerned with my weight. I've been trying to cut down how much sugar I'm having, so low sugar is a plus. Judging from [this calculator](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/), my BMR is 2027.2 (I'm 6'1 and 190lbs). My job is pretty physical and keeps me moving and climbing for 8+ hours a day. I don't really exercise on the weekends (which I'm wanting to change).\n\nI'm expecting a package from [Naturebox](https://naturebox.com/) which I'm hoping will be enough for small snacks between meals.\n\nSo given all this information, can you guys help me build a meal plan around this or share yours if you have similar requirements? I'd like to go out and buy groceries as soon as possible.

I broke out about 2 times a year, and it was never a huge deal because I was used to getting them.  But about two years ago, I started to break out much more frequently (roughly once a month).  I was very alarmed, but had no idea what was causing them.  At first I thought it was stress from school, but I only seemed to get a cold sore a day or two before giving a speech (and it's not like I was giving a speech every month).\n\n\nAbout 6 months ago, I finally decided that I needed to find out what was triggering my outbreaks.  Around the time I started breaking out more often, I began using chewing tobacco and smoking marijuana on a regular basis.  So I stopped using these substances, but was still getting cold sores once a month.  This was pretty disheartening, and I kinda gave up.  I was ready to go to a doctor and see if there was a medication that could help, when I finally figured out what my trigger was--caffeine.\n\n\nIt was the week before finals, and I needed a little boost to start studying.  I picked up one of those 24 oz. cans of Monster and before I went to bed that night, I could already feel a cold sore coming on.  I searched on Google and found a few websites that mentioned caffeine being a common trigger of cold sores.  At this point I realized that the culprit was caffeine.  I'm not sure how I didn't realize it when I stopped chewing and smoking, but I usually had an energy drink once a day, sometimes more.\n\n\nSo I quit drinking energy drinks and have been avoiding caffeine in general, and I haven't had an outbreak yet!  I'm sure that I'll still get them once or twice a year, but this is a huge weight off my shoulders.  Anyone who gets cold sores knows how uncomfortable they can be.  I became much more negative whenever I felt an outbreak coming on and generally avoided people.  Imagine this happening once a month, and you'll understand my situation.\n\n\nI just wanted to share this, and I hope that someone reading this will benefit from it!","retrieved_on":1441288376,"ups":0,"subreddit":"self","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1404177205","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.self","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Cold sores and caffeine"}

I feel like shit. Every day I feel sick to the stomach with anxiety. I've had depression/anxiety since I was 15. I'm 19, nearly 20 now. I've been on medication for the last 3 years, since dropping out of university due to not being able to afford it. I was only studying the course to live up to the expectations of my parents and their partners (they split up when I was 4). Nothing I do is ever good enough for my father. His new wife is a bitch, and they really have had no positive impact on my life since they had a daughter 6 years ago. I live with my Mum and step dad, who are alright. My mum suffered from depression when she was my age after her mother died... \n\nI'm smart to the point where I was often looked at as gifted by everyone else. We have no money, which really I don't care about.. money means nothing to me. I'd rather live a fulfilling life but for the last year and a half that hasn't even looked like a possibility. I'm lost. stuck in a vacuum of never ending torture of mental illness. No matter what I try I can't escape, and my patience is really running thin. It's been weeks since I've been happy. Normally when I'm with my girlfriend everything goes away. Her touch would silence my demons. Now though, even when I'm in her presence I feel drained. Emotionally, physically, mentally. I'm like an empty shell. I know it's only temporary. Rain and cloudy skies go away, right? But I know for sure it'll be back another day. The negativity rules my life. \n\nSleep. Sleep is the only thing that makes any given day worth it. I sleep for maybe 16 hours a day normally.. it makes everything go by so much quicker. \n\nMy job is shit. I'm learning to drive trains. You start off in this job by throwing points and stuff on the ground for the trains to direct them while another guy drives. I'm supposed to be learning to drive and I want to, however noone thinks that my three years of experience is enough. I go to work and they refuse to teach me because they are afraid that I'll take their job. I've be en trying to improve my life and minimize the impact of negativity and negative people, culling most of it. I have positive people around me at most times, but it's not enough. I'm sick of being tortured by my head and forced into the endless downward spiral that is mental illness. What do I do? \nI came home from work the other day, bought some jumpers and some supplements for gym.. $500 later, I was OK with spending that money. My step dad (who doesn't have a job) came in and decided to start abusing me. I've never felt so embarrassed in my life. My friend was there with me and the onslaught of being called stupid and an idiot broke me in ways you couldn't imagine. I thought everything in my life was going well until recently. I thought I was overcoming it. But what is the point in overcoming it if it comes back 10x worse each time? I'm numb. I'm so fucking sick of being numb. Nothing I do is enough for anyone and I've been told it all my life. \n\nThe only thing worth staying for is my girlfriend, and the last few weeks I've felt like I've been unintentionally pushing her away. I try to talk to her about it and she assures me that she doesn't get annoyed or upset by it. She tells me that she loves me, but I can tell that it sometimes pushes her too far. I love her too, but I hate seeing her like that because of me. I want to be the guy that makes her happy all the time, rather than the one with that fucked up head that makes things harder than they should be. I've spent the last 10 minutes typing this, so excuse any errors.. I just need someone to talk to. I'm seeing a doctor this afternoon to look at changing medication. I booked in to see a councillor a few weeks ago, but that appointment isn't for another month. I don't even know if I'll be able to wait that long... Sorry for all of this bullshit... I just want it all to go away and some times dying looks like it would be the best option, not only for me but for everyone.

At least once a week when I'm laying in bed I hear very faint talking. Nothing I can make sense of. It sounds like someone is watching the news but the volume is very low. I thought nothing of it until about a year ago. The talking was louder, but still quiet enough that I couldn't make it out. The next morning my mom asked if I was watching tv the night before and I told her I was going to ask her the same thing (she doesn't have a TV in her room, but she does have a radio.) So that got me thinking I'm not the only one who hears this or atleast this one time. \nSkip ahead until a few months ago still experiencing this talking. I was asleep and I was dreaming that somehow I was laying down and pushing myself backward like someone was dragging me only no one was there. Well then I \"wake up\" from that dream only to be in a different dream where I'm in my bed and yet again experiencing this dragging. I got freaked out and woke myself up completely and realized my feet were uncovered and I was laying slightly lower in my bed that normal. I was far enough down my bed my shins were off the bed. I don't like to sleep with any body parts laying off of the bed because I just picture things grabbing them and it freaks me out.\nSo what do you think? ","retrieved_on":1441288375,"ups":2}

My bf is supposed to drive with me on the road trip and we were going to make a little vacation out of it.  I've been sad at the idea of leaving him for weeks, but excited to get some alone time together.  Then, last night, my boyfriend of 8 months confessed that at the start of our relationship he cheated on me a number of times with his ex-wife.  \n\nBack story:  They have 3 kids.  He has primary custody.  Ex-wife is a train-wreck who is pregnant for the fifth time by a fourth guy.  Don't do the math, it's too confusing...  She never shows up for these kids unless he gives her money or reminds her that she might want to come to their birthday party/etc.  She watches them during the day a lot, but somehow that means that she's not responsible for them at any other (seemingly inconvenient for her) time.  Any time we ask her to watch the kids for a night it takes about a week of begging and I've recently found out - bribing.\n\nThey got married very young, had kids very young.  Their marriage broke up when she was sleeping around with everyone and causing lots of problems for my boyfriend, his family, their kids, etc.\n\nI moved here about a year ago and started talking to him.  He told me he was divorced and had three kids and we decided to be friends.  We ended up talking all the time and eventually started dating.  Now, at the beginning of our relationship, I was definitely hesitant to define it as a bf/gf thing as I was unsure I wanted to get involved with a guy with this much baggage.  He's 27, I'm 26.  But things kept moving along, and we spent so much time talking to each other and connecting on everything, that I couldn't believe how happy I was.  Did I mention sex with him is the best I've ever had?\n\nSomewhere around the time when we first started dating, I found out that he wasn't yet divorced.  He mentioned to me in passing that he was going to a court date the next day and would need to be up early.  I was shocked, I thought he was already divorced.  Then it came out that he was legally separated and in the process of getting divorced, but that he just needed the papers signed that next day.  Well, we broke up for about 48 hours, and I told him to get his stuff together.... but he was right.  All that was left was for the judge to sign the documents at court that day and he was legally divorced.\n\nWe started moving forward again and I eventually met the kids.  Since then I've been around them about 4-5 nights a week, usually swinging by there after work and spending the night.  We spend every weekend together.  His kids are awesome.  We've had our ups and downs with the adjustment of me coming into the picture, but I think it's been worth it.\n\nLast night he confessed to me that when we first start dating he cheated on me about 5 times... but when he mentioned the dates, it was really the first 3 months of our relationship.  This was during the time where we first said, \"I love you,\" and he said it first.  This was during the time where we had a condom break and I went and got an IUD (both painful/not fun processes).  This was a time that literally ended about 2 weeks before he met my parents (and after he had already met my brother and best friend from childhood).  I texted with his ex a few short texts, and she confirmed everything.\n\nFor the past 20 hours I have been so shocked and hurt and I can barely look at him.  I love him so much, and really feel like before yesterday I could have spent the rest of my life with him.  We click in every way, and spend hours just happy to talk to each other.  He knows what I'm thinking before I say it, and he knows just the thing to make me smile.  And most importantly, he's supportive and cares about me... like when I got this new job opportunity that mean I could further my career but would end up having to leave him for we don't know how long.  He told me to take it and said he wanted me happy and wanted the chance to be with me and didn't want me to ever feel like he was holding me back.\n\nWhich is why I'm so shocked that he did this.  He flat out lied about it for the past six months.  We've chatted so many times about cheating and his crazy ex, and he never flinched.  I've made it clear that I've been cheated on before and would not accept that kind of behavior in a relationship at this point, and he never even hinted.  All I can do is picture them in my head, and I can't believe he was sleeping with her and turning around and sleeping with me.  Not to mention the fact that he wasn't always using condoms.  \n\nHe said that he stopped because things started getting serious with us and he wanted to be with me.  And that it was all a big mistake and he was never attracted to her anyway.  That each time only lasted a few minutes and he feels horrible about it.  He says that he'll do anything to prove that he wants me and only me, and the only reason he kept it a secret so long was because he didn't want to lose me.\n\nI told him I wanted him to make some moves to fix this situation - like hiring a lawyer to get out from having to deal with the crazy whims of his ex-wife.  \n\nI feel so lost right now.  Do I tell him not to come with me?  I know it is both their faults equally, but I kind of don't care about her.  Don't get me wrong, I don't get why everyone sleeps with her... I'm an intelligent/attractive girl.  I've worked hard my whole life and I thought I had found the one.\n\nHow can I still love him but be so hurt?  I've spent the last day crying and feeling like a family member died.  I feel like the person I knew with him is gone and I don't know if I can get it back.  He's my best friend.  Is it worth trying?  Or does it make me weak to want to try?  Should I cut and run since I'm moving in two days anyway?\n\nMy bf is a big reddit reader and I know he loves the Ask Men and Ask Women forums... so I'm hoping he won't see this here.  I really appreciate any advice anyone has.

I had, in my eyes, a fantastic junior year season after an atrocious sophomore year season. My sophomore year was incomplete due to some family issues and I had to fly home from school. But I decided to give my 100% into track for junior year and it definitely paid off--I went to NCAA nationals for both indoor and outdoor (DIII) in the 60m and 100m (and 4x1!), respectively. I ended my year with PRs in everything, the times you can see in my flair. I am certainly happy with how I did this year but there were times where I just got plain frustrated--like I had reached my physical limit in terms of speed. I'm 21 and in tip-top shape (for the most part haha), do you guys think I have more in me? Have I already reached my limit?\n\n\nI want to do great things. My goal is to be one of the best DIII 100m dashers next year and get the All-American title. But I also want to be as close to first as I can be, if not first. The winner of the 100m dash this year ran around a 10.3 or 10.4, is it unrealistic for me to think that I can get there as well?\n\n\nI have had judicious private coaching but I still think there are many areas in which I can improve. I am willing to put in all of the work that I need to. The biggest area I need help with is in my diet--I love food too much and for the most part, I can't control my portions. \n\n\nThis thread has no real purpose but I just needed to share my thoughts. I'm excited for this offseason and I'm going to build up my strength. It's a long season but I'm ready to conquer it. \n\n\nLet me know of all and any thoughts...

And for dinner usually some meat or poultry or fish, with some broccoli or corn and pasta or rice. Then there are snacks. I usually eat a snack around 3, and after dinner. I tend to gobble down cookie after cookie (entamins are my favorite). Sometimes I eat like 7 or 8 black and white cookies (serving size is 1).\n\nI am also really active. During high school, I would play sports with my friends everyday, as well as play on the school teams and a handful of outside teams (athletic sports). \n\nSo I was wondering if you guys can help me to gain some good weight and get my diet in check. Like what would be a sample diet for a day for me?","permalink":"/r/diet/comments/29iy0b/not_really_a_usual_post_for_this_subreddit_but_i/","link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"author":"Thray_oway","from":null,"id":"29iy0b","archived":true,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_29iy0b","saved":false,"over_18":false,"num_comments":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"quarantine":false,"score":0,"edited":false,"stickied":false,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/29iy0b/not_really_a_usual_post_for_this_subreddit_but_i/","subreddit_id":"t5_2qlfr","from_kind":null,"created":1404182441,"from_id":null}

This is my first time writing you and it concerns the decision made today by the Supreme Court of the United States. In the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby case, it was decided that employers could chose not to cover medical expenses that go against their religious faith. This particular case was about how contraception went against the Christian faith, the religion of the family who owns Hobby Lobby. \n\t\nThe fact that women are being treated as second class citizens is a travesty in itself, and I do believe they are on the front lines of this case because they are being treated as second class citizens, yet my main concern is that businesses now see a way to lower costs legally by claiming to now be religious. There is an incentive for businesses to become more religious because it gives them leverage to pay less for employee health care. Why wouldn\u2019t a business owner simply change his or her religion to pay less in employee health care?\n\t\nThere are some religions that don\u2019t believe in medical services which today are seen as essential. Here is a quote from Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader\u2019s dissent statement\n\n\"Would the exemption\u2026extend to employers with religiously grounded objections to blood transfusions (Jehovah's Witnesses); antidepressants (Scientologists); medications derived from pigs, including anesthesia, intravenous fluids, and pills coated with gelatin (certain Muslims, Jews, and Hindus); and vaccinations[?]\u201d\n\nThere are also religions that believe healing occurs only through prayer and reject medical sciences outright. If I were an evil business owner today I would simply change my religion to Christian Science and claim the Affordable Care Act forced me to pay for services that were against my religion.\n\nIt would be egregiously immoral for any of this to happen, a business becoming religious to save in overhead costs. One of my deepest concerns is this ruling will cause businesses to resort to these tactics to remain \u201ccompetitive\u201d. The path to lower health care costs has been set at the expense of the American employee, and I while I remain optimistic of the future, this decision perverts all religions and makes religion a business opportunity to save overhead costs.\n\nMy opinion is that healthcare needs to be funded publicly, yet my main concern is bringing this issue to light for you.\n\nThank you for taking the time to hear me out. I urge you to solve this crisis sooner than later for I fear a lack of confidence in the American economy.\n\n","retrieved_on":1441288339,"ups":2,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":11,"archived":true,"id":"29iygi","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_29iygi","author":"JayWaves","from":null,"is_self":true,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalTalk/comments/29iygi/letter_i_wrote_to_my_congressman_after_burwell_v/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2ycg6","created":1404182762,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"score":2,"edited":false}

I wouldn't normally do this in front of my friends who have only seen me with girls.\n\nI went out on a Sunday night and met this guy that I found really attractive and I couldn't control my self. I had my straight mates around me at the time, but they were completely fucked and incoherent. I went off somewhere private in the club to talk to him and we exchanged numbers then parted ways for the night. I finished up at around 4am and had to take care of my mates and made sure they got home alright. After all that I reply to the messages that this guy sent me, they were really fucking hot and I immediately accepted his offer for me to come over.\n\nI went over to his house at around 5am and this being my first time ever with a man, I completely clueless as to what he wanted to do. To clear things up, I'm 19 and he's 25. It was really cold at the time so I just got into his bed and wanted him to cuddle me. I have always wanted to rest my head on someone's warm chest and have them hold me. This happened for about a minute then we started making out and it felt great. He was great after I explained to him my situation, and he assured me that we wouldn't do anything that I was uncomfortable with.\n\nI won't explain everything we did, but this went on for about 8 hours before he had to go into work ( already 1.5 hours late (; ) I dropped him off at his work, as it is quite close to my house and we made out once more in my car. I would normally feel fatigued after 8 hours of constant sexual activity without sleep, but I honestly felt amazing that entire day.  \n\nHe messaged me throughout the whole day and wanted to meet up again after work. I of course agreed and was fucking excited for him to finish. Annoyingly, I fell asleep on my couch whilst watching world cup replays and I woke up to a few hours after he had finished work. He had to wake up really early the next morning, and having had no sleep since our last encounter, He was pretty fucking tired i'd imagine. So when I reply to his messages he said that he was on the verge of crashing, and we had agreed to meet up again another time. \n\nEver since then I cannot stop thinking about those 8 hours, and am I glad that I asked for this week off from work after my finals cause I would not be able to focus on anything else. I have never felt these sort of emotions before, and did not expect them to to happen after spending an entire morning with a guy.\n\nI just really felt the need to tell someone about this to help me control my emotions.

{"media":null,"selftext":"Hey guys! I'm pretty new to Reddit &amp; actually found this page from ThoughtCatalog but so glad I did because I seem to fit right in.. I have never told anyone this except my mom because I was afraid of peoples judgments and/or actions towards me but she seems to believe me but I'm here more for answers or to see if anyone else has experienced this. \n\nBack when I was 16 (I'm 23 now) I started seeing this spirit, I guess you could call him that. He was not a shadow man or a white blob, nothing like that. I still to this day remember EXACTLY what he looks like; he wears a red plaid button down shirt, he's latino, black mustache, appears short and has jeans on and a baseball hat, probably in his mid thirties or forties. But he's not a real person, how I know this is because the first time I saw him was in my house &amp; I about shit my pants. My parents live in a 2-story house, my room was the only one upstairs but our hallway was a partial catwalk meaning I could see below into our front entry way and the stairs coming up to the second floor. Anyways there's a landing on the staircase because our stairs were in an L shape. It was about 430 in the morning &amp; I woke up to go the bathroom which was down the hall from my room, and he was standing on the landing (I could see him because we have nightlights in our hallways, otherwise it was pitch black in my house). I froze in fear, I'm actually getting goosebumps typing this. I just stood in my doorway and stared at him, once I regained my thinking I sprinted to the bathroom. I shut the door and was honestly in shock or disbelief and I stayed in there awhile. I came out and he was gone. \n\nDidn't tell my mom about that initially because I didn't want to seem crazy. Few weeks go by, I forget about him, thought my mind was just playing tricks on me or something. But one morning I was driving to school, it was 530 in the morning, we had early track practice so it was just starting to get light out. My parents live in a subdivision and there's a stop sign at the end of the subdivision that leads onto the main road. Well I'm driving down the road about to get to the stop sign when all of a sudden I can see him standing across the road from the stop sign just staring at me. Again I froze, didn't even know what to do. Just sat in my car and stared at him for a few minutes, finally I got so damn scared I quickly sped away to practice, but looking at him in the rear mirror he was still standing there now facing the direction my car was going. When I got home from school I told my mom about both incidents and she believed me. She didn't suggest going to see a psychologists or anything, she just wanted to see if it would happen again and where. \n\nFast forward 7 years later, I see him again. And this was just this past November, first time I've seen him since I was 16. He's in my house again this time, still just staring at me but this time right in my damn doorway to my room. Scaring the shit out of me because this is the closest he's ever been to me. I wake my boyfriend up but by the time he is somewhat awake, I look back and my spirit dude is gone. I don't know if his presence is actually 'scary' or the fact that I'm just terrified of anything paranormal. Now it's almost July and haven't seen him but think about him quite frequently.. Has this figure of a person or any kind of spirit randomly comes to anyone else? And does anyone know why?\n\nI should also add this in, I think it may be important. The first time I saw him had to be in February or March, well my little sister had died that November. She had red hair, was 12 years old and freckles so looked nothing like my spirit. The third time I saw him my best friend had just passed away, he had a heart problem, huge kid with blonde hair &amp; blue eyes. So maybe this guy is some kind of spirit that comes to me when people die? I literally have no idea. But the only times I've seen him or when I completely forget about him or when someone dies. \n\nI'm so hoping someone else has experienced something like this! I suck dick at drawing but I could try &amp; draw what he looks like if his description sounds like a spirit you have seen. Anyone have any explanation PLEASE let me know.

So I am currently on probation for a possession charge and have to pass two UA's, one in July and one in August. I can take them whenever I want during those months. The last time I smoked was on June 21st, so I am not going to take the one in July until after the 21st of July. I got my charge on Apr. 25th and stopped smoking after that for about 3 1/2 weeks because I was pretty upset about getting in trouble. However, I smoked about a 1/4 oz. between late May and June 21st. I am 5'9\" and about 160 lbs. I also eat pretty healthy and exercise roughly 4 times a week. \n\nSince I quit smoking weed on June 21st, I bought a pack of cigarettes because I enjoy the act of smoking as it is a great stress reliever. I've kept myself to a strict one cig per day limit. The question I have is if tobacco slows down the body's process of eliminating THC. Should I quit smoking cigarettes, as well?

And she asked for some ice. And me being me not thinking about anything I just grabbed her some ice and gave it to her, before I go on prior to this my girlfriend is also my best friend so we like to have fun and what not, she dared me to get a number because a convo before I told her I would never do it I'm Not good at doing so, back to before. This woman was talking to me and I was being short and not flirty just being my self upfront and honesty and I'm one I Those too nice of a person, and she asked how old I was and I told her honestly I didn't think anything of this but being a normal Conversation, and she laugh and said something and mentioned today is her birthday, me not caring if I sounded rude, I asked how old she is today and she told me 34 and loudly laughed and said I probably think she's ugly and old, then her friend came along and said something about them drinking at a local bar, so I figured here's a good time to get her number even tho I don't want anything to do with her so I got it and, and she joked about her being old and ugly and me being nice I can't agree with that, so I said nah your attractive no worries. So then she left and my friends came back and I tried to give them Her number because I didn't want it. They said no the I asked if they wanted me to try to hook them up with her friends, said id try to hold her attention while he talked to her friend, well I kept my space away from her talking about nothing and keeping it short, she tried to flirt and I would shoot her down every time, trying to kill time with my friend and she tried grabbing my hand so I swam away a little to get some distance and the waves would keep pushing me closer. I tried to avoid being close to her as much as possible till a big wave pushed me right next to her and she grabbed on to me and I couldn't get away , she had her legs wrapped around my knee and I was leaning back to not be to close to her, and every time I would look at her she would try to get close so I kept trying to back away and milk it out for my buddy to talk to her friend and I kept looking over to see if he's good yet or not, which he wasn't when a big wave came and he me and I went under, as soon as I came up I looked at her and she put her head near my cheek like she was kissing it and I pulled away scared cuz I have a gf and this is getting to be so much I look away for a second looking for my friends then I look back and she grabs my neck and pulls me in for barley a second and kisses me, I opened my both and tried to back out at the same time and I felt her tongue try to go in and immediately pulled back and got away from her, then when I got the chance I texted her and told her I have.

It's time I get serious about my finances and this sub has been most helpful in the last year of my journey. I was wondering if you all could help me with some questions I've got. \n\nAbout me: I'm in my mid 20's and own my own business. I started this business with about $200 4 years ago, and after reading books by Tim Ferriss and the like I set out to build it into a life that I would never have to retire from. \n\nThe financial details:\n\n* Graduated in 2010 with about $30k in student loans, paid them off in 2 1/2 years. \n* Mortgage: House and office purchased in June of last year. $320,000 left of $350,000 total loan.\n* Only other debt: solar panel loan, $7k left on one and $12.5k on the second paid through incentives for the next 10 years\n* $20,000 cash slush fund, $20,000 in bank\n* up until August of last year I rented everything - Apartment and office to the tune of $2.5k per month. \n* 2 new businesses in the works to diversify income stream. \n\nI do not have any other savings, 401k's etc. I've never had much financial guidance, so have always done simple things like stash money.\n\nPersonal expenses per month:\n\n* $2,200 mortgages, usually pay between $3,500 &amp; $5,000\n* $125 solar loan, usually pay $500-1,000 will be gone in November\n* $400 oil\n* $55 internet\n* $150 health insurance\n* $100 car insurance\n* $1,000 food/clothing/entertainment/travel/home maintenance/misc (for 2 people)\n\nMy income is now high for my age, but has not always been. My business is currently valued at about $800k, bringing in about $250k revenue last year. Of that I took home about $122k. My 4 years of running this business and being employed have seen my income at 30k/58k/89k/122k, much of which I invested back into my business and rent until I could save up for down payments to buy.\n\nPrevious years have seen all expendable income go to building my business, and now I have everything built to sustain growth for about 3 more years before any investment is needed (machinery expansion, etc). Last year saw most of it go towards purchasing property and renovating it. I redid a lot of the house I bought, and it's value is now about 15% more than I paid for it 12 months ago. I also have a specialized work vehicles that I built, that was about $45k over the last 18 months (needed for business). I paid cash and modified it myself, and it's now worth $15k more than I paid for it if I were to sell.\n\nSo my questions are pretty simple: What personal investing should I be doing, and should I do it as the expense of growing my business? \n\nMy current goal is to pay off all property and be debt free by the time I am 30. My thought process is that if I own my property outright, then lower all monthly costs (hence the solar, and soon wood furnace to kill the oil bill), I can spend my days running my businesses and having kids. My personal expenses are extremely low besides the property; I don't have tv, car payments, credit card loans, or student loans, and I live very sparingly.  \n\nI know that I should not traditionally be paying off property instead of investing in IRA's and 401(k)'s...though I don't totally know why. So my questions are, with this situation, should I stop paying off my debts and invest some, or continue to do what I'm doing with the end goal of being 30 years old with a home/office/business that is paid for, working happily for the rest of my days saving whatever I make over $35k? \n\nThank you in advance! And sorry for the throwaway, just a safety measure!","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/financialindependence/comments/29j19w/questions_about_becoming_independent_am_i_already/","is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"[deleted]","name":"t3_29j19w","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"id":"29j19w","archived":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":0,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"score":2,"edited":1404181351,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2t34z","created":1404184611,"from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/29j19w/questions_about_becoming_independent_am_i_already/","secure_media":null}

I see a man      in my room every night, he has a dog  beside him that looks like a    husky, he is very pale and has dark green eyes, also he has long black hair and always wheres different clothing. He speaks to me, tells me strange things like that I need      to kill people in specific ways, I have dreams of him  and his dog eating corpses     in my room and stabbing me while i sleep.    One night he said i needed to kill someone named Justin Hazel after he survived a plane crash. He  said a plane would     crash in a nearby  feild and Justin would be the      only survivor, and that i need to come to the crash and carve the words \"the vanisperous evnos of nye\" in his chest. I ignored the imaginary figure and went to sleep. When i woke up I saw the imaginary figure (who called   himself Vandoris) in front of      my door. I ignored  him and tried to open my door, expecting my hand yo pass through him I reached for the door nob. He grabbed my hand and threw it back to my side, though i was before wearing a orange shirt I   was now  wearing a blue  jacket withe words staind in blood Vanisperous      Evnos of Nye on the front.He pushed me across the room onto my bed then warped beside it, he then vanished. I got rid of the cloths in the woods but when i came home my family was dead with those words carved in them. More people died with the carvings until my hole block was dead,    the police blamed me for the murders. I was put in prison. Vandoris said he would let me out of my cell if i would actualy kill them like he told me to. So he opened the door    to my cell, but  then a knife slid out of his sleeve and into his hand. Vandoris put the knife to my neck and the to my stomach, he kept his body the same way but just leaned tward me causing the knife to slide         into my stomach. Then he grabbed                   my arm and we appeared at my home.   He said i needed to  kill the    man             behind me but   I saw    nothing there. He handed me a knife and told me to swing. I reared the knife back and then quickly spun around     and  threw the knife      at  Vandoris.   He  caught it by the   blade and  it cut    his hand. As i looked    down  my hand was     pouring blood  as i saw it was cut    like the  hand    of Vandoris.

I'm looking for someone to exchange either written letters or emails with. I don't really care who you are, as long as you're interesting. See, the thing about getting to know someone else, specially someone you've never met, is that you need to know whether or not you both connect on some level. I've tried this pen pal thing before, and it didn't last. At some point, either of us, or both, get \"lazy\" or disinterested and the communication just stops. But think about your friends. Would you ever stop talking to them? Of course not. You've already established a well-founded connection that will last way more than just a few months of extended emails. This is why you have to be interesting to me (just as I have to be to you) so we can form a connection and build the friendship. But if at any point in time you find that you just don't want to email or write anymore, a simple letter or email saying so will do. \n\nNow, I'm looking for someone open minded, friendly, nice, mature. I'm looking for someone who can talk about anything. I'm looking for someone with opinions, but ones you won't want to shove down my throat (no offense). I'm looking for someone who wants to get to know the person they are emailing, and are willing to be as open about themselves. I'm looking for someone who I won't have to coerce to get a few paragraphs out of. I'm looking for someone who can be a self-starter (example: there are times when I'm down and won't email back right away or at all some days, but I need someone to be a self-starter and email back. Or, other example: be a self-starter and make conversation instead of me having to do it always). I'm looking for someone who is real (and if you have to make a joke about this or ask me what it means, then you clearly aren't the person I'm looking for). Don't be fooled by my serious tone throughout this; I'm also looking for someone with a great sense of humor. I know not everybody has the same sort of humor, so I guess as we get to know each other we'll figure that out. I'm looking for someone who likes to have deep conversations and isn't afraid of them. I'm also looking for someone who is consistent, honest, and trustworthy. \n\nOh! And a huge one: I'm an extremely understanding person when it comes to others. I'm super selfless with all my friends. I try to help them in any way I can, listen to them when they need me, etc. I will be the same with you, but you need to be willing to be the same back. It gets tiring being the only one who seems to care in a friendship. I don't need someone disrespecting me, or being condescending, or any other way. \n\nI would love someone international, but honestly, I don't care. Also! I would require we exchange photos at some point. It would be nice to know who I'm talking to. Let's face it, as human beings, we're quite visual. I'm 9 times out of 10 described as cute, and apparently I have a great smile (most common compliments).\n\nAnything else I forgot to mention, I'll be sure to let you know. If you're still here reading, thanks! If interested, PM me :)\n\n","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.penpals","subreddit":"penpals","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1404182438","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"23 F US - Looking for a snail mail or email pen pal","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"stickied":false,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r076","created":1404186038,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/29j3d8/23_f_us_looking_for_a_snail_mail_or_email_pen_pal/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"score":12,"edited":1404198266,"id":"29j3d8","archived":true,"name":"t3_29j3d8","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"num_comments":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"is_self":true,"author":"esmeburr","from":null}

Well, alright enough.\n\nAround the evening i feel trapped and almost panicked, because i know soon i will have to sleep. I dread sleeping.\n\nI never really do sleep... I sort of go to bed, and think about things. Bad things. I can't control it. I obsessively think about things when i'm trying to sleep, usually ending up in some state where i'm half asleep, sort of dreaming about terrible things, but still awake enough to know i'm laying in bed. Being in this state does get me rested enough to function the next day however, which is why i rarely snap myself out of it. Because i can just sort of become fully awake at will if i force myself to move. \n\nI've had trouble sleeping for a long time... but it become suddenly worse about 7 or 8 months ago, when i was about to fall asleep, and i suddenly remembered that i'm going to die. Not necessarily soon or anything, but eventually it will happen somehow. When i had that thought i actually felt an intense stabbing pain in my stomach. Actual physical pain. Like i'd been stabbed with something hot. I mean, i'd never forgotten that fact and had always been rather ok with it, but from that second on, i couldn't even function because of it.\n\nEven now, every second that passes... i feel it being one less second i have to exist. At the end of every day, that's one less. I mean i've been like this for about 8 months now. It hardly seems like anything, but that's a considerable amount of time. A huge chunk of one's entire existence. \n\nThere are other things too... some less significant, like the fact that i wear glasses. For some reason, the idea that my eyeballs don't work without bits of glass in front of them just makes me think i'm just messed up. Like i'm disabled, and just not as good as everyone else. It's not a self esteem thing, since i know no one in their right mind judges people for wearing glasses. It's that... i am not good enough physically to exist without being corrected.\n\nAnd then there's this other issue that depresses me beyond much else. There's this girl i met online when i was just a kid, 8 years ago now. I've always been socially inept, plus i suffer from terrible derealization due to a neurological disorder (visual snow) so having any sort of relationship/friendship/bond with anyone is near impossible for me. But somehow, with her... it's different. I spend most of my time feeling nothing at all. But the one thing i always get to look forward to, is talking to her. It's the only thing that has made me feel good at all since i've had the VS/derealization, going on 5 years now. But the fact is, she's just someone i know online. Sounds like a catfish scam, i realize... but i have seen more than enough evidence to be sure it's not like that. See, i'd do anything to actually meet her, even if it's just once. But even still living with my parents and working a job, i make less than the amount of money i need just for the most basic expenses. I don't think i'll ever be able to afford to go see her... and no one else can even make me feel half decent about anything. I'm not sure why she's so different, but she is. :/\n\nAnd there's one last thing... that i think about.\n\nCollege. I'm 22, almost 23, and i've not been to college. When i graduated high school, i didn't see myself as having any options. My parents aren't rich, they won't give me their info so i can fill out the FAFSA, and they have financial troubles, so i can't have them cosign on a loan. I mean right now, i suppose having a job and always paying my bill online, i might have good enough credit to just get a loan myself to go to college. But i'm getting old for it. Every day that passes, is one less day i have to exist. I should just go to college as soon as possible if i want to make something of myself. But aside from the financial stuff, another thing is stopping me... that girl i mentioned, the one who has the ability to make me stop being stressed and depressed just by exchanging a few words... if i go to college, i'd be giving up completely on ever meeting her. Or at the very least for 5 years. I don't know if that's something i want to give up. It's a choice between making minimum wage forever with a chance at happiness one day, or giving up on that but living better by having a degree. I have no idea what to do.\n\nBut this isn't about figuring out any of that. Or maybe it is. The problem is i cannot sleep. I can never sleep. And those are the reasons why. What can i do?\n\nI already go to the gym, and hit it hard. Avoid caffeine except in the early morning, and i've tried relaxation techniques, melatonin, even natural stuff like Valerian root and tart cherry juice. Nothing works. It's not even proper insomnia. I get tired, i feel like i want to sleep, but the storm going on in my head keeps me from it.\n\n","retrieved_on":1441288261,"ups":2,"subreddit":"depression","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1404183227","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.depression","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"default","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Sleep is torture."}

The guy I'm dating basically just told me that he's uncomfortable with having sex with me and being my first because he doesn't want that level of commitment. So, we didn't really...completely end things, but neither of us are contacting each other at the moment.\n\nI've just realized, that whenever I chatted with him...he'd always bring up reasons why he shouldn't be with me, and sort of frame them as if they're my fault. He wouldn't cut things off, he'd keep talking to me, keep saying goodnight, even inviting me out, but kept on bringing up reasons why he was wary of continuing the relationship. 'You're too inexperienced. Shit shit shit.' I can't control how inexperienced I am, right here, right now, without a time machine. I mean...I'm sorry I don't view it as a bad thing? I'm sorry it just never happened? I'm sorry I like you and want to lose it to you? *Ugh.*\n\nI should have said a while ago, 'Sorry, I only want to date someone who is excited about dating me. I don't want to have to convince you why you should date me.' However, I found myself doing just that. I don't want to be emotional mush who is totally addicted to the way someone makes me feel to the point that they make me behave in a way I'm ashamed to behave. I don't want to feel like I'm disrespecting myself because I want their company so bad that I'm willing to let them walk all over me to get it.

I felt sad for what he had turned me into.\n\nI guess I'm just learning, seeing (I haven't actually been in a real relationship where I honestly and truly had developed real feelings for them until this guy) you can really like someone, and they can really like you, and you can seem to be totally compatible in most ways, but have it still not be a good idea for you to be together.\n\nAlso, as a virgin on OKC, what do you do? I'm 22 years old, and it seems that most people I've met and really like are not interested in being my 'first.' That's just too much of a commitment.

He was understanding, but concerned that it would negatively impact our friendship. Last night, after a weeklong visit to my home, I told him I wanted to kiss him. It was the latest in an ever-growing list of particularly biting errors I've committed in my life. It was a nightmarish experience, and I tried several times unsuccessfully to wake myself up. \n\nWhat was there on his end, for the past year, was the well reasoned suspicion that I hadn't gotten over my feelings for him, and those suspicions were confirmed outright. On my end, a desire that seemed so trivial came to light as a source of mistrust that existed between us as friends. *I was given a second chance*, and I strangled it to death after a week, after being given an entire year to think about what I'd done. I would never have forgiven me, if I were him. I would have given up *long ago*. Even though I can tell *he's grown tired of this shit,* he does forgive me. After many apologies, he forgives me even now. I'm grateful for his willingness to forgive me, but I can't help but wonder whether or not I deserve to be forgiven.\n\nHe's leaving tomorrow morning, and I've spent the entire day with an aching feeling in my chest. Something nasty within me had come to light. The lie of my life, that unrequited attraction was just as valid and emotionally important, had been exposed as such. The years during and after puberty have been terrifyingly selfish for me. I haven't put anyone's feelings before my own, and I've damaged some of my dearest friendships by insisting on something beyond reason, beyond *fucking common sense*. \n\nIt doesn't feel good to be on either end of this. Aside from physical torture or death, there are few things worse than it.\n\nThis is the fifth time something like this has happened between me and a straight man. That number is exact. The mere thought of this phenomenon, this *character trait of mine*, is nauseating. I'm 23 now. In the 7 years I've had a libido, I have *never* enjoyed it. It has *always* been my primary source of pain, suffering, and sadness. I love myself, but I need to rid myself of the drives that transform me from a thinking creature into an unrecognizable horror that frightens me when I look into the mirror. When I'm told of my transgressions against others from a third party, I see myself for what I truly have been: *a fucking fool*, and nothing short of it.\n\nI need to forgive myself for this, but the fact that this is the fifth time this has happened means I'm doing something gravely wrong in the recovery process. My actions have hurt me deeply, and they show no sign of stopping. I must ask: How can I escape from this horror with my friendships intact? Will this kind of thing heal with time, or is there something deeply wrong here?","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/askgaybros/comments/29j51y/i_have_repeatedly_harmed_my_best_friendships/"}

That's when I KNEW FOR SURE. \n\nThat said, I've been thinking about it nonstop since the 16th and I actually already love it and feel protective, if that is even possible. I am thinking about abortion, but only because my SOs family is literally so religious that they will disown him, and I am so scared that he will lose his family, or I will lose him and have to go it alone. I am actually very open to adoption, although I am really not a strong person emotionally at all so I hope I can grow some balls in the next 8 months. \n\nI fucked up my life royally this year by sleeping through an exam. I was supposed to graduate this month, but unfortunately I had to drop that course because I lost 40% of the grade on that exam. The rest of the grade is made up clinically (nursing). The problem is that I need this last course to grad next june, and it is ONLY offered in January because of the clinical component. The clinical placement is 40 hours/week UNPAID, days and nights following a nurse preceptor. With a due date at the end of February, I don't even know how the hell I could keep up an unpaid job and a newborn, and who the heck would watch him. Also, putting off school for ANOTHER year at this point cannot happen. My student loans become payable in October, and I NEED to be financially stable by the end of next year because I have racked up 40k. My boyfriend is doing his Masters/PHD reclass, and still has about 4 years left. He makes 400 biweekly plus a scholarship amount of 17k per year. \n\nI seriously feel like stealing a car and driving it into a large body of water right now. I haven't told the father yet- he's going to FREAK OUT (mostly about the family and disowning bit) and I need to gather my thoughts. \n\nPlease, if you have had an unplanned pregnancy at a young age, or against all odds and kept it, tell me your story and how things turned out. I really want to keep my baby but I just don't know how it will ever work, logistically. I don't care to hear about abortion, I am well informed about that option, although anybody who has given their child for adoption is more than welcome to post, that is a huge consideration as well.\n\nI really appreciate the help today, ladies. \n"}
{"media":null,"selftext":"So I'm really excited for this, but I'm just a little skeptical. I did some research on the company, and they don't have any website / facebook / linkedin / twitter pages, I can't seem to find the owner of the company on LinkedIn either.\n\nI found out that they filed to become a business on December 31st, 2013, so they have only been around for 6 months. They have an office suite at a local corporate park, where I will be going tomorrow.\n\nThere is an interview in the morning, then I go out with a salesman and probably do some kind of test run / training day, then back for a final interview at night. I don't think there is any compensation for this, but I am fully aware and okay with that, best case scenario I have a new job, worst case scenario I didn't sit around playing with FL studio and trying to market my soundcloud all day long.\n\n**I'm looking for people who have worked this type of job, or had this type of experience to fill me in on what I should expect from the interviews and from the day itself. How do these people in these types of jobs usually get paid, and is it normal for this advertising agency to have so very little web presence?

No kissing, no cuddling, no hugs, no hand holding, no arm around, no sleeping next to each other and finally no sex. She even doesn't like it when I talk to her and constantly shh's me. All she wants to do is sleep. This is irritating and probably the worst thing about my own situation. I'm an extremely affectionate person and she won't have any of it at all. \n\nI don't understand anxiety. I've only dealt with depression and when I had it, it wasn't super severe, I knew that if I took my meds things would be OK, and that's just what I did. Trying to get her to take her meds is a god damn nightmare. She refuses to help herself and would rather wallow in her own misery. \n\nAs anyone dealt with an SO with anxiety and/or depression?
