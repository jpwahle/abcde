Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 20, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\nAs a change of pace, I am actually looking for two Specific Fandoms that I feel that I really want to RP. I usually post a generic post saying about how I am open to doing a hell of a lot of genres, which is still true, don't worry! Just this time, I'm looking for one or the other fandoms at the moment.\n\n\\- HALO : Halo has always been a number one fandom that I have loved to Rp in the past but have never really found someone perfect for the role. So for this RP, I can do alot of different themes\/pairings so long as, said later, that the characters are indeed OC.\n\n\\- Destiny : Exactly the same as Halo, I absolutely love this game. To the point where I am a Lore Nerd as well as a Sherpa. I would love to find someone who would want to delve into the stories behind the game and the hundreds of years of lore prior to the first game beginning.\n\nAs always, here are my preferences:\n\n\\- I'm currently 20, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs are NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n\\- I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male\/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least.\n\n\\- I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character.\n\n\\- Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nWith this being a specific post, I also ask of the following\n\n\\- Know what you're RPing! This seems like a common factor but please, just know what you're RPing. I dont mind explaining complex things but I dont want to have to turn around and explain what an ODST is or what a Warlock is. Please know what these fandoms are and have \\*some\\* knowledge about them, even if it's just the games.\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon! Thanks again for taking the time to read my post!

Basically, I have no motivation for absolutely anything. All the hobbies that I had I don't do them no more. In the morning, I have to fight with myself to get myself up from bed and usually it mentally and physically hurts after those fights. I've been seeing a therapist but I don't see how she can help me. Also, I have social anxiety, depression (obviously) and I'm EXTREMELY introvertic person. I've been isolated and in my own world since I was 9 and got my first computer. Due to that I have no social skills and believe it or not, I have no friends. So I've been having 24\/7 suicidal thoughts and I feel extremely empty. I have no feelings. I'm just.... I don't even know. Like, I've never... Been like this before? Felt isn't the right word, because I literally feel nothing. I just really don't want to exist and school is just killing me. I tried to tell my mom about this, but she thinks it's the computer. Also, I've cut myself and attempted suicide a few times. I feel like something is controlling me or taking me over because a few times I've almost jumped in front of a car. Literally like starting to run and jump but stop at the last moment. I am very confused right now. I feel nothing, I see no future for myself, and I'm just like a motionless....

I've bounced between Colorado and Mississippi, and Denver was a very nasty city when I was a kid (crime, smog, more crime) so the Denver Broncos never had much appeal. I, rather arbitrarily, decided to back a new team, so I picked the team my dad complained about the loudest, that seemed to win everything every year. It was 1996. I could not have picked a worse year to join a bandwagon. But I'm stubborn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've always dreamed of knocking off the Patriots, and romantically sweeping in a new football dynasty. I'm far, far from alone in this fantasy. Tony Romo seemed like a successor to Aikman, and any year was going to be THAT year. I've felt entitled to it. We're SUPPOSED to be that team, and all the other fans still act like we're that team. But it never came. We always feel like we're supposed to finish with 10+ wins, we're supposed to go deep in the playoffs, and we're entitled to a superbowl team every year. When I put these pieces together, it's made understanding Dak Prescott in the salary cap era a lot easier to bear. Do we have the best coach in the league? Nope. Do we have the best offense? No. Defense? Debatable. But if you think about how there is one team out of 32 that has cracked the salary cap problem, with Machiavellian efficiency and callous, and only one team that year after year can expect a deep playoff run without tanking a season, it's pretty crazy to put those standards on us. We were that team in another era, but things are different now and while we have the most valuable organization in sports, like everything else about our team, our management is pretty good. Draft scouts, spreadsheets, stats vs intangibles paradoxes, coaching...everything outside the cap isn't New England-level, but still an elite organization that produces a team that can see the playoffs more often than not. And I can like that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur QB isn't Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Aaron Rodgers, nor Peyton Manning. (Two of those guys have won the big game only once, mind you.) But, the Browns have had THIRTY starting QBs since 1999. Out of the last couple hundred QB's to start in the NFL, I've stopped getting down about not having one of those in the top 2%, and start feeling really good about our guy that's clearly in the top 10-15% (top 20-30? That's a very big group but he fits without controversy). I feel good about having one in the top 5% that's Hall of Fame bound. That is a testament to our very good front office. We blow it on draft picks from time to time. We are even worse at free-agency (Nolan Carroll anyone?). We had to have 8 dudes at camp to find out Tank was actually Hercules. But we are down-right elite at getting value in later-rounds and UDFA's. This allows us to overpay and outright miss on some dudes, because we're a great organization. Not the best, not dynastic, but the kind of moves that would tank a franchise are the ones we make all the time. We just rebound really well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Say what you will about Cowherd, Skip, etc.](https:\/\/www.foxsports.com\/watch\/the-herd-with-colin-cowherd\/video\/1407170627537) They're all saying the same stuff essentially. Lower expectations from dynastic stardom, and appreciate that we have a solid functional team year in and out. MOST organizations cannot say that, and some haven't even had more than a couple good seasons in two decades.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"cowboys","subreddit_id":"t5_2re7g","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/cowboys","subreddit_subscribers":64258,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"How I learned to stop worrying and love our very good team","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cowboys\/comments\/abd1yd\/how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love_our_very\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I haven't changed ANYTHING else about my lifestyle otherwise, however I now seem to have stabilized at 190 (was 195 in October and had a five pound breast reduction).

I started using hormonal birth control when I was 18 because I had terrible PMS cramping and occasional the first day or two of my period was really heavy. At the time, I weighed in the 130s. Since I started BC my cramping has gotten significantly better and my periods are much lighter. Like I said, on depo I haven't had a period and thus no PMS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really love not having a period, but I hate how much weight I've gained.

She got angry and started spiting out drunken insults, i didn't mind it as much since she was drunk.\n\nThen she told me to go kill myself by jumping out of the window, this really hit me, since i struggle (although i'm in a much better shape now) with depression and suicidal thoughts. \n\nAt the same time, her boyfriend wanted to go to the Copacabana beach see the fireworks, for SOME reason, she wouldn't let him out, stood in front of the door and hid the keys, this contributed to the escalation of the situation and she snapped.

I'm 27, AMAB, autistic, and I've been wrestling with depression pretty much since puberty. I live alone because my family were shitty and toxic. I am jobless because the game industry is terrible, and I'm friendless IRL because I live in a uni town where the only popular hobby is getting drunk as hell. (I'm teetotal and have bad family experience with alcohol, so that's a huge no.)\n\nI'm posting here because in the last few months I've come back to the gender question. I started questioning back in 2016, when I finally had room to think after ghosting my family. I remember trying on a dress when I was like 17 and getting caught by my sister, which naturally became the butt of a joke. Then there was the stereotypical shit like roleplaying online as a catgirl which felt really good and honestly sort of still does.\n\nBut yeah in 2016 I tried to really push for transitioning. I bought myself clothes, picked out a name for myself, and made connections in the local LGBT community. For a few months things seemed to be okay and I was feeling better about myself, but then the whole thing fell apart. My girlfriend dumped me out of nowhere and also mentioned she'd never loved me at all, and I failed to make any real friends among local trans people because there was a heavy expectation to get wasted and go to their secret drug parties.\n\nI ended up backsliding into egg mode and lingering on a vague nonbinary idea. I chickened out of my gender clinic appointment at the last minute and it'll be over a year before I see them again if I try now. Unsurprisingly the last year has been rougher than usual for me mentally and at my worst I've had to wrestle with suicidal stints.\n\nI'm in an annoying position because I feel like a stereotype. I like all the typical closeted-trans-girl stuff. I like cute dresses and want headpats. I fantasise about wearing pretty outfits and lingerie and being a catgirl. But at the same time it all feels so unreachable because I spent most of my childhood getting bullied by my sisters about my looks. I wouldn't be able to handle all the upkeep it'd take to look good as a girl anyway, so is it even worth bothering? And if it turns me on as well does that mean it's just a fetish?\n\nIt's so much fucking easier on the internet. I don't need to worry about having enough spoons to eat or shower or how much sleep I managed to get. I can be the cute girl I want to be on command. But even then I feel like I'm lying to people because behind all the cuteness I'm living in an ugly dude flesh prison.\n\nI wish I could just upload my brain to a computer and leave my body behind. I'm not capable of taking care of it anyway and all it does is piss me off.\n\nI'm not sure what I'm hoping to get in response to this. I'm so tired of not knowing who I am or what I want or what it's okay TO want. I guess I'm hoping for one last push that'll help me figure out where I stand one way or the other.\n\nSorry if this post rambled on for way too long. Getting all this out of me has been pretty tough. If you're still reading this far, thank you, and I hope 2019 treats you well.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MtF","subreddit_id":"t5_2ub9j","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/MtF","subreddit_subscribers":52329,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AMAB, possibly egg on the verge of re-cracking, looking for support","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MtF\/comments\/abdbi9\/amab_possibly_egg_on_the_verge_of_recracking\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

Do I dare say that it has been the worst year in my life? Maaaaybe. Perhaps it hasn't, but I guess if there were worse ones I just wasn't mature enough (currently 19 by the way) to notice.\n\nI don't think I've ever had a year filled with more boredom than this one. Last year I met some people who are now in my main friend group. I also started college, and you know, not the most fun thing ever, but it was still something new and I quickly made friends there, it was the first year in which I reaaaally got hooked up on anime (which did cause me to neglect some activities with my friends at times, but oh well, I don't regret watching as much anime as I do) and while not the most dynamic year I've ever had, I'd say it was a positive year overall.\n\nAnd well, 2018 had some stuff coming. My dad died on April 2018. I was never super attached to my dad and I'm not really a sensitive person, though I do miss him and I definitely believe that it did take its toll on me somehow. Because of all that however, my mother has a lifelong pension and I get almost 1000 euros per month til I'm 25. This has allowed me to buy a good computer and more recently a Switch, among other things, but it just... I don't know, it's not like I regret buying the stuff I did (though at first I did manage my money quite poorly), but like, I didn't EARN this money, it's awesome that I have savings that I don't have to work for for quite a long time, but at the same time it reaaaally feels like I don't deserve it.\n\nAs for college... In one single trimester I've already skipped more classes than in the whole previous year. I don't like it one bit, every single class bores me to death and overall I just wish I wasn't doing any of this and was just at my house playing videogames. However, there's a pretty decent possibility that I'll move to Madrid this year to start a new career which definitely looks promising, and I really don't mind having to start over from the beginning. But there's always the possiblity that it might not happen and I'll have to deal with the career I'm at for 2 more years.\n\n\nThis year I've literally not met ANY new people. At all. I did talk with one of the friends from my main group for a few months, but ever since around late September it's stopped happening daily and it's more like bi-weekly. I'm never excited to go out and when I do I don't have much to say. Two of my friends are currently living in Seville due to college and the friend I mentioned earlier is from Seville as well, but, despite the fact that some of my other friends visit them from time to time and they also come back every so often, I've never paid them a visit. While every single one of my friends seem to make advances in their love\/sex life and overall get better at socializing, I'm just kinda... stuck not really doing anything.\n\n\nLast but not least, many things just don't get me as pumped as people would expect me to. Went to an anime convention in Seville with a friend, the biggest we've both ever been to, and my friends who live there were cosplaying, but I wanted to leave early anyway (partly due to the fact that, since they were cosplaying, they would constantly stop as they were asked by people to take photos with them and that would have prevented us from doing stuff at our own pace) and was only mildly interested in general. A bit over a week ago I went to Berlin with my sister and my mom (first time my mom and I have ever been abroad) and it was... not as fun. I even got yelled at by my sister for being bored. Of course there were things I liked, but it really wasn't enough. Most of the times I go out it doesn't take too long before I want to go back home and into my room and play games, watch anime, watch videos, whatever. I even prefer texting to actually seeing someone in person, because I honestly believe that that's enough, that I don't have to see them every week.\n\nIt's just such a huge load of feelings and thoughts I've had throughout the year that I wouldn't be able to explain them all, but that's the general idea. I really don't know if I want advice or what. but I guess something would be appreciated.

You gals were so helpful and I am thankful for that. However, more than a few people told me... I am being used.\n\n\nSo let me backtrack. I am 23, she is 19. I have known her since she was 17 and I 21. (Since May 2017). The moment I saw her, I was infatuated. I needed her. Something about her just made me want to hold her and touch her. She isnt like a model, or super sexy, but something about her just gets to me.\n\nTurned out we get on like old friends, we went to the beach a week after we met and we ended up having sex after being together for 8 hours. She was the one who initiated. \n\nSo everything went well for a few months, she told me she didnt want to date, fine. She had just gotten out of a relationship. We went out all the time and I saw her almost every day. Then, in august, she got back with her ex. Everything changed.\n\nSomehow he found out that we slept together, actually he asked her. He hated me. He didn\u2019t want her to see me at all. She quit talking to me so much. She still came over,  nothing like that changed between us. Just phone convo. She didnt listen to him, kept me a secret.\n\nShe moved 5hrs away in december for college. Things got way worse. She only hung out with him, so she very rarely would text me. If I texted her, it was rare id get a response. The best way to talk to her was (is) to schedule a phone call time.\n\nFast forward to last month, we end up sleeping together again, finally. Even though she is with her old BF. Yup she cheated on him. He doesnt treat her right, at all. Ignores her. She said she hadnt had sex in 3 months, thats alot of pent up sexual energy for a teenage girl.\n\nAnyway, yeah she says im not her type. Idk. I love her. I really hope one day she might see... she knows I do. Im seeing her this week.

I'm 28 years old. This is my a brief outline of my life.\n\nI had a relatively good childhood. My Father was an alcoholic (beer) and would have angry outbursts on occasion. It molded me to be a bit passive and a \"walking on eggshells\" kind of mentality. I was always afraid I would upset him, or not do something perfect. There was a lot of pressure on me. I grew up with a brother and two sisters. One sister being 2 years older than me. She and I were extremely close.\n\nWhen I was 16, shy, vulnerable in high school; my 17 year old sister was killed by a drunk driver going the wrong way on the highway. My family was devastated. I withdrew, and succumbed to peer pressure because I had no friend group, I needed friends at this point I thought. So I started to hang with the potheads. I smoked weed almost every day for years. This is where it all began.\n\nAt age 17 I walked into our bathroom and opened a drawer, I found 120 40mg Oxycontin pills. I took 2. The guilt I had was unreal. I snorted half of one of the pills and that guilt vanished. I gave 1 to my best friend. We were fucked. I stole pills from my Mom for 1.5 years before breaking down and telling my parents what happened. They still loved me and sent me to a very nice inpatient rehab center. I finished treatment and I was back in control of my life. My family began to heal a bit more and things seemed to be going well. \n\n1 year later I relapsed on Oxycontin. I went to treatment again. I got out. This is when things got really bad. I went to my family physician that I had been seeing since I was a baby. I lied about ADHD and anxiety and I got him to prescribe me adderall and xanax. Over about 8 years I got him to raise the dosage to 90mg of Adderall and 6mg of Xanax a day. I would run out of medication after 2 weeks, go back to him and tell him I wanted to try a lower dose. I would do the same thing, go back and say it wasn't work, and get the dosage increased. \n\nI was driving myself insane. At age 24 my Father committed suicide. I was there when he shot himself. I called the police on him because he was drunk and he was court ordered to be sober. He panicked, ran outside, the cops got there and went looking for him and when they yelled out for him, I heard the gunshot.\n\nThis is unbelievably devastating.  My girlfriend at the time stayed by me, tried to help. 1 year later we broke up because I was such a mess and so lost. She couldn't fix me. This is when heroin entered the picture. I overdosed multiple times, I should be dead. I lost countless jobs. My own Mother would not allow me in her home. \n\nThen, in April of 2018, I tried to commit suicide. I failed. I was living with my best friends parents at the time. They would not allow me to return to their home. My mother would not let me live with her. I went to the psych ward, homeless, scared out of my mind.\n\nIt was at THIS POINT, that I made a decision. I decided that NO MATTER HOW HARD, NO MATTER HOW PAINFUL; I would succeed. I put ALL of my trust in the doctors and therapists. They got me on the right medications, walked me through therapy. I lived at the Salvation Army for 3 months. This experience taught me how to persevere. I got a temp job with a political campaign committee and made enough money to get my own place. I now have an amazing full time job with benefits, vacation pay, and a 401k. My relationship with my Mother, Brother, and Sister has been restored. I love spending time with them, and them with me.

But not like most other people have. I often catch myself fantasizing about her in ways most guys wouldn't. \n\nI like to speculate that behind all her fame and her pretty face there's a dirty, lustful and kinky Dominatrix hungry to have her desires fulfilled by the perfect slaveboy. \n\nAnd I want that slaveboy to be me. \nMy name is Chris, I'm 18. I am 6'1, I have short-meduim length brown hair and blue eyes. I have a fit body with a slim yet toned build. Making my muscles slender but defined. I'm innocent and laid back in personality. I'm no fighter and can be quite easily overpowered. \n\nI'm a very kinky boy with many kinks that include; Pegging, tease, denial, pussy eating, bondage, rough sex, foot fetish, some CBT, hidden public and impact play... those are just some of my favorites. You don't have to common kinks with Me, I'm happy to play to your own kinks, within my limits. \n\nSpeaking of, I only have three hard limits which are scat, gore and feminization. Apart from those she can go wild on me in just about any way she likes.\n\nI'm hoping to do a roleplay where Emma takes me as her own. Breaking me into her slave and using me for her pleasure. All while behind the scenes of her busy celebrity life. On the outside I could be her new boyfriend or assistant\/agent. Or perhaps I go unseen by the public world entirely and remain her little dirty secret back at home. Please let me know what dynamic would suit you, or suggest your own. \n\nRegardless of the scenario I do want this roleplay to have a good plot. I like having a good story in the roleplays that I do and creating a dynamic between characters that is more than just sex. Don't get me wrong there'll be plenty of smut in this roleplay, but I don't want it to be constant, otherwise it'll get boring. Build up is great, I love building up towards the smut as that makes it so much better, I don't need heaps and heaps of it but I would like a decent amount of buildup into the smut. \n\nI'm very much open to putting this story together and then playing it out. Input from my partner is always welcome. \n\nI am also open to having you play other celebrities if Emma isn't your kind of girl. \n\nThanks for reading.\nIt would be great to be able to find someone to do this with and really hope I do find someone. \nI accept all who respond regardless of experience or interests, as long as you're playing dominant I'll accept you. So Please don't hesitate to respond and message me if this interests you at all.\n\nMy kik is Chrisdo999\nLooking forward to finding a partner for this.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DirtyKIKRoleplay","subreddit_id":"t5_3kem5","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/DirtyKIKRoleplay","subreddit_subscribers":4954,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I want to be dominated by Emma Watson (Open to other celebrities aswell)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DirtyKIKRoleplay\/comments\/abdm2v\/i_want_to_be_dominated_by_emma_watson_open_to\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I read a [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/atheism\/comments\/ab9raf\/nothing_has_reinforced_my_atheism_more_than\/) and I wanted to comment, but my thoughts became too long so I thought I'd make my own post. Shout out to \/u\/the_black_shuck (the OP) in hopes they read this.\n\nPeople seem to be so confused or torn about atheist topics and reading things here have made me feel so lucky to have felt like I have understood things since my mid 20s (I'm 34 now). I hope some of the experienced people on this sub can poke some holes in my arguments and maybe help me to learn.\n\nI grew up in a Methodist and then southern Baptist family and when I lost my faith as a teenager one of the first things that made sense to me was that there is no such thing as a soul. Not in a literal cosmic sense anyway. Once I settled on that everything else fell apart. I've even noticed how fantasy and magic all depend on the concept of a soul. Without it everything seems so dry and mechanical. I find the boringness of reality to be so liberating. Once I was comfortable with a total lack of anything mystical I felt so much more secure in my own skin and connected to all other physical things. We are literally made of stars after all.\n\nThen I had thoughts on life and death and the point of existence. I enjoy existential topics so I've enjoyed the shows and YouTube series based on the topic. I came around to \"life\" being more of a concept than a physically real thing. I am alive in the same way fire or an economy are alive. You can grow a chunk of my flesh in a lab. There is no magic there. I'm just lucky to participate in this existence. I've been lucky in so, so many ways in my time on this little planet.\n\nSo, an optimistic nihilist point of view on existence led to thoughts on suffering. Suffering is our perception of entropy in so many ways. Existence makes you vulnerable to unavoidable destruction. If fire is alive in any stretch of the definition then it is in a constant state of suffering. Constantly consume or die. To suffer is to live and I don't mean that in a depressing way. Suffering makes me strong. My tolerance to suffering allows me to be strong for others. My constant exposure to suffering has allowed me to endure more and empathize with others. I see difficult people like gym equipment for my character. Give me the pain so I'll be stronger in the future.\n\nThe brains of intelligent life filters the raw experience of reality. They create a concept of self because it is an advantage. An abstract concept of identity leads to the idea of a soul which naturally leads to gods and fantasy. Religion is a rich tapestry of culture that has blossomed over the eons because of our complex brains. In that way organized religion really does have a great deal in common with American football and politics and the music industry. We create these things because we are the smartest and most social monkeys there are.\n\nI'll leave you with some quick stories. When I was about 10 years old I scooped up a big net of tad poles and dumped them into a bucket of water I found in the garage. I went to find a friend and when I returned I found my Dad scowling at me and saying, \"How did you not smell the bleach?\" He dumped the bucket onto the driveway and I saw a couple hundred dead and dying tad poles I had innocently killed. Later when I was maybe 14 I went bait shrimping with Dad and once we had a big cooler full of them we camped by the river. I spent two hours popping the heads off all of the shrimp. I can still remember them quiver in my hand as I took their lives. Now I enjoy homebrewing beer. I routinely grow a couple hundred billion yeast cells so I can force them to work for me. Then, I throw them away or drink them. I'm always thinking about the value of one life versus another and how the uncaring universe will crush us all without noticing and it makes me feel so very special to have the life I do. Aliens could fly down and pop my head off and I wouldn't necessarily feel any malice toward them. Shit just happens and that is cool with me.\n\nOh, and I'm not some kind of sociopath. I've retained my morals and am one of the kindest people I know. Integrity and empathy are very important to me. Giving you my food while I go hungry is what I call strength.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/atheism","subreddit_subscribers":2357943,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Thoughts on Life and Suffering","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/atheism\/comments\/abdn9m\/thoughts_on_life_and_suffering\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

As part of this my dad decided to put up Ring wifi cameras. In case you don't know what Ring is, you can find the info [here](https:\/\/ring.com\/?medium=tsa&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAmafhBRDUARIsACOKERNLHGSL5A1Up9aoPYIlJfCouFzqstpvf_Rn4CDTUldOX0TO97LVs8QaAgE1EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds). There is one set up as our doorbell, one looking at the back gate and one overlooking our entire back yard. Unfortunately, I do not have access to footage from these cameras because my dad has the app on his phone which is the only way (that I know of) to access footage from these cameras.\n\nMore background wowee: one night my dad was out of town and I was taking out the garbage and my dad used the voice feature from the app on his phone to scare the shit out of me and we had a good laugh about it.\n\nAnyway, now to the real spooky stuff: about a week or two ago I was taking out the garbage again and this really loud static started blasting from the speaker of the camera above our back gate. Initially, it freaked me the fuck out because  one of my greatest fears is being watched without my knowledge. Anyway after getting really scared, I forgot about it shortly after and went on with my life. After watching the video mentioned above, I got kinda freaked out again considering the possibility our wifi cameras are vulnerable. There are none inside the house, but it is still kind acreepy to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan anyone provide some advice or speculation as to what happened? sorry I don't have much information, but hopefully you enjoyed my little story haha\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ncheers everyone &lt;3","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"NightmareExpo","subreddit_id":"t5_3mmqt","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/NightmareExpo","subreddit_subscribers":9775,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Security Camera Story","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/NightmareExpo\/comments\/abdts6\/security_camera_story\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I'm looking for some guidance or ideas or experiences... I've tried to get help moving with Vocational Rehab but they were as useless with that as they were with helping me find work and we parted ways. I checked with a disability advocacy group but their advice was to get on the waiting lists and wait. Which I have been doing. For the past 2 years and change.   \n\n\nMy situation: I'm 33, single\/no kids, disabled (bad leg from almost losing it to an infection\/physical limitations) but capable of being independent with the proper tools, and I live with my parents. Living with my parents is not a great situation as it's not a great place for my emotional\/mental health (anxiety, depression, OCD, introverted) and I love them but they are unintentionally toxic. I also live in a very rural town and my parents' house is literally in the middle of the woods down a dirt road. I don't have any access to mental healthcare that would be feasible for me to travel to, I have a car but on day's I can't drive there's no public transport\/uber\/taxi\/lyft\/any kind of delivery. The job market is incredibly hard and my city and the surrounding areas are a huge clique so honestly even if I had proper health, I think it would be nearly impossible to find a job here. Since I live with my parents and don't pay rent, I make the federal minimum for my disability so saving has proven to be impossible between larger expenses like car parts, a mattress, and those things that pop up because life be that way.  \n\n\nI need to get out of here if I'm ever going to do better for myself, take care of myself, and be in an environment where I can not only take proper care of myself, but thrive. Get out from under this constant cycle of depression and anxiety and feeling useless because of and environment where I'm not respected, considered, or given privacy. I just keep running into people throwing their hands up in the air because they don't know what to do or can't help me. I've been told I'm low priority because I have a roof over my head and don't have kids. Honestly... with being stuck here with no end in sight has me feeling entirely hopeless. I'm not taking care of myself properly at all because I just can't muster the energy\/will to do so while I'm feeling like things will never change.  \n\n\nI live in Lake City, MI and while I'm open to moving anywhere in state that gets me in a better (read non-rural, away from my family) area, I would love to move to Alabama (Mobile area hopefully) where my best friend and strongest support moved to. I can find even LESS information regarding moving to a different state while disabled. The HUD offices tell you to show up in person and I don't have the finances to travel there. I've never moved, I've never lived on my own even as an able bodied person so I don't even have that experience to draw from. Even if it's not ideal, I just need out of here. I can move again and get to where I want to be in time, I don't mind if that takes more time and multiple steps, I'm just staring at this new year and thinking about being stuck here in this horrible limbo for ANOTHER year and I just want to scream or cry or hyperventilate or all of it. Winter and the holidays are already hard on me mentally\/emotionally but dang. I can't bare the thought of yet another year with no progress after wasting so much time with two years of Vocational Rehab that did barely anything for me.  \n\n\nWell, thanks for listening. Any advice or experience or direction no matter how small is much appreciated.

We have similar professional interests, hobbies (reading, writing, music, working out, cooking), political views, and thoughts...even our personalities are the same, in that we're emotional and impulsive at times. The chemistry is insane, and I've never felt so much for someone in my life. (My previous boyfriend had been kind but the chemistry and commonalities were not there.) I'm 23 and the new guy was 32.\n\nWe spent two weeks spending nights at each other's places and divulging our deepest secrets. Then, two nights ago, he sat me down after cooking dinner and told me he wanted something \"casual.\" By this, he meant that he wouldn't see other people and didn't want me to see other people without his knowledge. He also said there was no possibility of a relationship because his career needs his full attention. This upset me, even though I needed to recover from my previous relationship, because I needed the hope of being together for real someday.\n\nIt was a bomb dropped. That night we stupidly got super stoned, which triggered my anxiety (I suffer from mental illness, including anxiety). We were intimate and I felt so much affection for him and kept picturing us continuing, with me hoping that he would change his mind -- which would be a complete horror show. I was so confused and hurt that I couldn't sleep, and then I left at 3 am, saying that I'd never come back. He begged me to stay and discuss it more in the morning; my panic attack made me say crazy things, like \"your life is a mess\" and \"I really like you.\" Then I fled his house into the dark.\n\nBasically, I dumped him on his birthday in the middle of the night.\n\nI've tried to apologize over text and ask him whether we can talk. I want to say that I've given it thought, and that a casual thing is perfect for me at the moment (though I'd eventually want commitment). But he has been brushing me off, saying that everything's okay.\n\nWhat do I do now? I feel awful about my actions, which were immature and hurtful. Our bond was deep enough that I miss his company, even as a friend. Also, there's a chance I might see him at work, which makes it even more imperative that I have an adult conversation with him. I can't live with the fact that his last memory of me is of me squatting on his floor having a panic attack...\n\nTL;DR: After my 'fling' said he wanted something casual, with no hope of a relationship, I panicked and walked out on him and now I regret it, even though I am also not ready for a relationship.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationships","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/relationships","subreddit_subscribers":2251857,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I (23f) found out the guy I was seeing (32m) wanted something casual, panicked, and walked out.

I let loose and let her know how I was feeling and that it really was messed up that things ended so suddenly. She tried to flip the tables on me but I wasn\u2019t letting myself and proved her wrong on the things she was faulting me for.

I casually came out on insta, where most of the people I connect with are friends and not so much family members, but I never bothered making a big coming out post on Facebook, because I just didn't care and didn't want to make a huge deal about it. I told everyone I talked to directly (including my spouse) that it wasn't a secret, I was out of the closet, and they could tell anyone they want and asked them to please use they\/them pronouns and gender neutral terms for me from now on. I know my spouse is not at all shy about it and has had discussions with her family and many of my extended family members that she talks to more than I do. I've had some conversations recently where I expressed that I have no clue who in my family actually knows, even though I'm not shy about posting trans related stuff online (and using \"we\" when I do), or if anyone in my family misgenders me to others when talking about me. They live on the other side of the country, I see them like once or maybe twice a year at most. Well, last night I caught a couple exchanges my spouse was having with my mom on the phone (I was sick and half passed out on the couch) and asked her today what they were talking about. Apparently my spouse pressed my mom on the subject and she admitted they have not told ANYONE in my family, they do in fact not use my pronouns and she gave a bunch of excuses about how THEY don't have a problem with it, but don't know how it would be received by others. My family isn't conservative, I don't see many of them that often, I'm 40 and have my own family and don't really care what they think, my mom knows all this. It just sort of confirmed my suspicions, when after I came out and I gave my parents resources to educate themselves and months later when she came to visit us, my mom claimed she never read them because she couldn't find the links I sent her, so I texted them to her on the spot. My dad was supportive when I came out, but in the briefest way possible (txt that read: I'm happy for you, I still love you\") and has literally never asked me a single follow up question or mentioned it since, though he did misgender me when wishing me happy birthday recently, which I corrected him on. I just suspected maybe they nodded their heads and then decided never to bring it up, since I'm not there to confront them about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo anyway, I made a not quite coming out post, because I'm out already...but a \"coming outer\" post on Facebook tonight. Just kind of looking back at the year, explaining some of the emotional significance of coming out, how I chose to do it (and how I chose not to do it in certain ways), the events that lead up to it and what's changed for me since then. I think I've pretty much cut out all the toxic people from my life at this point, so I only got positive and supportive replies. Maybe it will spark some conversations with my parents and they'll talk about it some more and make more effort now, but if not I can't really control that.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"NonBinary","subreddit_id":"t5_2vcez","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/NonBinary","subreddit_subscribers":17554,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Had to make a \"coming outer\" post on FB.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/NonBinary\/comments\/abecps\/had_to_make_a_coming_outer_post_on_fb\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

When ever I see my family they say that I'm doing great and that I'm on the right track, but whenever they say that in my head I always think, \" yea, but you don't know that I have a 2.5 gpa, which definitely won't get me into a grad school or potentially a job after school\". I'm scared that I just won't be able to find a career at all. I was also let go from a lab that I worked in for two years earlier this semester so that really didn't help with any of this worrying and doubt I have currently. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I am terrible at saving money, I currently have nothing in savings, and barely anything in a checking account, so I'm scared that I won't be able to afford literally anything at all ever, and have a place to live when out of college. I was let go from a lab earlier this semester so I really didn't have money coming in and was just running off what I had, all while trying to find a new lab to work in, but I never got hired for any of them. So I am worried that I won't be able to just pay for anything like next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother thing is that I'm worried I won't ever find anyone to be with. I am worried I won't date people and then find someone who I'll marry and potentially have a family with. So theres that as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I'm worried I wont be able to give anything back to my parents and turn out as someone who has a career, family, and a life. I just feel scared for everything in my life right now and about my future and yea its a great way to start the new year, by just being scared about everything.
