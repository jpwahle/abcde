Well I go and I look around and I see a girl alone she wasn't too bad so I was like hey if I saw this girl here and it's only been 10 min there must a whole lot prettier girls waiting so I don't talk to her.\n\n\n I walk around and I start to notice that all the cute girls have a chaperone like a parent or a brother or something and this is probably a hour in of me just walking around looking for a girl to mack at. So I start to get frusterated and start to go off on a rant in my head about how every girl has a chaperone and how come they don't go alone or with a friend instead lol.\n\n     And it's at this time that I lose it at first I was confident and really feeling it but after this rant I started to lose it and then I started thinking about school tommorrow and how it's going to suck (told my friends I was going to mack) how Chemistry is going to suck and just how much my life is gonna suck.\n\n\n\n Then I start thinking about this girl I like (have major oneitis for and it's been like 3 months and still haven't really talked to her.) and that threw me off I just started to compare these girls with her and one of them had similar hair to her and that also threw me off I thought it was her I got scared but I thought about approaching until she moved to the side and I noticed it wasn't her. \n\n         I saw a guy getting at this girl by this store and she seemed to like the conversation with him and that kind of made me want to step my game up but as I said that rant in my head later threw me off. \n\nI tried that eye contact thing with a couple of girls I would just stare at them one of them seemed interested because she looked back for a while and it was a serious stare not a creeped out stare. Another chick I looked at her in the eyes and she seemed a bit creeped out because I think I gave a serious stare but whatver.\n\n\n\n Towards the end I was done I just wanted to get out of there forget about this day and just go chill out. I went to a starbucks table it was chilly so the seats were cold. No one sitting down under a tree so it was dropping leafs. I see this girl and I see stare at her at her eyes she looks back and she looks at me for a bit. 1 minute later I'm looking at something else I think it was the people passing by. And I see her pretending to look behind me and then look at me and then look away.\nSo I was like if she looks at me one more time I will look back and we will lock eyes and I will just walk up to her and talk to her but she never looked back and my dad came and picked me up.\n   Before I left I noticed that this girl that I stared at earlier the day and she seemed sort of interested was being hit on by some guy. The guy didn't seem to be doing good he was talking then looking at her then stopping not to let her talk but just to stop and it was almost a akward silence and then he would go again talking. She was with what seemed some of her friends which is why I didnt approach because Im scared of approaching multiple girls at one time.\n\n\nSo my excuse is that the hot girls aren't alone or at least with one friend they are with their parents or the one that are with friends or alone are too old for me. I am 15 yea old sophomore so I try to look girls around my age.\n\n  One last thing there was this girl next to my table right before I was about to leave next to the other girl I mentioned abouve and I looked at her and she looked back but I think I stared to long and I passed the regular staring and made my way into the creeper \"staring at me look\" she didn't say that but I imagine something like that lol.\n\nWhat could I do to improve because Got damn this is not good at all not at all I mean like c'mon this aint good this ain't good. \nLast Last thing is it weird that I had a dream about this girl that I like she was like 10 year old and was with her 5 year old brother I was younger in the dream too (I don't know if she actually has a younger brother I'm not a \"stalker\") and I saw her through a fence and then I went to just go see her she was on a swing swinging back and forth and I just saw her and it was beautiful is this weird?","stickied":false,"permalink":"/r/highseddit/comments/48ddw0/so_i_go_to_the_mall_and/","num_comments":7,"id":"48ddw0","hide_score":false,"secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"media":null,"subreddit":"highseddit"}

{"name":"t3_48dg6r","selftext":"I feel like this is a bit unusual and it might get long, but I really need some kind of advice. Before I tell you the backstory, I'll start with the most important fact about this: I'm addicted to cocaine.  \n\nThe very first time I used coke was when I was 15. I started using it more often when I was 17 and now that I'm 19 I'm using it daily - when I go for a few days without using it, I get a very strong craving, but it doesn't make me feel sad or angry or anything like that. I'm very open about having used it in the past - my parents, psychiatrist and friends all know about it - but I can't bring myself to tell them that I *still* do coke, since they'll probably throw me into a rehab and I really, really really don't want to go through a full-time rehab program. I **don't want to stop** using cocaine, to be honest. And it's very, very cheap in my country - I pay 20BRL (5 USD) for a gram of coke (50 BRL/12 USD per gram when it's very good in quality) and I have a fairly high tolerance to it.\n\nThe thing is: I really haven't experienced any bad things in these years. Coke makes me happier, my self-esteem gets higher, I get more focused and creative, I do my chores on time, etc. I'm getting my bachelor's degree next year, I have very high grades, and I've managed to score two internships already - and I keep asking myself, why am I more successful now that I'm a fucking addict? I pay for the drugs with my own wage, so I don't feel guilty about using my parents' or friends' money neither do I steal things in order to sell them to buy coke. And since things have been looking up for a while now, why should I stop using it? \n\nI'm a very self-controlled person, too: I decided to stop smoking cold-turkey after two years, and I had no physical effects from withdrawal neither did I felt the need to have a smoke again - even though I hang out with smokers every single day. I've got prescriptions for both Xanax and morphine and even though I could use them recreationally, I don't and only use when I really need them. I'm a very rational person when it comes to stop doing things that are bad to me, but for me it's unreasonable to think that cocaine would be bad since my life has only got much, much better ever since I started using it (this is not a delusion, seriously - my relationship with my friends and family is much better now, I've been really dedicating myself to work and study, I've been feeling better about myself overall).\n\nSo, I really have no fucking clue of what I should do, honestly!! I can't seem to convince myself that cocaine will be harmful to me, but I also don't feel good about being a drug addict and I'm afraid that if I stop doing it, I'll stop being so dedicated to my job and basically everything else in my life - I'm very, very young, and I feel like I have a bright future ahead. Should I cut it cold-turkey and will I be able to do it? Should I \"replace\" it with some kind of similar drug, like Adderall (which I can easily get prescriptions to, since I have ADHD)? How can I keep myself from going to a rehab center?\n\nSo, really, *any* kind of advice or shared story would be very very much appreciated.

Up until a few years ago I used to be pretty fit and small, but developing more severe chronic illness made me really inactive and I didn't change my diet so I gained weight. I'm not overweight, but my body fat percentage is higher than I'd like it to be. I'm 5'7 and used to weigh around 60kgs. Last year I got up to 68kgs and was feeling really gross. As a result I tried to eat less and just ended up alternating between not eating enough, and eating too much. It was really hard to lose weight without restricting my diet, and when I didn't eat enough I of course wouldn't have any energy. I've heard that with CFS you really have to make sure you're eating enough calories throughout the day, but I hate counting calories and I don't want to accidentally over do it and end up gaining weight. On the other hand, my doctors have been wanting me to keep a food diary. \n\nI found out about the myfitnesspal app and decided to try it. I don't want this to sound like an ad for the app, but honestly it's one of the best things I've ever done for my recovery. It's really easy to just log in what I eat every day, and it tells me how many calories is in everything as well as good nutritional information. So I can keep a food diary and count my calories every day, in one go. And it's a lot easier than other forms of calorie counting. The app takes in information like what your goals are (losing/maintaining/losing weight) and exactly how many calories you need to eat every day to reach that goal in a certain amount of time. It takes out all the guess work, which is good for a brain foggy, clueless-about-weight loss individual like myself. \n\nSo now I'm actually eating enough calories every day, but I'm also eating more regular small meals, with more nutrition, and I'm way more conscious about my food because I'm recording it every day. Even though nobody sees it but me, I have a sense of accountability for my diet. And I know that I'm eating the right amount of calories so that I don't gain weight, which is not only good for my body but it puts my mind at ease and I'm way less stressed out about my diet. I'm now back down to 62kgs. \n\nDiet plays a big part in my recovery, and this app has really helped me get on track. The best part is how simple it is, which is essential for me given my daily energy levels. I have a feeling other CFS fighters will be having the same kinds of problems I've had, and might benefit from this too."}

Sarah also drunk texted another person in my friend group to hook up, but I don't want to expose that to all of her friends. There is now a tension between me being hounded and not wanting to expose Sarah who has every right to do her own thang.\n\n**Shorter Version:**\n\nRecently became better friends with a girl who is now loosely part of our group of friends. Her friends constantly pressure me to \"make a move\" on her despite receiving constant negative feedback (in terms of a relationship) at many junctures. The friends continue to egg me on to ask her out even though I was told by my roommate that she was drunk texting him to hook up. He barely knows her outside of seeing her at parties and turned it down. I want senior year to be fun while I still have time and getting vibes on two complete ends of the emotional spectrum is confusing and stressful.\n\nAm I within my right to tell her friends about her other secret hook up attempt? Is it an OK thing I can bring up with Sarah if we were hanging out? Is even thinking about this worth my time? I really do like her and I'd much, much prefer to have her as a friend than nothing at all if I make things hella uncomfortable, but at this point it's making me and only me uncomfortable.\n\n**Long story:**\n\nQuick bio: I'm 21 year old male, heterosexual senior at a brand name university, vastly inexperienced with adult relationships, and I'm insanely good at catching thrown grapes in my mouth.\n\nI've been in similar friendship circles with a girl named Sarah (not real name) for year+ now, but we never really knew each other or spoke to each other outside of maybe a game of flip cup. We would always be at the same parties, but we were friends with different hosts or something like that.\n\nEither way, at the beginning of the semester we hit it off at a party and she has since become a part of our group, but definitely still on the outside (i.e. I was the only male in the group that she would text outside of the groupme). She routinely came with us to pregames, parties, bars, etc., but still was mostly friends with me and the girls. I doubt any one of the other guys in my friend group even knows her last name.\nThroughout this time she would hit me up one weekday or so per week and invite me to hang out or invite herself over and I always got the sense that she liked me, but somehow conversation would always shift to some guy she was interested in or hooking up with or some kinda thing like that. Because of this, I never made any kind of advances thinking that this was her way simultaneously A) making conversation about her life and B) clearly expressing disinterest in a relationship. Obviously this is kinda a bummer for me, but that's just life so I tried and successfully tried not to care and not waste my time.\n\nNow two months later:\n\nLast Thursday: Start of the weekend for degenerates, class is over, you know we're hitting Chucks for happy hour. Sarah was still in class, so not in attendance. While hanging out in a booth, one of her friends floats the idea that she thinks Sarah had and has a thing for me and pretty bluntly suggests that I \"make a move.\" Her friends agree and pour it on to make a move. Nerve wracking, but dope.\n\nFriday: Start of the weekend for real humans, feeling good, confidence high, and ready to invite Sarah out for as much fun as we can pack into a weekend (which is a lot at this school). Go to a day drink, relax a bit, she ends up going to a sorority thing so we don't go out together Friday night.\n\nSaturday: same thing + a little homework (priotiries), afternoon drink and then a house party. Go through the motions, have fun, do party things or whatever and eventually Sarah goes MIA. Apparently got a text about another party and just dipped. Another hit, but that's not that uncommon of an occurrence here.\n\nIt wasn't until sunday morning when my roommate told me that at 3 or so AM, Sarah texted him asking but not asking to hook up (e.g.\"My bed is very comfortable\") and that he turned her down because he's on his own chase and just generally wasn't interested in a completely random one night stand. Good pal. To add to the apropos of nothing-ness of the hookup offer, my friend said that he didn't even have her phone number when she texted him and he had to ask who it was when she first texted him.\n\nI did not tell any of the girls about this as I don't feel as though that's right and honestly it was actually really nice of my friend to let me know about it. This has, however, led to a continual hounding from her and my friends to \"make a move\" and it's making me incredibly uncomfortable. I'm simultaneously getting negative vibes (in this sense not like debbie downer vibes) from Sarah while getting pressured by her friends.\n\nBeing as though this is my Senior year, I really don't want weird feelings and I want to have fun taking the fewest credits maybe of all time. Am I within my right to tell her friends about her other secret hook up attempt? Is it an OK thing I can bring up with her if we were hanging out? Is even thinking about this worth my time? I really do like her and I'd much, much prefer to have her as a friend than nothing at all if I make things hella uncomfortable, but at this point it's making me and only me uncomfortable.

I am 5'10\" and 271lbs so I am asking those muscles to do a lot! I just recently bought a new pair of shoes and they feel great so I am pretty sure I am good there. Is this normal especially for someone my size?

When my lower jaw is a bit towards the back, i hear a clicking sound(when I open and close my mouth), but there is less/not really any pain, yet it kinda doesn't look natural when I place my jaw like that. On the other hand, when I put my lower jaw a bit forward, my right side of the jaw(that side of TMJ) feels tight and i feel the inflammation of the muscle. Yet in that position, I kinda have a feeling that that is my normal jaw position because mostly my front teeth touch, and not the back ones (compared to the jaw being a bit back and having less pain). So, what do you guys recommend? Me trying to keep my jaw forward and try to go through the tightness of the right side of my jaw? Who should I talk to? Any tips? I don't really have headaches etc.. but the jaw stuff is starting to be annoying.

When I was a baby I had kidney problems, I haven't had an issue since (I am 20). Earlier this month I experienced sharp pain in my sides and had to leave work. It was very late and the only open place was the ER. I contacted a nurse line through my insurance and they urged me to go to the ER. When I was there the doctor thought it was a bladder infection, did a urine test, and found it was *not* a bladder infection. He then did a CT scan and found nothing. \nThe doctor then told me he was treating me for bladder infection, prescribed me antibiotics and VICODIN! for the pain, (a bit much if you ask me). This doctor, i might add, was extremely condescending the entire time and didn't spend even 5 minutes talking to me. This entire visit cost ~$4400. \n\nI saw a different doctor the next day, who actually listened to what I was saying and found that the problem was constipation. Seriously. Something the first doctor may have found if he had paid any attention to what I was telling him, or if he had used his brain instead of just trying to rack up bills for expensive procedures. \n\nI belive I should dispute this because 1.

I have been working with my current doctor for 1.5 years and today I finally opened up about my depression.\n\nIn the decade that I've struggled with these things, I've been totally emotionally scarred from doctors blowing me off in ER's and specialists telling me my pain is all in my head. I've lost jobs, friendships, relationships, and most importantly, self-confidence because I have felt hopeless. I'm not proud of this, but in order to be taken more seriously I stopped mentioning to doctors how terribly depressed, stressed, and shut down I've become due to chronic pain.\n\nToday I finally admitted to my doctor I trusted her enough and I was ready to look in to mental wellness. And she was completely over the moon. She's sending me straight to her trusted psychiatrist.\n\nI've pretty much exhausted all of the medication routes for psychiatric meds so I am pretty nervous.

Ive been dealing with porn from a very young age so up until last year it was apart of my regular life.At 10 it was staying up till 11 on cinemax and hbo watching the parody sex movies and Real Sex. It was interesting to me. (a kid who had to shield their eyes in a rated R movie if my mom saw breast)I only started masturbation at 14 and i lost my virginity that same year. It was easy to get an erection and keep it due to tv stuff being pretty softcore. \n\nAt 15 i got my first smartphone(this is where i knew  i fucked up) Started high school, friends tell you about porn,before you know it you are fapping more than you eat. Tried having sex again with a girl with giant breast. Couldnt get hard.thought i was nervous and shrugged it off. \n\nMonths pass and i try another girl. Couldnt do it, not even a flinch and  was like damn....i might have anxiety. Now if you have researched ped,you know it coincides with performance anxiety so i figured that's wht i had. I slowed it down,started drinking teas,taking calming pills and worked out (all while still fapping to porn). My confidence level was up but next time i tried to perform,same effect.  \n\nAt this point ,i was 17.Driving ,visiting girls thinking it'll go away,tried 3 more times and nothing but one month i didnt have my phone on nor a computer so i had no fap material.  I went from once or twice a day to maybe 1 every 2 weeks out if that month the second i got my phone turned on ,i texted a girl i knew wanted me so i visited and \"slayed the dragon \"without an issue. Me thinking i got my moji back,i went back to my routine (fucking porn stars visually  with my mind and hand)year and a half pass and I'm still in the same rutt. \n\nSo i finally researched my issue and walla,found no fap. I started this last year in 2015 around novermber. Deleted all my pics i had received from girls on kik,deleted browser bookmarks, and went cold for i think 10 or 14 days. I read the plus sides to nofap but at that point in my life i didnt read the withdrawl side.  The very second i felt depressed i fapped. Tried again made it to 5 days and started to maken up things in my mind.  \"Its just anxiety. Breath before sex and you'll be fine, fapping is fine\" or \" she wasnt your type anyway. I bet mia khalifa would make you happy rn\" those thoughts kept popping up until i read a story about a guy who almost killed his self because all his girlfriends left him from not being able to get it up. \n\n That motivated me even more so i made a new years resolution to stop in 3016......that lasted 11 days but only because my gf pressured me to have sex...so you know what i did (cut her off)so now I'm single and on track.  Today is 7 days and i really have no desire to fap. I want my 20s to be sex filled ,happy,and confident in college. No more laptop night caps. \n\"You can not achieve,if you do not believe\"~heartless0325\nUPDATE. Its day 12 and I'm feeling strong.talking to a new girl and we messed around a little but no sex  (my decision out of me not ranting to catch feelings this early)i got hard from what we were doing and it lasted a little longer than usual but still did not just stay.  \nHad tthe slight urge to fap to our not but didn't. I find myself humping my pillow or something at night though. I do not ejaculate but it feels pretty close.

I've been enjoying going through stick control, some drumeo videos and I've been trying to figure out some AC/DC. What I really want to do is start practicing double bass as a lot of music I'll want to play (years down the line :) incorporate it. I really like the idea of doing the stick control to accomplish this. Having played guitar for fifteen years I completely buy into and love the whole spiel of practicing with a metronome and starting slow. \n\nWith all that said - I can't, for the life of me, seem to physically play the double bass at any pace and with any pattern. What I mean is I try to do like RLRL at like forty bpm but I find myself slowly leaning back as my legs stutter and kick in every random direction. The sound isn't consistent and I basically look like I'm having a seizure. As a result my practice routine generally ends up being an hour and half of everything else then a half hour of trying to adjust my pedals and throne and watching videos wondering 'how the hell are they doing any of this?' \n\nI'm left wondering if this isn't just because I'm 6'4'' 210?

I've had other time booked off but for the last 2 years I haven't been able to take it. I've only had 2 days off but other employee, who's already taken 4 weeks, has booked off another 2 at the same time as me so I'll need to cancel my vacation to cover his. \n\nOkay fine, I still have my other time off later this year...oh wait, different employee who's also taken a ton of vacay already has booked yet more time off and even though I technically have seniority, I'm told I have to cover different employee during their endless time off because they've had a difficult year. Okay fine, different employee has had a shit year but, when I had a shit year (ICU, many follow-ups with many different doctors) I was discouraged from having the (mostly) elective surgery that would have put everything back the way it was pre-ICU.

Like so many Narcissists, any criticism, no matter how minor, directed at Nmom was taken as the most brutal, unwarranted personal attack by the most spoiled, ungrateful, sociopath of a child she was forced to raise (am not actually a sociopath) and she was an expert at dismantling every argument you had, no matter how accurate or cogent and making you seem like the aforementioned sociopath preying on a poor, overwhelmed, struggling single mother. As a result, I'm 30 and I put up with the most ridiculous shit because, in the back of my head, is a little voice that says \"maybe I am being ungrateful, maybe I am being unreasonable.\" How does that manifest at work? Simple, anytime I think about talking to management about why I'm flagging, about taking some time off, I think about what they might say to me to make it seem like I am unreasonable and ungrateful, \"It's true that you haven't used all your vacation time for the last few years but you still get weekends off and statutory holidays.\" And I can't think of anything to counter this and I just shut down...

I trust the advice here and believe that it is - I just want to calculate the difference so I can rest easy and get a better understanding of finances. The tax deduction sounds like free money and I would put the tax refund towards the loan after. \n\nThe calculation isn't that easy though. I have a number of loans, varying in amount and interest rate (as high as 6.74%). I want to use unbury.us to see what would change if I dump $5500 (the max IRA deduction) in my loans now. I need to contact my loan provider because online they list the minimum for all loans combined, without giving the specific minimums for each loan (although I know all extra is going toward the highest interest rate loan). \n\nI have briefly looked at an IRA and my understanding is the deduction is at my federal tax rate (The 'Federal Income Tax Withheld/'Wages,Tips, other Comp.') = 12.7% for me. So the Refund would be $5500*0.0127=$700.01 in my case. Then consider the potential growth of the IRA and... This is where I'm getting lost.

Since early childhood, in one way or another, I have learned that my primary purpose, duty, and asset as a woman is to be attractive aesthetically. Barbies and Disney princesses set the stage for the general preferred look in the culture I live in. Thin waist, light skin, long, thick hair, decent bust size, small feet, no blemishes, no body hair, good height (not too tall, not too short), nice smile, long eyelashes, and asymmetrical facial features. This is the type of woman that I know society finds worthy. I see her almost exclusively in film, television, magazines, and advertisements. Which is no secret, our society has beauty standards. Every society does.\n\nBut it goes deeper than just beauty standards. Everything about being a woman comes down to sex appeal. I've been bullied for being ugly and I've been catcalled while wearing a skirt. I've had a boss ask me not to wear makeup because I look \"slutty\" and I've had a coworker recommend I wear makeup to increase my popularity at work. I've been told to diet and I've been told to eat more. Women are under a lot of pressure to be perfect physically so we do our hair, shave our bodies, shop for relevant outfits... and then we get mocked if we do and if we don't.\n\nRape and sexual harassment have ties to sex appeal. As a woman, you are a walking sex object at all times. And often, that is regardless of how you look. Even children can have sexual appeal to certain people. At ten years old, I remember a stranger asking me what color my panties were on Neopets.com. The word \"teen\" is one of the most searched terms on porn sites and it makes my skin crawl. As a teen, I was so painfully unaware of my sexual appeal because I was growing into an intelligent, self-sufficient person and was sexually assaulted before I explored my own body. Someone explored my body before me. Which is a fairly common experience for women. As they say, one in four. (and I'm not gonna source that but in my opinion, if it's not one in four, it's more than that. We'll never know. So many cases go unreported.)\n\nIn certain parts of the world, women are required to cover themselves from head to toe so as not to inspire lust in men. And when they inspire lust anyway and are sexually assaulted, they are punished. In other parts of the world, women are free to wear what they want and then they too inspire lust in onlookers and are sexually assaulted. And those free women don't always speak up because they might also be punished. I don't think women inspire lust in those perpetrators. The lust is there from the start. Our culture grows and grooms the lust in rapists and sexual assaulter's by constantly affirming the idea that women are here for sex. \n\nSo much of the things that I've been told all come back to the fact that I am on Earth for sex. Save your virginity for marriage, wear long enough shorts to school so they don't kick you out of class, shave your legs/arms, don't walk home alone at night, smile when people talk to you, wear dress pants/suits to work so your coworkers take you more seriously, don't wear granny panties even if that is what makes you the most comfortable...\n\nI'm losing my mind! I want it to end! I can't get away from it. Ever. When I saw the new Star Wars in theaters, someone yelled \"Ew! She's old!\" when Carrie Fischer appeared on the screen and the internet freaked out at the fact that she aged. I've been terrified of aging since I turned seventeen. I'm 21 now and I feel like every day, I'm a little less attractive than I was. And I freak out because my worth as a human is going down. Now, I know it's not really but it can feel like it. So much.\n\nObviously the internet can't help you escape it. In every Reddit link I click on with a woman in the picture, one of the top comments is ALWAYS whether or not that woman is hot. If you post a picture of yourself, Redditors will either check your history for GoneWild posts or message you for pics of your body. \n\nFuck being a woman. I hate it. And I know men have issues as well but I really want to say that most men have an identity outside of being a sex object. And women overcome the fact that society wants one thing from us. But you never forget it. \n\ntldr: Being a women fucking sucks sometimes.\n\n","name":"t3_48dy5r","id":"48dy5r","num_comments":79,"permalink":"/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/48dy5r/if_i_could_choose_to_be_a_man_instead_of_a_woman/","stickied":false,"secure_media":null,"hide_score":false,"from_kind":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"media":null,"saved":false,"thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"subreddit":"TwoXChromosomes"}

Am I allowed to talk with you?\n11:33 AM\n \nJ: yea , how can we help you?\n11:33 AM\n \nS: oh good. I tried to ask in my ward, but it seems like as soon as I ask questions people get nervous and don't want to answer. :(\n   I recently read Rough Stone rolling\n   Are you familiar with that book?\n11:34 AM\n \nY: How old are you Stan?\n11:34 AM\n\nS: I am 45 yrs old this year.\n11:34 AM\n\nY: No we are not familiar we that book we are missionaries so we are not allow by the moment to read other books\n11:35 AM\n\nS: hmmm. well it is a popular biography of Joseph Smith. It is published by the church and sold in Deseret Book.\nAnyway, it just talks more about Joseph's life...\n11:35 AM\n\nY: And what is your concern about that?\n11:36 AM\n\nS: There were a lot of things that I had never heard before and that bothered me..\n   I grew up in the church all my life. I served a mission, temple attendance good, etc.\n   graduated seminary, attend my meetings every week, etc.\n   anyway, probably the thing that bothered me the most was the details of Joseph's involvement with polygamy.\n   I just finished reading the essays the Church published about this, and it only made me more concerned.\n   I don't know what to do...\n11:36 AM\n \nY: What concern you have brother?\n11:38 AM\n \nS: Well, one of the things that really bothered me was that Joseph constantly lied about being in polygamous relationships. He lied to his wife Emma a lot about it and it was clear that it really hurt her.\n   I'm having a hard time with the idea that he would lie to those closest to him.\n   Thank you for talking with me. I wish we were allowed to ask honest questions at church... Everytime I even start to imply I have doubts, people just shut down.\n11:39 AM\n \nY: We have read about that and we know a little bit about polygamy because we are serving here in temple square and we know because of Brigham Young and brother that is a really hard thing to understand, I do not know why members at your church do not talk about polygamy but back then it was a commandment from God  \n11:41 AM\n \nS: But if it was a commandment, then why would Joseph lie to Emma about it?\n11:42 AM\n\nS: I was trying to understand better and I started looking at all the referenced footnotes listed in the official church essays. Mostly they go to stuff gathered by the new Joseph Cmith papers project\n11:43 AM\n \nY: What we know is that Emma did not want Joseph Smith to practice polygamy because of course it was so hard, but the Lord told Joseph Smith that he needed to practice it, even an angel came to Joseph Smith to tell him to practice polygamy since he was not doing it because of his wife Emma \n11:43 AM\n \nS: When I started reading that stuff (again, official Church stuff, so I assume it is true), I just find more documents showing he lied to everyone about it.\n11:44 AM\n \nJ: well we invite you to ask in your local church leader and you can go to Church historian we know that they can help you to find in your question. \n11:44 AM\n \nS: hmm. I'm aware of the angel and flaming sword thing...\n11:44 AM\n\nS: man, I have talked with my leaders locally. they just tell me to \"doubt my doubts\" and all that.\n   I've even had my Elders quorum presidnet tell me that it was all a bunch of lies.\n   I showed him the stuff on the church website, and he still wouldn't believe me.\n   How can I have an honest conversation with my leaders if they simply deny that it even happened?\n11:44 AM\n \nY: Brother Stan we have meet so many members that start doubting about the church and you know what brother I know that for a reason we were born in this generation because it will be so hard for each one of us to understand why early members practice polygamy \n11:46 AM\n\nY: We believe you brother Stan because we have seen it as well \n   And it is hard to understand it because we don't practice it any more may be that is why leaders as well they don;t understand so we don't know the reason why \n   But one thing I can say to you brother those brethren have so many faith in the Lord that even though is was hard for them and their family to practice polygamy they obey the Lords commandments \n11:48 AM\n \nS: That also confuses me. When I read D&amp;C 132, it says pretty clearly that the whole idea of polygamy is eternal and it seems like we should be doing it. I absolutely don't want to do that (I think if I was told I had to get another wife I would leave the Church).\n11:49 AM\n\nS: Poor Emma was like the 24th person sealed to Joseph. I was always taught that they were close, but it seems like she was pretty far down his list.\n   I'm sorry to be asking you these things...\n   Do you think it really is ok for a prophet to lie about stuff like that?\n \nY: Brother I am only 20 years old and I still do not understand everything about the church because Heavenly Father has a time for us to understand EVERYTHING but right now is not the time brother and I can say to you that If Heavenly Father will command us to practice polygamy again it will be hard but if he commands me to do that I will do it just for the Lord.\n11:51 AM\n \nS: I think it is easier for you to say that because you are not married.\n11:52 AM\n \nY: May be he lie because back then as well the Government did not allow polygamy so we has scare that everyone knew \n11:52 AM\n \nS: If you were in a monogomous relationship with a wife and knew just how bad that would hurt her then I suspect you would nor be so ready to have lot's of women..\n11:52 AM\n \nJ: well we invite to ask Heavenly Father about that, we can promise you that you will receive answer for yourself. just like you said earlier you serve your mission and you're raise in Church, and i just wondering why you still have doubts in your hearts? that's means you lack of faith in God? \n11:53 AM\n \nS: yes, I know it was illegal.\n11:53 AM\n \nY: I will be marry after my mission brother and I can just have so many mothers so I do understand if the Lords commands me to do it I will do it just for him not for me \n11:53 AM\n\nS: Yes it was illegal so may be that was one reason he had to lie \n   That makes some sense for him to hide the practice from others outside the church, but I'm talking about him directly lying to Emma and other member that were close to him.\n   I have prayed more than you know to make sense of this.\n11:53 AM\n \nY: We never know if the Lord told Joseph Smith to hide it from them as well brother \n11:54 AM\n \nJ: Stan do you believe that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God?\n11:54 AM\n \nS: The only feelings I get are that it was wrong. You invite me to seek the guidance of the HG, and I do that.\nI'm not sure what to think anymore.\nIt seems like a prophet has to meet some standard.\nI know they are not perfect, but....\n11:54 AM\n \nY: Brother do you have a strong testimony about the church?\n11:55 AM\n \nS: Well, I've lived as a faithful Mormon for 44 years...\n   Do you think that someone can be a prophet and also a liar at the same time?\n11:55 AM\n \nJ: so you say that the prophet is aliar?\n11:55 AM\n \nS: The Church essays and documents say that he was a liar.\n11:56 AM\n \nY: And have you seen blessings from being member of the church all this time?\n11:56 AM\n \nS: I hate the idea, but the documents are very clear. He lied constantly to those closest to him about his involvement with all those other women. (close to 40 or something).\n   I have seen blessings, but I have also seen people who are not members of my church be blessed an dlive good honest lives.\n11:56 AM\n \nJ: we have a question, why we look for the weakness of prophet Joseph Smith if we enjoy the blessings that Through him we have gosepl in our life today?\n11:57 AM\n \nS: It doesn't seem like getting blessings is a good way to know if this is the right church.\n11:57 AM\n\nS: Um like I said, it seems liek you can live a good life and be blessed without him.\n   You don't believe that only mormons can be happy or good right?  \n\nY: Brother is so sad that you are doubting about the Gospel of Jesus Christ, But we can not strength your testimony or your faith the only one that can do that is you brother  \n11:58 AM\n \nJ: so are you saying that Joseph is not a prophet of God?\n11:58 AM\n \nY: You were a missionary and you change so many peoples life \n   You show them the right path to follow \n11:58 AM\n\nS: I'm saying that I'm starting to doubt. You never answered me. Do *you* think that he can be a prophet and also a liar? That's the issue I'm struggling with.\n11:59 AM\n \nJ: The Church that Joseph Smith was the true church that Jesus Christ established before, and we have the fullness of the Gospel. we should be grateful for this blessings that we have?\n12:00 PM\n \nS: Yeah that is true, but what if I was wrong?\n   I am grateful for my blessings, but I'm wondering why Joseph would do these things... It *feels* wrong to me.  12:01 PM\n12:00 PM\n \nY: Brother I have the blessing of been a missionary right now and I can tell you that you were not wrong I can promise you that al, this things are truth and I just not know it nut I feel it brother and I have a strong testimony about this church and I will never leave for anything.\n12:02 PM\n \nS: So many of those girls he married were so young. I've read some of their stories and it ruined many of their lives...Let alone poor Emma.\n12:02 PM\n \nJ: Stan do you ever wonder why God commanded them to practice back then?\n12:03 PM\n \nS: So there is no amount of evidence that would cause you to doubt?\n   I'm starting to think that he didn't command them to practice it. That's the root of my problem.  \n12:03 PM\n\nJ: well stan if you remember in the bible? God commanded the prophet to practice polygamy, just like Abraham, Moses and Noah. so why do you think they practice that? \n12:05 PM\n \nY: Of course something I do doubt but I know that we are in the right Gospel and there is no other Gospel that will help us go back to the presence of our Heavenly Father that is why we know about this amazing plan that He has for each one of us. I will never leave this church brother I can promise you that.\n12:05 PM\n \nS: The bible talks about those people practicing polygamy. No where does it say that it was commanded of God.\n12:06 PM\n \nJ: do you want to know the reason why they practice polygamy?\n12:06 PM\n \nS: even the book of Mormon in Jacob says that polygamy is an abomination.\n12:06 PM\n \nJ: That's so true, but if God commanded to His Disciples so do you think you need to question about it?\n   you know why the reason they practice polygamy?\n12:07 PM\n \nS: the issue here is based on the details of what JS did in regards to polygamy, I have a *very* hard time believing it was commanded by God.\n   That's the issue.\n   By their fruits ye shall know them.\n12:08 PM\n \nJ: well Stan, our shift is done, we hope that you will find answer to your question and we're so happy talking to you. we hope that you have a great day. \n12:09 PM\n \nS: The fruits of polygamy were lies, deceit, broken lives,\n12:09 PM\n\nS: This feels liek you are just trying to get rid of me.\n   I understand. I've gotten that every time I've asked questions at my ward like I said.\n12:10 PM\n \nY: We are going to transfer you to other sisters brother so that you can continue talking to then do not feel like that please \n12:10 PM\n \nJ: well if you want we will transfer to the other missionaries so that, you can ask too.\n12:10 PM\n \nS: You hope I will have a great day? I'm in agony wondering if I've devoted the last 44 years of my life to a fraud...\n12:10 PM\n \nY: I know that we talk to you more than members of your ward brother so do not said that please \n12:11 PM\n \nS: yes, I do appreciate you talking with me, it's just that I didn't get any answers...\n   Maybe there just are no answers to be had...\n   I'm sorry. Perhaps it was silly of me to think that you would have some magical answer. I've spent hundreds of hours thinking about these issues.\n12:11 PM\n \nY: We will transfer you may be other sisters can help you better than we did help \n12:12 PM\n \nS: I've spent so many trips to the temple, and it all just still feels so wrong.\n   I think maybe I need to just give up.\n   Maybe he just wasn't a prophet after all. It kills me, but I just can't see how God could want those things.\n12:12 PM\n \nNow chatting with Avery &amp; Youngbee\nA   \nHi Stan, \n12:13 PM\n \nS: I'm sorry, I don't know if I can go on like this. It's too hard to talk about the details... I think the other guys just decided I was a lost cause anyway.\n12:14 PM\n\nS: I can't bear to talk through all this again right now.\nGod bless you all.\n12:16 PM\n \nA: That is okay,\n\nS: All my life I thought that the more you looked into the details of the Church, it's founding prophets, and history, the more you would just know it was true.\n   It kills me to find that the more I look the worse I feel about it.\n   How can that be right? How can God expect me to believe when the more you look, the more you find showing that it was wrong....\n   Even when I listen to conference I'm told to just ignore the ugly details. I want it to be true, but....\n   Seems like when I grew up in the church, the message was \"You can know for yourself, just pray and ask\" Now I hear in conference instead things like \"Doubt your doubts\", and \"You can choose to believe anyway\". It's like even the Church knows that it only works if you don't look too deeply.\n12:21 PM\n\nA: Yes this is a topic that is hard for a lot of people, Even me.\n12:23 PM\n\nA: I believe that there are things in this life that we are not meant to understand. \n12:25 PM\n \nS: That brings no comfort.\n12:26 PM\n \nA: I have my own questions that were hard to me but with time and prayer I became at peace. I still dont understand at all my questions but I know that God is true and there. Think of your 44 year in the church, your mission, and All the time and God has answers your prays. \n12:27 PM\nJosephs Smith was not a perfect guy being a Prophet does mean that you are perfect. So yea He may have done somethings that he didnt like or things we dont understand why, but look at what God was able to do by using him. We have the Book of Mormon, we have a better idea and relationship with God and Jesus Christ.\nEverything that matter the most to us are because of God. \n12:29 PM\n \nS: It seems to me that I can have the same relationship with God with or without Joseph.\n   I don't need Joseph to be perfect, but it seem like he should at least be good. Certainly I was taught all my life that things like lies and infidelity were things that would prevent me from having the spirit with me.\n   But now it seems like the church is telling me to just accept that Joseph had the spirit even when he was doings bad things.\n12:37 PM\n\nA: You may or may not need Joseph for he was just a man that God use. But you Do Need what God use Joseph to bring back.\n12:39 PM\nA: think about all the good No Great amazing things we have today because Joseph Smith was a prophet \n12:40 PM\n \nS: It seems like I can find all that is good in the church in other churches.\n   Certainly you don't think that all non-mormons are going to hell?\n12:41 PM\n \nA: So living with your Family again forever that doesn't seem that great?\n12:41 PM\n \nS: Certainly you don't believe that non-mormons can't be happy. or good.\n12:42 PM\n\nA: THe book of Mormon has not help you at all in your life? \n   so many more we could go over\n12:42 PM\n \nS: Many Churches teach that families will be together in heaven. that is not unique to LDS fiaht.\n   The good principles found in the BoM are also in the Bible.\n12:42 PM\n\nA: Can we call you? \n12:43 PM\n\nS: I've lived it all my life, but I've seen others outside the church that are just as happy.\n   I'm at work. Maybe I can call you?\n   I have a lunch break coming up.\n12:43 PM\n \nA: Well yea God still love people who are not LDS. He is not going to with hold some happy days just cause they have not found out about the church yet. \n   I really want to be able to help you with this.\n12:44 PM\n \nS: So if God's love and blessings are unconditional, then why do I need to believe that Joseph was really doing something God commanded him to? There are horrible things that happened with regards to polygamy. I'm much happier thinking that JS just did that stuff himself, and not that God actually wanted that.\n12:45 PM\n\nA: Why?\n12:46 PM\n\nS: Um because I want to believe that God is good and wouldn't command the kind of behavior we are talking about.\n   Which sounds better to you? That Joseph made some mistakes (like really big ones), or that God really wanted all the lies, and destroyed lives that were the fruits of polygamy?\n\n\nA: I will answer you just think of this frist. So lets just say that yes that was just Joseph not God....so  what would that take way form the Book of Mormon or temples? \n12:48 PM\n \nS: Well, most of the world including tons of literary scholars believe that Joseph simply wrote the BoM. If he lied about all the details of polygamy, then it makes me doubt his character and wonder if he did just write the book himself.\n12:50 PM\n \nA: Okay if you are going with the histroy then what about him having to little schooling. How could someone with his background write a book that 1) talk to everyone in a different way. It makes us all believe that there is  a God. \n12:51 PM\n \nS: If polygamy was just Joseph (which seems more and more likely to me), then I have to wonder not just about him lying about other things, but also about the entire idea of learning truth through the spirit.\n12:52 PM\n \nA: okay side note do you believe in God? Do you want to have a relationship with Heavenly Father? \n12:53 PM\n\nS: The issue of Joseph producing is well studied. As I said, world scholars don't consider it that amazing of a feat. He was more learned than you imply. He was obviously an accomplished orator. He dictated it to a scribe.\n12:54 PM\n\nS: Yes.  I've read the BoM countless times. I read a few books a week. As far as books go, the BoM is not a remarkable liteary piece.\n   I'm wondering what you answer was...\n   Are you happier thinking that the ugliness of polygamy was Josephs doing, or God's?\n\nA: There are a lot of things that I dont understand because I have not have time to really look in to all that the history is and other things of the church. Even though I dont fully understand everything I know that God has His our way of doing things. Yes I fully believe that God told Joseph Smith to do that. brother Stan dont take this rude but you seem to already have an answer in your mind and nothing that I can say will change your mind. To me is seems like to do want to know why this happen but are not willing to have faith. \n1:00 PM\n \nS: I'm willing to have faith, but faith isn't something that is supposed to be used to ignore evidence.\n   Faith is belief in things we hope are true, but don't know.\n1:01 PM\n \nA: There is a great wed site that talk more about Joseph. It is a wed site fo  all those hard question we have. IF you want and are willing to looking in to it with real intent I would love to give that to you\n1:01 PM\n \nS: I had faith all my life that everything in the church was what I had been taught. Now I dig deeper using the Church's own materials and I see that I was frequently lied to.\n   I'd would love to know what website you are referring to.\n   I've read everything on the Fairmormon site,\n   I've read most of what the old maxwell institute has.\n   I've obviously read all the church essays. Rough stone rolling, etc.\n   I've just recently re-read Teachings of the Prophet Josephs Smith\n1:02 PM\n \nA: What do you want to find? \n1:03 PM\n \nS: Answers!\n1:04 PM\n \nA: to what?\n1:04 PM\n \nS: What website do you have that provides answers to questions like why would Joseph lie to those closest to him?\nI've already spent hundreds of hours searching for truth and answers.\nI'll look at whatever you have if I haven't already..\n1:04 PM\n \nA: I think you need to reword your question. Because you will not find the real answer for why he lied. instead look for why did God think that this was something they had to do. \n1:06 PM\n \nS: Why would God want to destroy the lives of those young girls that he supposedly commanded Joseph to marry? I've read the entries from their journals and it is sickening. I feel so bad for those young women. I have kids that are those ages. It makes me feel sick inside to realize that I wouldn't trust Joseph to be left alone with my own daughters...\n1:07 PM\n\nS: That's the thing, I don't think that any God that is good would want those things. Sneaking around behind Emma's back to have sex with other women. That is not the kind of God I believe in.\n1:08 PM\n\nS: What website were you referring to? If there are answers I want to find them.\n\nA: Yea same here. I want to give you another view of looking at your question. You said you have spent hours looking it up and pray well maybe you are just not asking the right question. Like real intent mean to be open to all answers.\n1:09 PM\n \nS: How dare you doubt my intent. I've spent the last 2 years serving weekly in the temple and spent literally hundreds of hours pouring out my soul.\n   I've been faithful my whole life.\n1:10 PM\n \nA:  Sorry I didnt mean to doubt you.\n1:11 PM\n \nS: I've done all that was asked of me.\n1:11 PM\n\nA: sorry that it came off that way\n   What had been asked of you? \n1:11 PM\n \nS: I've served faithfully in the Church. I've given my all to the Lord.\n1:12 PM\n\nA: What do you think God is trying to teach you? \n1:12 PM\n \nS: Maybe that I need to move on and that Joseph wasn't his prophet after all.\n1:12 PM\n\n\nA: You know what I think. The sister have told you and try to give you ways. I am sorry that you haven't find your answer but I know that the Book of Mormon is true. It is was written by prophets in olden times. I know that God uses that Book as a way to talk to His children. That the Book of Mormon explain the Bible and together we are the closest to God that we can be.\n1:15 PM\n \nS: Were you being honest when you said there was a web resource with answers to difficult questions about JS?\n1:17 PM\n \nA:  Yea that was fair Mormon.\n1:17 PM\n \nS: ah, ok.\n1:17 PM\n \nA: You know that even in the Book of Mormon there are people who did not get their answer right away .they have to wait.\n1:17 PM\n \nS: To be honest, I'm not sure I'd recommend that site to other people who are searching.\n   If anything, all it did was introduce me to a whole bunch of other issues with the church and its history.\n   They didn't have any answers that made sense regarding Joseph and his involvement with the nastyness of polygamy.\n   Saying \"wait until you are dead\" as an answer to important questions just doesn't work for me.  Thank you for trying to help, but....\n1:17 PM\n \nA: I know that the answer will come as you read the Book of Mormon. It may not say word for word about Josephs Smith but I know that you will feel the spirit as you really study it and look for God in it's pages \n1:21 PM\n \nS: I've done that for far longer than you have been alive.\n   no offense. I know you are trying to help.\n1:21 PM\n \nA: Yea, Keep going! this is life is not easy and maybe this is just the trip that God has for you. Hold on to what you know is true.\nTrial*\n1:23 PM\n \nS: I hear you, but more and more I'm thinking that what he is telling me is that Joseph wasn't a prophet.\n\nA: Well.... I guess you have your answer. Please just go back. back to the time when you first prayed about the Book of Mormon remember what that was like. God telling you that it was true.\n   Just want to remind you of that.  \n1:30 PM\n\nS: When I pray, I feel more peace about the idea that he jsut wasn't a prophet than the idea that God actually wanted all that stuff.\n   I've reached a point in my life where I can see just how emotionally manipulative the church has been to me. I feel liek I also once knew that Santa Clause was true and real. I can't go back to believing that now that I 've seen the evidence against.\n1:31 PM\n\nS: More and more it feels the same with Joseph.\n   I started this chat today thinking/hoping that missionaries might have the answers I was looking for.\n   I think that perhaps the opposite happened. Maybe this was what I needed to finally accept that it wasn't true and begin to let go. My family will be devistated, but I feel like I should \"do what is right and let the consequences follow\".\n1:33 PM\n \nA: Alright, sorry we couldnt help more\n1:34 PM\n \nS: Thank you all for your time. I know your goal is not to help people leave the church, but this seems like the right path.\n1:34 PM","name":"t3_48dzmm","from":null,"locked":false,"media_embed":{},"gilded":0,"created_utc":1456798834,"distinguished":null,"subreddit":"exmormon","media":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"hide_score":false}

I am 19 years old, from Denmark and been having troubles with every trip so far.\n\nSo a few days ago this week I ate around 2g's of cubensis, although this was not a very strong trip the \"come up anxiety\" was terrible. Every time I eat lsd or shrooms I have a nightmare the first 2-3 hours, I do not feel in control at all. While my friends are having a good time, I am fighting to keep my shit together.\n\nAfter ingesting the shrooms I did not expect anything from it, was generally feeling happy. When I started feeling it, I get a little overwhelmed but just try and roll with the flow. Negative thoughts come into my head, and I feel like I have to be on the move because the negative effects is way to intense when I'm sitting still thinking about it. \n\n2 hours after ingestion still trying to keep my shit together, I sit down and watch some tv. the images are fascinating but I can't understand shit of whats going on. Still trying to keep my shit together I get brainzaps, where it feels like my brain and vision is trying to adapt to the psychedelic. This happens on average every minute and it makes it impossible for me to let go of the negative thoughts. Now the negative thoughts is usually based on my question, whether what I am feeling is normal or not. I don't think I am fighting the trip, but fully letting go and just trip out makes me afraid ill go into some psychotic state. \n\nAround 3 hours after ingestion I feel very little to no anxiety, sort of like my body and brain is fully adapted to the psychedelic. But at this stage when I'm at the plateau of the trip I get really bored and want it to be more intense.\n\nI want to up the dosages, because it gets boring after the first few hours.\n\n- My father has Bipolar, so that adds to my worries. \n- Should I give up Psychedelics?\n","name":"t3_48e03v","from":null,"locked":false,"media_embed":{},"created_utc":1456799013,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"ups":5,"author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.Drugs","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/48e03v/is_this_normal_shrooms_come_uppeak/","archived":false,"title":"Is this normal?

The arm is about the same length as my right, which is completely normal, but clearly I can't grip a damn thing with my pincers.\n\nI've gotten around this on other major lifts and workouts with careful balance and terrible form. I can do pullups to about 90% the way down by wrapping the whole hand over and just using my wrist to grip the bar.\n\nNever done deadlifting though, always worried about proper form which I figured would be my downfall. In addition my back was pretty messed up until a couple years ago so I stayed away from heavy things and back. Nowadays the back is pretty much fine, but I'm still scared to try deadlifting. Not worried about embarassingly light weight, but more about whether it's viable for me.
