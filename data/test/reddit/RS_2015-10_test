Right now I have $2k left on a hospital bill I'm trying to pay down, on top of a $4k loan and almost $6k in CC debt. So, about $12k in total debt. This is the first time I've ever had to deal with any form of debt, so I have no idea how to budget or go about this properly.\n\nMy bill breakdown as of right now:\n\n* Rent/Utilities: ~$1400  (I live in Southern California, this is the best I could find)\n* Medication:~$200\n* Dr Appointments:Between $150-$300 (averaging 1-2 a month, after insurance)\n* Car: $280\n* Insurance: $150\n* Food: $300\n* Gas: $150\n* Loan: $200\n* Hosp. Bill: Varies, but usually $50-$200\n* Credit Card Minimum: $170\n\n\nAs it stands my monthly paycheck is about $3650 after taxes-$500 of that is going to be tucked away into a savings account as this health stuff drained my safety net. \n\nI'm worried that once my insurance deductible resets in January, I'm going to be up shit creek (just one of my meds is ~$400 until I hit my $1.5k deductible) and I'll just be adding onto this debt pile.  Even worse, I have to try a new, insanely expensive medication - if it works, there's a chance I'd be on the hook for $4k in January alone, almost doubling the debt I have now!  I need these meds in order to work/function, or I'd never do this.\n\nIs there anything I can do to get this debt under control? Should I not be tucking that money into savings, and use it to pay down the CC?

I know you can't give me a diagnosis, but I was hoping you might be able to let me know if I should pursue a diagnosis or if I'm just a mental health hypochondriac. This will be long, because I don't want to exclude anything that might be important. There are certain hallmark aspects I don't think I have, i.e. routines about certain things, and I fear that I'm simply over exaggerating \"symptoms\" in my head to justify maladaptive behavior. I haven't gone into my symptoms of OCD/Perfectionism/GAD too much in this post, because frankly, I feel like I'm already oversharing a LOT.\n\n I am 27 years old and I have struggled with what I internally called \u201cmy weirdness\u201d all my life. I have always felt out of step with my peers, my siblings, and even my parents. My parents say it\u2019s just because I was smart and mature for my age (I often preferred hanging out with the adults/older siblings). But my whole life I have felt like I have to wear a mask in public in order to be accepted/fit in because I\u2019m just not \u201cnormal.\u201d I talked with too many big words, I was overly sensitive, and I wasn\u2019t easily able to socialize with the \u201ctypical\u201d kids my age.  I remember as a child consciously focusing on making sure I was making the appropriate facial expressions in conversations, and I wonder if I tend to over express with my face now as a form of compensation.   Today, I still monitor any interactions mentally to make sure I\u2019m interacting \u201ccorrectly.\u201d I feel that I should mention that I am in the process of possibly being diagnosed with OCD/GAD, as it may be that my experiences stem more from those issues than being an Aspergirl. But, I thought it was worth investigating, because it would explain so much. \n\nI have a list of behaviors/attributes that make me lean towards Aspergers as opposed to just OCD/GAD because they seem to be more innate and less \"external.\" They are as follows: \n\n* Stimming Behaviors? I have always had some kind of fidgeting tendency; nail biting/skin picking has been the most long lasting. But as a kid I went through a few phases for short spurts where I did other possible \u201cstimming behaviors\u201d i.e. I chewed on my shirt collar, eating my hair (not digesting, more chewing also I guess), and (I\u2019m very disgusted to admit) nose picking. When I get extremely upset, I tend to curl up in a ball and may rock back and forth. I have had some success not biting nails recently, but only by picking up other objects to fidget with. \n\n* Executive Functioning: I want desperately to do things \u201cright\u201d and be \u201cgood,\u201d but I am very forgetful, absent-minded and disorganized/messy. I also find self-discipline/motivation very difficult. I love planning things, but am terrible at implementing my plans in an efficient manner. This of course could also be more OCD/Perfectionism. \n\n* Sensory Issues:  I don\u2019t think my sensory issues are as severe as others, but certain songs/sounds make me physically uncomfortable (straw on domed cup lids, styrofoam rubbing, elevator jazz.) I can\u2019t eat certain foods because of textures (peas, some beans), also sometimes food reminds me of other things (sausages-phallus, grapes-spider abdomen, shrimp-caterpillar). Flourescent/artificial lighting in the daytime is always aggravating. As far as smells, there are a few that come to mind that evoke a very visceral reaction, though this may not be atypical: weed/cigarette smoke, gasoline, permanent markers and vinegar. I am very sensitive to touch (in an enjoyable way),  but am shy/slightly uncomfortable about interpersonal touching between me and people other than my fianc\u00e9, son and parents i.e. hugging, hand-holding, cheek kissing. I also HATE being tickled and ironically am ticklish everywhere. I do hug my friends and siblings, but I have to force myself. I can\u2019t sleep without a blanket or sheet over me. Finally I get overwhelmed/bewildered and extremely anxious in crowded events/events with too much commotion or noise, and also in disorganized stores/stores with too many products. \n\n4.\tI am very clumsy and have been my whole life. I am constantly tripping, bumping into things, knocking things over, dropping things, etc. Sometimes I'm holding something and it seemingly \"slips\" right out of my hands. \n\n* Social Interaction: I don\u2019t know if I can say I have the stereotypical \u201csocial interaction\u201d issues; I can recognize sarcasm and rhetorical questions, and I took the facial recognition quiz without much difficulty. I used to struggle with telling if someone was flirting with me, though I\u2019ve gotten better I think over time. I do tend to believe people/give them the benefit of the doubt, and if someone is joking in a dead-pan way I am not able to pick up on this right away. I think I have a pretty good sense of humor. Thinking back, I can see instances where I\u2019ve adopted mannerism, expressions, and slang from other people. I feel I often have to adjust my speech around certain people because I use too many big words, and have been told I speak in a roundabout way, especially when I\u2019m in confrontation. I  can function more or less normally in social situations, but definitely need time to myself to reboot. I have great difficulty articulating my feelings, and if emotionally overwhelmed, I often struggle to identify feelings even to myself. \n\n* Confrontation: I hate it, I get into a panicked state and either start crying or shut down; I think it\u2019s called emotional stonewalling? I find arguing and even debating passionately (even when I\u2019m not directly involved) to be immensely anxiety inducing. I even have a hard time reading debates on facebook, reddit, etc. When having a discussion/argument, I grow mentally exhausted; I begin to lose track of what\u2019s being said.  After awhile, I often find myself agreeing with the other person so it will end or becoming quieter and quieter until I find it difficult to speak or er express myself at all.  I also find that I get upset when agitated (almost always end up in tears), rather than angry 95% of the time. (This also may be more OCD). \n\n* Obsessions: I am extremely passionate about film &amp; television. I memorize parts of favorite movies (or sometimes entire movies) easily, and can recall plots and cast members from movies I\u2019ve seen years ago without much trouble. I hope to be actively involved in the industry someday. Throughout my life, I have gone through many phases of being extremely enthusiastic about topics for a short period, and then moving on to something else. When I was young I would go to the library often and usually get several books on my interest to read each time (i.e. horses, dogs, ancient Egypt, Native American cultures, etc.) I do this with music (playing certain songs or whole albums repeatedly), films, books, hobbies, etc. I am big into research; whenever I have a question that needs answered or interesting topic I will put hours into reading online, books, etc. \n\n* Talents/Interests:  I find poetry writing comes easily to me; I also enjoy writing short stories (though I tend to start one and never finish it). I love acting and singing, reading (though I find nowadays I lean more towards fiction and \u201csimpler\u201d literature than I used to.) I struggle with math, chemistry and physics. \n\n* Blended Animus/Anima: I have never been interested in makeup and hair styling, and only minimal interest in fashion. I only learned enough so that I seemed like a normal, functioning girl. I loved Batman, X-Men, Starwars, playing video games and other more \u201cboyish\u201d interests and still do, but also enjoyed playing pretend with my dolls/stuffed animals. I will say that I spent a lot of time with my older brother (3-ish years apart) growing up, which may account for the varied interests. This may also be why my handwriting is so boyish (super messy.)\n\n* Misc: I have a hard time focusing on dance numbers; I can only watch one or two dancers are a time. I also have a hard time learning choreography quickly; it takes a LOT of repetition.  I have\n\n* Childhood Behaviors: I used to use a \u201cbaby voice\u201d when I was nervous which my mom scolded me for continuously. I still think I pitch my voice higher when I\u2019m out and about then when I\u2019m at home. I also used to have a hard time making eye contact; I trained myself to after my mom kept reminding me, but I still find it uncomfortable. I had a very advanced vocabulary at a young age and was actually sent to speech therapy because my parents thought I had a speech impediment. The therapist said I was just trying to use words too big for my mouth. I was (and still am to some extent) a very sensitive, emotional child with a large imagination. I preferred playing by myself most of the time. I had a favorite dress when I was about 5 that I wore every day for a long time until my mom discarded it. Finally, I was a voracious reader:  for example, I read Little Women at age 9 and The Lord of the Rings at age 11. \n I know this is insanely long; and I thank anyone who took the time to read through it. I would be extremely grateful for any input you guys may have.

If it breaks rules I'm sorry remove it... My awesome hubby told me to check this page out a few months ago. I didn't realize there were so many people like my mother. My Egrandmother took care of myself and my siblings my whole life... While my Nmom  basically lived with us as the equivalent of an older bratty sibling. Example: My mother after dropping me off with my grandmother when I was about 2 because babies are hard, ran off with my Nfather, got married, bred 2 more times and only came back to drop off children or get money. When my parents divorced I was told by Nmom that it was my fault because I ruined her body... I was 5. My grandmother worked 14 hours a day at a factory, my grandfather had a paving business, my mother decided since her looks were destroyed by my birth, never my brothers, she was going to collage... My grandparents paid. After 6 months of about 12 new \"uncles\" my mothers grades came in... At 25 she flunked out of school because \"my teachers don't understand how hard being a single mother can be!\" Fast forward to my EStepdad I was 7 and knew way more about my mothers social activities than most children know as adults...after a week of meeting up while my grandmother was at work, my mother moved him in claiming undying love. He was the enabler she always wanted, she could lie, cheat, steal as much as she felt like, he would always fix, pay, or argue for her. The night they decided to move away was because my grandmother gave me sandwiches for myself and my siblings, because my caregivers ordered a pizza for themselves and didn't share with children because it was bad for us.(by 10 I'd learned to ask my grandparents for/about dinner, school, clothes, my brothers care, problems I had etc) My mother and stepfather got a house(more on that later), and somehow got custody of us from my grandparents... I'm 11 when I realize my grandma and grandpa have been the muzzle on the beast. I was the scapegoat because I looked and acted the most like my father... There was no quarter, no mercy, and no escape. My first period was a source of embarrassment, not taught anything I had accidents.\"until you learn to be cleanly these will be tacked to your door\"... I learned quickly. Gaslighting galore... I never said that, you are lying, I had it so much worse, if I upset you you should learn to deal, the world is a harsh place, I'm only trying to protect you... I tried to talk to a counselor at school, my mother became a substitute teacher \"so people won't believe your lies\". No dates except for her choice. No makeup to cover bruising, \"it makes you look easy\". No avoiding church, because then I'll wait til you are doing homework and let EIGHT grown men into your room with no supervision to anoint you with oil and exorcize the demon in you... I laid low until I got out at 17, my future MIL and my first hubby had me pack a bag and snuck me out under the premise of helping with a church activity... Found out my grandparents had a savings account for me that only they and my mother could access, they had been putting money in for years to help my mother with bills, school stuff, etc. My grandmother said the last statement said 25,000... My mom left 63.02 in it after I left... Hubby was an N... I hacked my way through that briar patch for 3 years.  My current hubby is the most loving and supporting man I've ever met. He encouraged me to go LC and stop paying my NMom's bills, after my Grandmother passed not long after she lost her house, new mustang, my stepfathers fancy new truck, etc. Tried to guilt me into helping, by selling me things I'd bought... I was finally seeing through the looking glass. I started calling her bluff on everything. As things stand today, happy and healthy marriage, son, and a good 2 dozen farm animals. So I just needed to type this up. I needed to tell people who get it. People who realize how bad it was...

I've switched my routine around.  I'm working out, I'm going out for walks, I quit playing videogames unless it's socially, and I even joined Reddit's NoFap just to see what'll happen.

Thinking of being with a girl like that only pushes me harder\n\nHowever, I keep thinking of that one quote, \"You must first love yourself before you can love another.\" I'm very aware of my weaknesses, but I now accept them and try to work on them to become a better person. I don't want this to be another \"what if\" moment, or a regret. At the same time I feel that my large unemployment gap makes me not worth dating. \n\nShould I continue focusing my efforts on improving myself, getting hired and forget about the girl? Or should I go for her now, despite never having a job at 23?\nI mean if she's still on pof.com by the time I'm working (hopefully very soon) I'll totally go for it, but I feel like the only chance I have on dating anyone right now is if I had a job.

My SO is 30 and has no children. He is a hodgkins cancer survivor. \n\nNeither of us thought we would have (more) kids. I didn't think I could have anymore and he didn't think he could at all. But we both wanted one together if it could happen. We were in a great place and had our lives planned. We were going to move in together, get married and start a family.\nI ended up getting pregnant after trying a while but we suffered a miscarriage which badly traumatized me which has continued through out this pregnancy. \n\nI consider this to be our little miracle baby, since we never thought it would happen. My whole family was thrilled. His parents didn't have much of a reaction at all. Neither did his two sisters.\n\nThat reaction has continued. My family calls the baby by his name, buys things for him, and has baked me goodies and been so supportive and loving. I've been taken care of well by them. I've suffered from HG and gallstones so have been vomitting every single day since the beginning and have felt like I'm close to death, Dozens and dozens of trips to the doctor and a couple to L&amp;D. My family has sympathized. His, not so much. His dad is more annoyed that my SO hasn't been able to golf with him this summer. Which he makes very clearly right in front of me. I'm so sorry I've been suffering and taken your son away from you and sports.\n\n\nSo last night I asked if his family had gotten their tdaps yet as it takes a couple weeks to work (his mom threw a complete shit fit over having to get one) he said they hadn't. His dad already has it. His mom hasn't and his sisters won't be coming to meet the baby at all till Christmas at the earliest so they don't need to get it he said. \nUmm wow this is news to me? First grand child, first nephew, first baby for this family and first for your son who NEARLY DIED and not one of them gives a fuck. I am more hormonal and emotional than ever right now and all my SO kept doing was defending them and making excuses for them which just made me madder. They haven't done anything, haven't been concerned, no emotion or reaction to ultrasounds, no excitement, nothing for the baby, nothing. They've always been nice to me but I'm starting to think they just don't want him with me. \n\nHe left and went home (he still lives with his parents at this point) and spent the rest of the night ignoring my texts.  \n\nI cried and hyperventilated so bad I threw up. \n\nObviously if we ever work out we need counselling at this point. It makes me sad that my pregnancy has just seemed to ruin my relationship and even my life. This baby is so wanted but the past 8 months have been pure hell. \nI'm crying right now typing this. I feel so fucking alone. My mom and daughter have been amazing.. I was brought my favourite drink, and a donut and some new blankets and a sleeper for the baby. I hide my emotions big time so my daughter doesn't have to see me that way. My mom is fed up with my SO and his entire family so she's been better than ever to me.\n\nI'm on my couch alone crying. My SO is at home and enjoyed the baseball game, not talking or caring how I'm doing as always.\n\nI don't like any of them right now. \n\nI hate this. Pregnancy hormones are out of control and I don't know how to handle them. I just wanted a family with the love of my life and now I regret everything. I feel like i did when I was 16. Alone and pregnant. \n\nI suffered from depression before this; and it seemed to get worse in the third trimester. My only support system is my family. I'm glad I have them. \n\nI know I sound stupid and dramatic and pathetic. I just needed to get this out. Thanks for listening.

So today my girlfriend came to pick me up from practice and there was a rose (Pink her favorite color) on the dashboard. I knew exactly who it was from because he had texted me the night before asking how much roses costed. The guy who gave it to her is her \"bestfriend\" and she said that \"it meant nothing\". She also said \" he only needed 11 and there was 1 extra so he just gave it to me\". My girlfriend and I have been dating for 11 months and since the first day I met the kid I had suspicions. Mention he does know that we are dating, he's went to the far with us, saw us making out, me grabbing her A** , and tell each other that we love each other.  I met him at her birthday party, and then later in the night I had been called over to talk to her parents and my parents. They all said \"It's ovbious that boy has a crush on her.\" Yet when I asked her about him, she keeps saying that they are \"best friends\".  The situation today went on while we were in the car on the way home from practice. We had stopped in he parking lot of a store and she said \"Ovbiously there's something bothering you so what is it?\"  I picked up the Rose and held it up. Then I said \" Do you  know how this feels? You got a rose from another guy. The same guy you know I don't trust.\" She again said \"We are just friends\". At that point I got rather aggravated.  But I told her just to drive me home. Well we got about 3/4 of the way home and she pulled into the gas station. She turned the car off and picked up the Rose, got out of the car, and tossed the Rose in the garbage. After that she put some gas in the car. We started on our way home again and got  half a mile from my house. She pulled over into a   Restaurant  parking lot. She said \"okay let's talk\". I then proceeded to tell her how I felt on the subject. I mentioned that I thought it was total Bull**** that she was given a rose from another guy. I made her tell me way a rose symbolizes (Love, Etc.).  Once I had said that she replied with \" Is this something your gonna breakup with me over?\" Then se started crying. I told her \"No\" and then she started the car. I knew she was in no condition to drive. She was basically balling her eyes out and about to try and drive. I took the keys out of the ignition and put them under my seat. After all I didn't want her to be like this while driving a huge SUV.  I felt bad that she was crying so I apologized for getting angry. She stopped crying after I hugged her and gave her a peck on the cheek. So my real question is, was it wrong of me to get angry that another guy gave her a rose? Should I be suspicious? Should I confront him? Should I of apologized? \n\nPs. I'm not one to check her phone. I don't believe in that. I think it's totally rude and an invasion of her privacy. So I would never do that. \n\nPss. She knows that I have a short fuse and absolutely hate when guys do stuff of that manner. \n\nPsss. I have been told by her mother, grandma, and great grandma that she adores me. They tell me that she definitely is in love with me.","author_flair_text":null,"media":null,"edited":false,"created":1443696297,"created_utc":"1443667497","author_flair_css_class":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"relationship_advice","secure_media":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.relationship_advice","id":"3n1xuy","title":"Was it wrong of me?

I dont have any friends really &amp; I've never dated anyone - but I really want to start making friends &amp; also start dating guys! I'm 21, female, &amp; I'd really like to have more relationships! \n\nThere are good things about me:\n\nHobbies &amp; Interests)\n I think I have fun hobbies/interests. I really like video games (LOZelda, KH, twitch plays pokemon, pokemon, DDR, GTA, sly, mario kart, whatever), TV (adventure time, anime like death note fate/zero naruto, spongebob, its always sunny in philadelphia, south park, breaking bad, similar types of shows, jeopardy, whodunits like poirot, watching ufc fights), movies (clue, star wars, million dollar baby, tinker tailor solder spy, the departed, the dark knight, nightmare before christmas, hayao miyazaki, similar movies), music (edm, pop, trance, kpop, jpop, rap, hip hop, classical, lots of music). I like taking martial arts classes like BJJ &amp; TaeKwonDo. I like candles, tea, board games, clothing, youtube, paintball, bowling, ice skating, walking at the park, laser tag, flag football, practicing BJJ, karaoke, suntanning, my dogs. Someday i'd like to travel to holland, switzerland, south korea, japan, and maybe other places in the USA as well. I like exercising, cardio, zumba, laser tag, DDR, man hunt, capture the flag, giving massages, whatever. I love singing &amp; funky dancing &amp; listening to happy pop (tiesto, snsd) music as well! Sometimes I can be pretty peppy/happy (I like dancing/doing spontaneous activities).\n\nPerks) I am a nice person, &amp; I'm also very loyal and loving. I can have sex, I can bear children, I can cook, I can clean, I can drive a car, I can go food shopping. I want to be a massage therapist or a personal trainer. I'm pretty easily impressed (I think people who are good at math &amp; video games are so attractive &amp; amazing). \n\nBut there are also very difficult things about me:\n\nAesthetics) I have moderate acne, my hair is curly, i'm always 5 pounds overweight, big butt, pear shaped, face is just kinda below average aesthetically. However, I dont think moderate acne on people is ugly &amp; on a daily basis, I think nearly all guys I see are good looking. I like clean kempt guys (clean as in showered, short hair, shaved, dont stink) who are anything except obese (just cause I'm not sexually attracted, literally no other reason). \n \nBeliefs) I only trust people who support individual pro-choice legitimate suicide, assisted suicide, &amp; euthanasia for people with Quality of Life complaints like mobility issues or privacy issues &amp; related things (such as the terminally ill, the non-terminally ill, the disabled, the unmedicated mentally ill who are coherent, the medicated mentally ill who are coherent, anyone who is coherent), because if I were in that predicament I would want friends/partner/family that would support me. I also support legalized gay marriage, pro choice when it comes to people being in control of their own body, their own mind, their own health decisions/refusal of health decisions. \nBecause of my strong beliefs, I dont really trust people who dont agree with me on those specific issues mentioned. I dont believe in \"respecting other peoples opinions\" on these particular issues, because these policies affect my life as an individual. The problem is, I have never met anyone that really shares my listed beliefs. I also dont really want to date anyone religious just cause I'm not religious &amp; I dunno I'd feel strange about it. I dont wanna date or befriend anyone physically/mentally abusive either but I guess that's obvious...I'm kinda willing to bend my beliefs, but I also need to stay true to my feelings &amp; beliefs.  \n\nHealth) I dont do any drugs - not even caffeine or drink alcohol - because of health reasons (i'm not against other people doing it, if it does not affect me i dont care). I have irritable bowel syndrome so sometimes finding something I can eat is rough...basically plain chicken &amp; plain lettuce : (. I try to follow a very restrictive strict diet for my IBS (gluten free, dairy free, i cant eat lots of fruits &amp; veggies, I eat very carefully when I leave the house). \n\nDo you think I can ever make friends or date guys? \nShould I give up on making friends/dating or should I try to find someone that matches my difficult needs? \nWhat would you do if you were in my position? \nDo you think I don't have enough substantial/beneficial things to offer to other people? \nI'm not particularly pretty or particularly artistic, not award winning super athletic, not particularly funny, I dont have an extremely 24/7 bubbly happy-go-lucky personality, but I think I'm pretty good company and I like doing fun activities like paintball, bowling, BJJ, board games, video games, lots of activities like that. Also, I want to be a massage therapist or personal trainer, so maybe the skills I garner from my career could be beneficial to or of interest to other people too. I'm afraid i'll never make friends &amp; never get married. I think it would make my life kinda lackluster &amp; I'd probably only live to 40 or 50 (life willing) if I were single &amp; socially isolated.

My cost of living is very low, car paid off, very reasonable living arrangement, cheap hobbies. I have basically zero idea as to finances past that.\n\nI plan to be putting in heavily towards my 401k for retirement (which I assume is a good decision, but could be wrong/missing better options), but mostly I'm fairly concerned about my student loan payments. StudentLoan.gov estimates ~3500 a month for the 10 year repayment plan, and I don't know what plan to go for. That seems like a massive amount. The 25 year repayment plan is lower, but obviously will end up paying more (And I'm unsure if I'm allowed to put extra money towards my loan each month as I'm able, or if I'm stuck to the payment indicated by the plan). The income-based repayment plans (particularly the Pay-As-You-Earn plan, which I think I could qualify for, despite some discussed changes coming up), my monthly payments will be lower, but over the 25 year period, and with the tax on the forgiven amount at the end, I'm not sure if it'd be worth it. The spare amount each month could potentially be reinvested to cover that by the end, I think?\n\nIn short, I don't know what plan to go with, don't know what questions to ask, and advice would be great. Links to other posts or resources would also be appreciated!\n\nEdit: Another question, should I look to consolidate and refinance through a third party? I've heard that you lose potential government repayment benefits this way, but is it worth that?\n\nSecond edit: Funnily enough, just this morning I got an email informing me I was accepted into the Pay-As-You-Earn plan. This will put my payments at roughly 900 a month. This is much lower than the 3500 a month, but I'll be paying for longer, and will have to pay taxes on the forgiven income at the end. Is it worth it to stick with this plan, and invest the difference (including partially into somewhere I can use to pay off the taxes at the end)?","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_css_class":"Debt","saved":false,"author":"TheArmyofNone","from_kind":null,"permalink":"/r/personalfinance/comments/3n1z9r/im_25_and_have_312k_in_debt_advice_needed/","ups":2,"over_18":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3n1z9r/im_25_and_have_312k_in_debt_advice_needed/","score":2,"hide_score":false,"id":"3n1z9r","title":"I'm 25 and have 312k in debt, advice needed.","is_self":true,"secure_media":null,"domain":"self.personalfinance","distinguished":null,"num_comments":20,"downs":0,"quarantine":false,"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_text":"Debt","created_utc":"1443668163","created":1443696963,"edited":1443710919,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"personalfinance","author_flair_css_class":null}

Basically, we were very, keyword, *very* fluid in our beliefs. The reason this was is because of my mother. She had a crazy upbringing of sexual abuse and dissent among her sisters thanks to my crazy Grandmother. My dad grew up in a secular household, with some mild Christian undertones. My dad was with my mom for a few years and got knocked up, so that's how I came into existence. After having my sister in 2001, my mother was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Up until about 2010 or 11', I had no idea. I remember in between the ages of 9-14, I remember church hopping, searching for the truth, I guess. I just believed my mother had some gift (her mental illness) from God. That's what she called it. She could speak in tongues (something I found out later to be phony) and said she \"heard from God\". My mother later got into the  whole Illuminati/NWO trip. A lot of the stuff I saw on youtube and different conspiracy theorists really interested me, so I jumped down the rabbit hole as well. \n\nWhat I was studying made me realize that there were a lot of inconsistencies and errors in Mainstream Christianity, but I still had belief. I doubted sometimes, but I doubted my doubts later. I had this idea that I had to go on a journey to find the truth and what God wanted me to do and believe, and eventually tell others. I was apart of a youth group at an evangelist church in my last two years of high school. I came across it by accident, and this girl there was absolutely beautiful. At the time, I thought she'd be perfect for me, but she was too religious, even for me. I studied a hell of a lot of scripture, looked into the context, history, everything. I was honestly looking for the truth, not some community to pray and cry to. I was apart of the youth group for about a year, but it got to a point where what the leader of the group was talking about was bullshit. He was always talking about \"experiencing God/Jesus\" and being \"filled up with God\", which I've never experienced in my life. I always saw people in church with their hands in the air, eyes closed, full of bliss. I never experienced what others called the Holy Spirit. I didn't want an experience, I wanted knowledge and truth. After leaving, I turned from what my mom was talking about too, because I knew she was confused and had a mental illness she needed to do something about. \n\n\nI began studying and researching further into my faith. I came across *Paulianity: Identifying Christianity's False Apostle*. This book basically ripped apart the New Testament for me, because what most Christians quote and live by is **Paul's Epistles**. The book showed me (as well as other sources) that Paul's messages contradicted what Jesus spoke in the gospels. From that point I began to follow what was spoken in the gospels, revelation and OT. I looked and studied harder into the Gospels, as I had nothing else to study. Jesus spoke about \"Not coming to abolish law, but to fulfill\" and \"Not one jot or tittle be removed from the law until heaven and earth pass away\" which equated to me as following The Mosaic Law. The problem was, this is close to impossible in modern society. A lot of laws didn't apply to modern society or was stuff I didn't do anyway. I came to the conclusion that none of it made sense. Why would God make me go on this wild goose chase to find the truth?\n\nWith my mother's mental health exacerbating, she was a vital key in me questioning my belief entirely. She claimed she had a gift, which never brought anything good to her. Why would God give her something like this? Is this how God's people are supposed to be? And if it's not meant to be, why not heal her? When she was in an episode, I put my hand on her and prayed for God to heal her sickness, but nothing happened. Same thing with my father, who has Macular Degeneration. Nothing. Because in a violent bipolar episode she had months ago, my dad filed a protective order against her. She's called my dad Satan before, which was an incredulous statement on her part. She's also accused my Dad of other things, also incredulous. My mom is out of life my right now, and my household, for once in a long time, has some normalcy. Things start to make more sense than they did months ago. My sister is back in regular school, my dad can actually sleep and have people over to have fun, and I've relieved some of my cognitive dissonance.\n\nAfter studying Agnosticism and Atheism, I am now an Agnostic Atheist. I have had lots of fun breaking down my previous faith for what it is.

About a year ago, while I was getting my hair colored by my stylist I complained about it to her and she said it looked like I had psoriasis. I ended up buying myself some [Neutrogena T-Gel](http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/neutrogena-t-gel-therapeutic-shampoo/ID=prod353411-product) and that worked wonders. Solved all my problems, my only complaint was that I didn't like the smell, but whatever it worked. This past month I ran out and I wanted to see what would happen if I quit using it. Of course, it came back. I'll also add that there is absolutely no hair-loss in the area. \n\nApparently my grandfather also suffers from psoriasis of the scalp. \n\nSeparate from the scalp issues, in July, I developed these scaly patches of skin. [PIC 1](http://imgur.com/WlvbHE9) [PIC 2](http://imgur.com/RRlh8Tr). They don't itch all the time, but they do occasionally. They're also not typically round like a ringworm.\n\nNow, I have pets. 2 dogs, 2 cats. All indoors. I would think that if I have ringworms, then they would too. But they're fine, I've searched their bodies and nothing is on them at all. I also have a husband who has nothing like I have on him either. \n\nToday I had made an appointment at a dermatologist. I assumed I could skip the OTC stuff and try and get a prescription or something that would rid me of my problem. She took one look at me and just bluntly said I have ringworms and perscribed me a pill that I'm supposed to take once a day for a whole month. She didn't test the skin or anything, just looked at it. When asked why wouldn't my pets or husband have it as well, she told me it wasn't contagious. \n\nNow, I'm willing to take the pill for the month. But I'm tempted to go to my regular doctor to have a second opinion, which more than likely I will end up doing next week. I'd also like to try something OTC for psoriasis too, if anyone would like to suggest something to me.

This is a throwaway because it would go into sexual abuse. \nAs a child(male), when i was 4 years old my mom told my uncle to make me take a shower. I thought it was okay until my uncle came into the shower naked as well. My uncle is 20ish years old back then and he made me give him a hand job when i was fucking four.\nI told my mother about this after the shower and she told me \"It's because he loves you\". I was only 4 and i thought that was okay because you know, kids don't know anything back then. \nThen at elementary school i was molested by another student at 4th grade. I got the idea that family molesting me is okay but not other people and i told my teacher. The kid didn't even get punished like until i got molested another 2 times by him.  \nAlso at 4th grade my uncle molested me in my own room while my entire family was at the other side of the wall watching tv while i struggled to scream but couldn't because he cupped my mouth. I realized, my mom isn't going to help me. So i didn't tell anyone until sometime in the future\n\nAt High school my uncle would visit my family every summer and this year, he was sitting at the couch and asked me why i didn't say hi. I said hi like i am disgusted. Then i went to lock myself in my room. Later that night he asked if i wanted to watch terminator genesis. I said no. An hour later my mom asked if i wanted to watch the movie and i said no because i was angry . Then my uncle asked me why can't i said it nicely. He then proceeded to say \"this is why people abandoned you\". I am so angry at what he said. I am abandoned because my mom didnt care for me when you fucking molested me? After my uncle left to go back to his home. I told my mom why didnt she care when he molested me. She said thats how vietnamese people show love. I am so fucking angry that she believes in that. This is the same woman who : Stopped me from playing the recorder because she believed i would summon snakes and kill everyone, this is the same woman who told me to stop reading this novel because she saw the cover and she didn't like its art (judging a book by its cover....her madness definitely reflects her eyes) . My mom is Vietnamese and oh man she is so racist. She hates every black person. She likes to mark valuables with a red cross using a sharpie, because she said this wards of the africans so when they break into our house they would see this and leave the valubles. Why? people who break in our house will not turn the light on so they would not see the 1cmx1cm cross and they will not leave without anything valuble. so on the corner of the tv bezel we have a small red cross for some dumb thing she believed. She asked me why i had pimples when i have been asking her to go to the doctor because i had very painful cystic pimples that made me cry everytime it touches something. She didn't understand why i needed a bank when i had over 3 thousand dollars ( i didnt tell her how much i had or else she would force me to give it to her because she thinks i am incompetent in storing money (thats why i have a bank you dipshit). She got mad that my stepdad said \"this singer has a pretty voice\" and she somehow got that translated into \"this singer is pretty\" and they almost divorced because of that. My stepdad is someone i dislike as well. He is power hungry and violent and talks too loudly and is a control freak. Back to my mom, she got mad when i told cps that my uncle molested me and she is disappointed in me that i didnt talk to her about it. I was so angry . I couldn't understand. She didn't take care of me when i was a child and she thought she could be someone i could talk to. She was the person who thought i was going out with a girl because i put on cologne. I put on cologne because the house smelled horrid because she didnt want to clean it up because \"we are renting this house, its not our house\". This is where we eat and sleep and you are doing this? I don't talk about my personal life with her. She joked around saying i have a girlfriend and on the night i went to my girlfriends apartment she texted me so much times saying i know you are doing something bad. Like what bitch? get away from you with my girlfriend? god it is so frustrating. I want to leave her forever and never comeback. I don't know why i have a mom who is racist, only apologized once in my entire life to me and it was an accident. Her apology slipped. She one time accidently hit me and i said ouch . She didn't say anything and i said arent you going to say sorry and she said i didn't mean it. Well the pain has happened , you can't undo it. God. Did i do anything wrong? Why do i have to live like this? I am 17 years old and in my senior year and waiting 1 year to graduate feels forever.

I love to rock climb, board game, slack lining (newest hobby) and just going on random adventures. \n\nIf you are just looking for some fun feel free to send a PM me as well. \n\n","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"from_kind":null,"author":"AT1990","permalink":"/r/r4rtoronto/comments/3n23u0/25m4f_looking_for_my_elliot_reid/","ups":3,"over_18":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/r4rtoronto/comments/3n23u0/25m4f_looking_for_my_elliot_reid/","score":3,"hide_score":false,"id":"3n23u0","is_self":true,"title":"25[M4F] Looking for my Elliot Reid","secure_media":null,"domain":"self.r4rtoronto","distinguished":null,"num_comments":0,"downs":0,"quarantine":false,"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1443670327","created":1443699127,"edited":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"r4rtoronto","author_flair_css_class":null}

First and for most, I don't want to bore any of you with my life and whats going on in it, but the curiosity of our minds sometimes guides us to do things we sometimes don't intentionally want/need to do. Anyways, I'm in a position in my life right now where I have control of my future, I just don't know what feels right, I've tried all my open doors, witch led to other doors, that I've explored and made my decision based upon. Let me fill you in on who I am so you can get an idea of where I'm going. Now first and foremost, I don't have the mindset that I'm better than any human on this earth, were all equal, I don't want to come off as prideful, or wanting to be felt sorry for. I'm a single male, only child, 19 yo, graduated high school and had practically no friends growing up. Few here and a few there. I don't want it to seem like I didn't have a choice, rather that I chose to be that way. Well I did go through the drama and stress of my parents splitting up for almost a year, which may have influenced my decision to have few friends, but thank God they got back together. Anyways, I went to work with my dad a month after graduating, he worked in the union construction, made a good buck. I thought I would end up in his shoes one day, but after working almost 11 months, I just didn't know what to do, I mean I'm still a kid, and going from kid to adult in less than thirty days is an unfamiliar weight on my shoulders, physically and metaphorically. So I decided to quit construction and thought about college, maybe diesel mechanic or something, I'm excellent with my hands. But when that wasn't right for me. Let's take a step back in time a few years when I was sixteen and still get in school. I tried little jobs like security, ( yep 16 and worked security) I had no problem getting that job, I'm 6' 9\" at about 300 pounds. I'm a big dude, I remember one day I was at subway, and a recruiter for the chargers asked me if I wanted to play. I told him no. Why? Cause its not what I want to do with this body in this lifetime, told him I'd rather work in a garage and make $15 an hour working on cars rather than pass a ball around and make millions. Yes I'll admit Ive consciously and intentionally have thrown opportunities down the drain that were just given to me. It's a bit selfish and stupid. But the is not what I wanted. Anyways back to the security. It was a cheap gig, $9/hour 8hours a week, pay was bi-weekly. It was just some extra cash at the time. Then I went ahead and worked with my neighbor after that, he was a dirt bike mechanic. That job was a dream job, one of those ones where you don't feel like your at work. Only way I can describe it is like, when your a little kid, and you can't sleep because your parents told you, you were going to Disney Land the next day. That was everyday for me. But like all goods things in this world it came to an end. I was unemployed after that for quite some time, worked for my neighbors here and there with yard work, and house chores. Funny thing is all my neighbors hated me, I was THAT kid on the block, like I said I was good with my hands. I put those hands to work in the garage, always, I mean i was always building something every waking hour. Whether it be from a pneumatic cannon made out of an old oxy-aceltyne welding tank that shot 12\" long 1\" wide spike that went through 4x8's to what I like to call SFX flam throwers. I used the same welding tank, filled it up with liquid propane and used a sprinkler solenoid to control it, used the tanks regulators to give me a steady pilot light, that thing lit up the night sky with a good 30+ foot flame. Safe to say the cops showed up. But hey it was just an \"engineering project\" for school. Anyways so I was always in the garage building crazy stuff. Back to the present, I was getting a taste of adult hood at an early age, like medicine, but not that pink bubblegum one we all loved, more like the cough syrup made from nightmares. I was at a stand still for a month or two, not knowing what I wanted in life, just waking up at 3am 5 days a week slaving away in construction, going home and same thing the next day, sure I made a few friends here and there, definitely learned alot, got certified to use heavy equipment which was fun, but it just wasn't right, I'm still young and I want to get on the right path before its too late. So I took a couple weeks off from work to get to know myself better and figure out what I want and what I'm good at, but not sacrifice any of my skills or knowledge to a lesser job. I eventually found a company. To keep it confidential and generic, it was a utility company, the ones you pay monthly to keep on. The position came with a company truck and the need of my skills and then some. It was quite a journey to get here, I had to put in an application to see if I was even applicable for consideration of the position, that took a long while, after that, you have to go to a testing date, out of 11 people I was one of the last 2 remaining. basically if you didn't pass the first test, you had to go home and wait an additional year to take the next, that gave me mixed emotions, not sad but nervous and stressed, I had driven a fair share of hours to go to the place where they held the testing. And to have go home after taking one test didn't sink in straight with me. It felt like the hunger games, everyone for themselves. After the first test he said \"If you hear your name stay, if you don't you failed\" he calls out the first name, which wasn't mine, I got butterfly's, then he calls out another, I was so scared at this point, and he finally called mine. Biggest sigh of  relief. Out of 11 three had passed, it was getting intense at this point, I had finished the test 10 minutes faster than the other 2. I was worried I had messed up, and knew I was going to fail for sure. He then called two names which included mine, I had to ask him if he really said my name to re-assure myself. The next test was physical. Like I said previously I'm a big dude, so this was going to be a piece of cake. The they had a minimal passing requirement, I not only pased that but I exceeded the maximum requirement. I had pulled like 380lbs which was the second highest they've ever seen, yes I was proud. After this testing was over I had to do an interview, long story short I got the position. Now I've gone a long way to get this far, and not very many make a t to where I am. But I don't know if I should try the bull by the horns or not. Again another opportunity at my disposal, granted I earned this one. This job would be taking me so far away from home, everything that I am is here, and it would be an entire new life for me and I don't know that I'm ready to make such a huge commitment. I'm still young \"19\" and this could be a career down a pothole infested road, but the end is freshly paved. Is it right or wrong? I've worked hard to get here, I keep coming to this point where an oppurtunity lays itself in front of me, and i don't take that for granted but it alot for one human mind to process in such a small amount of time. I just need a second opinion, that is all I ask.\n\nI apolagize in advance for any misspells, or incorrect  punctuation.","author_flair_text":null,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"gilded":0,"from":null,"locked":false,"retrieved_on":1450760602,"secure_media_embed":{},"name":"t3_3n23y1","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjdm","media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Advice","author_flair_css_class":null,"created":1443699173,"created_utc":"1443670373","media":null,"edited":1443777951,"quarantine":false,"num_comments":2,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_text":null,"id":"3n23y1","title":"A Fresh Start, I think?","is_self":true,"hide_score":false,"secure_media":null,"domain":"self.Advice","distinguished":null}

I'd like to give you all a little background before I dive head first into this thing. I'm 28 years old, a combat vet who has also owned 2 businesses. I just got out of a 3 year stint in the oilfields of North Dakota, hauling Oil and Water and Sand etc. Just moved back to WA State, and have decided I want to get into home renovation. This is a new industry for me officially. I've done several projects in the past, but I've never worked construction as a job, and I've never been to school for it either. I do have a business degree, and I intend on putting that to use in this industry later on down the road. Right now, my focus is getting up to speed on the necessary skills required to be a solid G.C. (again, down the road). A couple months ago, I got picked up by a smaller General Contractor that caters to investors who are flipping houses. The man in charge has been doing this for 30 years, and is a pretty competent and patient guy. I was very clear in the beginning that I was not a skilled laborer, and wanted to learn everything I could from him in order to be at a level where he could use me as a lead. As a company, we pretty much do it all (short of permitted electrical and plumbing). I've done roofs, siding, fences, kitchen and bathroom remodels, complete interior/exterior painting, sub-floor replacement, fixture installation, etc. The problem I'm facing is that I don't have a fundamental knowledge when it comes to construction. I feel like the lack of formal education in this field is putting me at a disadvantage. I don't feel like I have a solid foundation to build on (no pun intended). Short of going to a trade school to get this education, is there any alternative methods of learning the ropes? Are there programs, Youtube channels, books, DVD's, anything that can help me fill the gaps on the basic stuff that would be relevant to what I do? Any other advice that you guys have to offer is more than appreciated. Thanks in advance.
