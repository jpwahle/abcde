So I'm not expecting this to be a long-term roleplay, but a series of short-term ones since we'd do this whenever you feel like it. In other words, I want to be like a rag doll you resort to when you want to get off, and that's it. Just start off with you coming to my room, forcing me into bed, etc.; there's no need to set a whole scenario for this. I'm feeling rather submissive at the moment but I'm a switch, so we could switch roles if you prefer.\n\nI want to keep this realistic, but I'm basically limitless. Some of my kinks include tgirls and strapons, natural bodies, rough sex, sweat, anal, abuse, dirty talk, feet, creampies, pain, stockings, robes, petplay, piercings, fishnets, watersports and more. The more you meet the better.\n\nThere are a few things that I'd kindly ask: Please, be literate and have good grammar, properly used punctuation and caps are a HUGE bonus. OOC chat is fine and I'll send some pictures if you want to see what I look like better, but I don't send\/want nudes, and real reference pictures will definitely have priority. I roleplay in first person and I use quotation marks for speaking. \n\nI usually get a lot of messages, so please if you want to play this send me a message and get my attention (please do include a reference picture)!\n\nPS: I'm in Europe so there might be big time differences.

I\u2019m not sure if this specific experience belongs here, but I can assure you this was no spirit or ghost. This is a true story about something I experienced as a child.\n\nMy name is Avi. When I was 6 years old I lived in a small town in western Washington state. The city is very close to forest area and the population is mostly backwoods, country type.\n\nIn the year 1998 (I think) I was living in town. A night came where something strange and unique happened. My child-mind couldn\u2019t fully grasp what was happening, but neither could the adults who witnessed this.\n\nMy parents, my grandparents, my uncle (a police officer), and all of our neighbors witnessed a large number of floating\/flying green balls of light. They were around softball size, maybe a little bigger. My mother has reminisced in the night and told me about how they chased my grandmother's dig up the street and would pace the local traffic. A family friend admitted to seeing them in the nearby highway that night. My family has a very religious background so their thoughts were that this was sinister and evil, but my memories are different.\n\nI vividly remember the green balls \"connecting\" in lines of 5 or so and spinning around like a baton and then unlinking to fly freely again. They would hover just above the street, up around the street lights and just everywhere in between. My mother kept ushering my brother and I inside out of fear, but I was not afraid. This may have been because I was young and unconditioned, but the lights didn't seem dangerous to me. There must have been at least 100 of them.\n\nI have theories about them, but I've never been able to find any other encounters, so this is my newest attempt. I've even put up local flyers with my email to try and get anonymous stories. People in that area just don't like to talk about this stuff. \n\nTo the credit of my religious family, they did seem to cause the lights to leave. I remember the last I saw of them was as my grandmother was praying and telling them to leave. They suddenly stopped and all at once they shot up into the sky and disappeared forever. I have wanted to see them again ever since. I'm 27 now and I'm still left wondering what they were. My main theory is extraterrestrial.

I am 24 still living at home with my parents still looking for work. Been on and off jobs for the last year not in a financial position to move out yet. Want to be a full time writer and been doing well to build up a following, been working on my craft and decided to go to uni, starting this year. \nConsidering i pay rent agreed between my father and I, and pay for my own rego, insurance, clothes, things i want or need, the only thing my rent contributes is food, electricity and water. I help around the house, do what needs to be done and apply for jobs still. He believes he can dictate what i can and can't do because i am in his words living under his roof and his word is always law. I believe that no longer applies to modern times. It is my house just as it is my siblings, my mums and his.\nMy dad, he's a boomer, doesn't believe you have to apply online, goes with '\"call them up or walk in to speak with manager or call after the interview and do a follow up.\" Thinks I have to be out of the house, believes that i should no longer be here cause of my age. I am in his eyes a financial burden.\nNow my sister, she's a full time uni student learning to be a dr. She turns 20 this year, doesn't pay rent, rego, insurance, all of that is covered by dad as he agreed to do so and stated he would have done the same if i went into uni straight from highschool. My parents run a business and my sister works the small hrs she is given and hold tight onto that money. Spending it more on her GF than anything. \nAll of this is frustrating as dad doesn't approve with my choice to be a writer. He doesn't approve of the course i had chosen, he's not supportive of anything i do, and throws back in my face that he helped me get jobs and how i should be thanking him and blaming me for cocking it up. I gave them my best, many admired that i got up everyday and go to work despite the bullying that went on and still he deemed as \"she could have done better.\"\nThe argument: I clapped back at my dad, trying to lecture me on how to be an adult, how i should work like him because he chose to buy a business and do shit for it, he hates that i have free time and tries to offload more things onto me when there is no need. I have three younger siblings who do less than me. Says he's the only one with a job yet my mum runs the business from home. Stated my sister doesn't pay rent i and i do, as well with rego and insurance and she doesnt pay a cent. Telling me i should get a job, yet i have been applying for months, tell me to move out and so i throw back why i should, putting my foot down telling him he does not dictate my life or my sisters lives and that i do what needs to be done in the house, pay for rent and help when its needed, therefore he shouldn't have a say about anything i do.\nIn the end he says I'm going to get a rude shock and found out later he plans to make me pay for a sixth of everything. I'm not going to let it happen.\nI am sorry for the long post but i wanted to tell someone.

I've played WoW many times before and hadn't played for years until classic came out.

I'm hoping this isn't a bs sub, I really need some advice here. \n\nI'm at a point in my life where I just feel *stuck*. I just turned 22 last week and still live at home. (With my mom and little brother. She doesn't really care that I'm still home - we lived with my grandparents until she turned 30-ish and got an apartment of our own, not that I plan to stay in the house that long.) I pay her $400\/month as \"rent\" and to help out with groceries, cover my phone bill (she's always got money in her account so it's safer for me to have her card on file for my phone), and help pay for animal food. (6 out of the 8 animals in the house are mine technically - I have 3 geckos (I pay all the food for them though), 2 cats, and 1 dog.) \n\nI work a pretty decent job with great benefits - health\/dental\/vision insurance, certain discounts to some places, decent pay, and since I work nights I get a differential on top of my regular pay. I have no opportunity for advancement where I'm at. I work admitting in my local ER (so I register people coming in to be seen, verify insurance, admit people into our med\/surg and ICU units, and occasionally register clinicals that come through). A few months ago I applied for a day time scheduling position in the same unit (but different part of the hospital) and was ultimately turned down (after being told I basically had the job and was given access to the scheduling desktop to get familiar with it). I suspected this was because I'm one of the \"strong\" workers in the ER and my boss didn't want to get rid of me - not many people are willing to work nights either. There really isn't any other place I can go where I'm getting the same pay + insurance without any kind of degree or certifications. \n\nI'd love to have a day job. I feel like I have no life whatsoever outside of work. I come home after my shifts and sleep and by the time I get up it's already later in the day when most people are winding down or businesses are closed, so I can get things done that I need to. I don't do the bar scene. I don't have friends here outside of my coworkers. I have my cousin that lives here (we're very close) but he's in college and has a pretty packed schedule with the amount of homework he has. I hate feeling so cooped up and it's making me depressed because I don't have anyone to hang out with or anything to do (small town, not a whole lot to do that isn't going to the movies that close at 12 or go to a bar from Friday-Sunday). \n\nThat being said, I don't make enough money to move out of the house. I live in a small town (&lt;20,000 people) and a plant made it's way to my county a few years ago, making the rent for apartments relatively expensive for one person. Again, I don't have friends here that aren't my coworkers and all but a couple are either married or living with a s\/o or a roommate. \n\nI know what I want to do in life. My go-to has always been to enlist in the Navy, and I hate that I didn't take my desire seriously while I was still in high school (I've been out of HS almost 4 years) because I've always been a weighty person. I'm also trans (although pre-everything) so it's still kinda up in the clouds whether or not enlisting is possible for me. If I can lose the weight it's possible I can try to enlist, but I have chronic back pain due to a pinched nerve that could DQ me. Losing the weight may or may not ease the pain (normally I don't have issues but here lately it has been flaring up, I'm assuming it's because the weather has been a bit on the cooler side). \n\nI need to lose approximately 100lbs before I can even consider speaking to a recruiter. In the event that the Navy doesn't work out, I'd like to be a pilot for an air ambulance company (think like Life Flight - I'm not sure if that is a nationwide company of if it's \"local\" but you get the point). The problem with this is that most companies require you to be about 200lbs for this - I'm 265ish. You also have to have at minimum 2,500-3,000 flight hours to even be considered for the job. I've also heard that the job area is a little hard to get into unless you're ex-military. \n\nIt's normally not required that you have a bachelors degree with this kind of job, but is preferred, so I've considered a degree in either Aerospace engineering or Aviation science. Both will, in theory, get me where I'm wanting to go. But I'm worried that I've been out of school too long to apply for a scholarship (especially one that requires an essay) and I certainly don't have money for school. I *might* qualify under the Texas Hazlewood Act that could help towards tuition but I haven't looked too far into it. I suck at all things math and physics so I'm questioning how doable an engineering degree would be for me. \n\nTo end the degree talk, I could probably move to part time in my job and do a few online classes (I already have a few done) but I'm not sure how doable moving away from  home would be - my mom had a pacemaker put in last year and I'm not too sure I'm comfortable leaving her yet, and I don't think it would be fair for me to leave my 6 animals here with her without being able to pay to help, and rehoming them isn't an option. \n\nWhat do I do at this point? How do I go about being a functioning member of society where I literally have no way to contribute and can't even go off to do? Maybe there are just too many if's and but's in here and it sounds like I'm just complaining... I don't know. \n\n*If you made it this far... thank you.*\n\n**TLDR:** I'm 22 and still live at home. I work in a place where there is no opportunity for any kind of advancement and don't have the qualifications to move to another job with the same pay and benefits. I don't have enough money to move out and don't have anyone I can roommate up with.

While this is my original Reddit account, I'll use fake names for the story. Me: me, Afton: my wife, Ian: my twin brother,  Rebecca: my brother's girlfriend. My hope is to use this post to help me confront my brother about this problem and hopefully put an end to it. My wife(Afton) has diagnosed anxiety, takes medication for it, and also struggles with depression. My wife uses Pinterest religiously to organize different parts of her life and she's almost to the point of deleting all forms of social media over this.\n\nBackstory:\n\nI started dating Afton right after highschool. Afton and my brother Ian were always on amicable terms, and the three of us even took a few road trips\/vacations together. When Afton started college, I had an internship so my brother would often have lunch with Afton and they would carpool, exchange memes, etc. They were friends. This is important because Afton and my brother are no longer on speaking terms and Rebecca is in no way helping with this. When my brother started dating Rebecca, Afton practically stopped existing in his eyes. He no longer went to lunch with her, stopped responding to her meme text messages, just basically stopped being her friend. It was pretty obvious that he needed Afton as a friend, but when he found a real girlfriend, he had no reason to continue talking to Afton. This affected Afton in a big way because she has a history of friends using her for emotional support, rides, etc., but the moment someone better came along they just ghosted her. Afton is not one to forgive and forget, so Ian's behavior coupled with Rebecca's has left a stain on Ian and Afton's relationship ever since. \n\nOur relationship with Rebecca has always been bad. Before my brother even started dating her, she got a job at the same place he was working at and I made a few comments about her after seeing her around a few times. They weren't horrible, but they weren't nice. This becomes important later.  When my brother announced that they were dating, the four of us decided to meet and have dinner to get to know her. I'll spare the boring details, but the dinner was sub-par. After the dinner, my brother explicitly asked for my HONEST thoughts about Rebecca, and I told them to him. He didn't like them, but he already kind of knew what I thought of her from the past comments I had made before I knew that he was interested in her. One of the comments included that she didn't seem to have many interests of her own, and that she seemed to just copy whatever anyone else liked around her. This is one of the things that both Afton and I picked up on, especially because Afton's mom is the same way. She acts differently depending on who she's around and it's made Afton dislike anyone who behaves in that manner. Shortly after, I learned that my brother told Rebecca everything that we had told him about her, including what I'd said about her before I knew they were dating and everything I had said when he asked me to be honest about what I thought about her. I was very upset, and while I didn't even really NOT like Rebecca at the time, he succeeded in making her think that we both hated her. He also succeeded in making me feel like I couldn't confide anything to him without him betraying my trust to someone he had known for less than a semester of college. \n\nThe Problem:\n\nIan and I have graduated college, I've gotten married to Afton, and we moved to a larger town that is close to where we attended college. During this time, Afton and Ian's relationship has went to shit, my relationship with Ian has been strained, and multiple arguments between me and my wife have ensued because of Rebecca's behavior, documented the best that I can below.\n\nWhen Rebecca first started following the same things on facebook as Afton, we both didn't really think much of it. We didn't know why she was doing it, since we didn't even talk to each other, but it was fine. That's what social media is all about. Afton started noticing that Rebecca had a Pinterest, and that she had similar boards on her account as Afton had. Still, Afton didn't really pay much attention to it. At some point, Afton noticed that every time she would post something on Facebook\/Instagram or pin\/create a new board on Pinterest, Rebecca would save it to her own Pinterest, create a new board, etc. This started bothering Afton so she succinctly blocked Rebecca on facebook. At this time, I thought Afton was being severe, but thinking on it now, Rebecca wasn't  friends with Afton on facebook for very long, if ever, so every time Rebecca got something from Afton's facebook posts, it would be because she specifically searched for Afton's profile and looked through it. \n\nIt was at this time that relationships started getting more strained. Rebecca wanted to come over to our house(Afton and I weren't married yet), but Afton was to the point that she was afraid that seeing our apartment would usher in a new wave of copycat pins on Pinterest for Rebecca's own apartment someday. This, in turn, made my brother mad at me for forcing him to only come over by himself, and I also got mad at Afton because I thought her behavior was a little over the top. Afton notifies me soon after that she's going to block my brother on facebook as well because the copying hasn't stopped and she thinks that Rebecca is using Ian's account to stalk her social media. Another argument between Afton and I ensues because I think she's blowing it out of proportion, and another argument ensues between Ian and I because he's mad that Afton blocked him on facebook. Afton also sent Rebecca a private message telling her to cut this behavior out, but probably in not that nice of terms. \n\nNot long after that round of blocking does Afton realize that Pinterest doesn't actually do anything when you block people besides notify them that they've been 'blocked'. You can still see all of their posts and boards. So Afton has to go through all of her boards and make them private. For some reason this wrecks the organization of her boards and she's really mad because apparently you can be pretty granular with how you save things on Pinterest. Not relevant besides the fact that it causes more stress in Afton's life. Afton's sisters also let her know that Rebecca has sent them both friend requests on their social media accounts, even though they've never seen Rebecca in person before. Afton explains the situation to her sisters and asks them to either block Rebecca or make their accounts more private to people who aren't friended. At this point I asked my brother if he knew anything about this \"nonsense\" as I put it, and he said that Rebecca told him that she accidentally friended Afton's sisters. I told him that was a bit far fetched but I felt like Afton was being a bit severe at the time so I was still opting to take Ian's word for it. \n\nThings don't get much better. Afton tries a few more times to inform Rebecca that all she wanted was for Rebecca to leave her alone. It doesn't stick, and Rebecca denies doing anything that Afton says she's doing. Afton is getting increasingly anxious every time she wants to share a picture of a trip or event on facebook because she knows that Rebecca is going to try and emulate some part of it. More arguments ensue because this is all driving a rift further and further between my relationship with my brother. Ian starts talking to me about the future and Afton's toxic behavior of driving Rebecca out of her life. He tells me when I have kids, how is he going to visit them? Will Rebecca have to stay home when he does? Will my kids ever get to stay at his house? I think these are all great points and I argue more with my wife about how important it is that Rebecca copies what Afton does. I say that it isn't worth any of this shit, but Afton can't stand it. I try to tell her that \"imitation is the sincerest form of flattery\" but it doesn't change anything. \n\nI'm constantly trying to smooth things over between Ian and Afton, and it only turns out poorly. I tell a few small lies about how Afton feels to Ian, how Ian feels to Afton, and then they always end up more mad, as well as mad at me, when they find out that I was trying to smooth things over and neither of them wanted to back down about their issues. Ian keeps bugging me about wanting to have game nights, and how they can never happen with all of this nonsense happening, how this isn't a way to live the rest of our lives. I agree, and I finally get Afton to cave and go to some game nights at my brother's apartment. For the most part, I think things go well and I'm just happy that we can finally maybe learn to co-exist and get past all this. Rebecca is taking interest in Afton and her life, trying to make small talk, and I'm looking at Afton like, what's the problem here? Afton doesn't have a great time but she knows how much I want everyone to get along so she relents. \n\nI thought things were going better until I find Afton crying one night. She's saying she can't take it, why can't Rebecca just leave her alone, etc. I'm wondering what the problem is, and it's a bunch of pins on pinterest of clothes that are the exact same as the ones that Afton was wearing to the game nights, down to the brand and all. I agree that there will be no more game nights, and I tell her that I'm sorry for ever fighting her about this because I'm finally seeing how crazy this all seems. Afton has tried to tell Rebecca how horribly anxious it makes her feel, just to live her own life, etc., and now I'm hating myself for not seeing it sooner. \n\nRebecca doesn't stop. Afton comes to me after work one day and asks me if I told Rebecca where Afton got all of her glasses. I told her of course I didn't, but Afton shows me a picture of Rebecca wearing the exact same pair of glasses that Afton had. I suddenly remember that a month earlier my brother had offhandedly asked me where Afton got her glasses at. Rebecca was wanting new glasses and she supposedly didn't want to spend too much on them. I told him where Afton shopped and forgot about the conversation. I realized that Rebecca just wanted Afton's glasses, and Afton has never worn those glasses again. She had them for like 3 months before that happened. When I married Afton, my brother was in the wedding but Rebecca was specifically not invited. All Afton wanted was for Rebecca to lead her own life and stop copying her so much. That's all she wants. Every time I try to bring up the topic with my brother, he denies that it happens, and even said \"there was a problem, but we've handled it\". After the wedding, Rebecca made pins about our wedding venue, pinned the clothing and dresses that Afton wore on our honeymoon, and made a new board with date ideas similar to posts we had made during our honeymoon. We went somewhere cold because we wanted to experience winter for a change. One of the things we did was go ice skating. I made a post about it and shared a video. Shortly after we return from our honeymoon, Afton informs me that Ian and Rebecca have found a new hobby in ice skating. \n\nIn isolation, each of these things sound like a coincidence. Even now, I sometimes feel like a crazy person because I can't think of a single reason that someone would want to stalk someone else's life so much, and copy so much of their interests. Ever since my brother asked me about where to get glasses, I've hardly felt comfortable having a conversation with him. I'm constantly terrified that I'm going to let something slip, and then suddenly Afton and I's latest hobby together becomes Ian and Rebecca's newest hobby together. For example, Afton recently found a band that she really likes. She can't follow them on social media. She can't pin their tour schedule on Pinterest. She has to pretend that the band doesn't exist, because if she isn't careful, Rebecca will coincidentally discover the same band shortly after and decide they're great. I happen to like the music myself, and it's exhausting filtering my conversations with my brother to make sure I leave it out. We're twins, we share a lot of the same traits and interests, and I talk to him about a lot of things. I now have to filter every conversation so Rebecca doesn't hear something new about Afton. \n\nVery recently I've decided that I can't stand it, and this situation needs to stop one way or another. It's crazy and I can't stand it. Afton had mentioned that she had been saving every instance that Rebecca had copied her for like the past year and a half on her phone, so I asked her to send it to me. That turned into a major problem, because Afton had recently upgraded phones(another thing we've seen pins of) and somehow her screenshots failed to back up to the cloud. Over a year of evidence is now gone. A lot of the stuff in the past Rebecca has deleted, because every time Afton would try and confront her, a lot of the pins would disappear. Afton still got any evidence she could, and she has about 40 instances from the last few months that she could find. This is tearing Afton apart mentally. She just wants to be left alone and she's in constant fear that something stupid that she didn't even care to consider get's found out and copied by Rebecca. \n\nExamples of what Afton has saved go as follows: A selfie that Afton posted during a trip or a date, and then the subsequent pin that Rebecca made of the exact same dress or article of clothing that Afton was wearing in the picture. Another example is that Rebecca has saved pictures of the same car that Afton drives. Like, at what point is it too much? I tried to talk to Rebecca about it, and she acted like nothing was happening at all. Like we were making it up. I told her, it's totally normal for a person to idolize a famous person. To want to copy them, have their fashion, have the things that they have. But somebody you know? Somebody that you would be seeing on a regular basis? That not anything except awkward at best. They also own two cats, just like us, and both of them were acquired after we had two cats. Plenty of people own two cats. They have every right to. It just feels like Rebecca is one step closer to, I don't know, having the exact same life as us? I just don't get it. Ian and Rebecca will soon be moving into the same town that we live in. Ian is surely going to start bothering me even more about game nights and visiting more and more once my excuse about a long car drive is mute. \n\nAs Afton says, it's not cool to show up to your brother-in-law's house only to find the same car that you drive in parked in their driveway(thankfully they're not in a place right now to actually buy the same car my wife has). Walk in the front door to see the same furniture, the same shoes by the door. Have your brother-in-law's girlfriend meet you at the door wearing the same glasses as you, as well as the same dress. That's what Afton doesn't want happening, and she's avoiding interacting with Rebecca at all costs to avoid it. \n\nNext weekend I'm going to attempt to confront my brother about it in person. I'm not going to text him and give Rebecca a chance to try and explain it all away like she has in the past. I don't want to give her a chance to delete more of the evidence of her stalking Afton on social media. I'm going to try and ask him what he thinks is going on, if he thinks it's actually not real, not a problem, etc., and then show him the evidence that Afton has salvaged. This behavior seems to have picked up recently and Afton is now worried that Rebecca has a fake account that she's using to stalk my wife's social media. Afton just locked her account down as much as she could so that nobody except the people that she specifies can see what she posts. I should probably do the same, even though I've basically stopped using social media because of this already. \n\nI just want this to be over with. I wish this problem never existed.\n\nMy first question is: Are we crazy? Are we overreacting? If so, PLEASE tell me and please tell me why. I genuinely feel like I'm crazy half the time and that this shouldn't even be a problem that exists in my life and that I must be making too big a deal out of this.\n\nIf we're not overreacting, what do we do? The easiest answer would be to cut my brother out of my life. I don't want to do that. He's my twin brother and we went through a lot growing up together. He's pretty much the only family that I have at this point. I want him to be an uncle to my children, for my kids to stay at his house. I want things to be good between us, but this is driving such a large rift between us and both Ian and Rebecca both act like it doesn't exist. We can't visit them because surely Afton's latest choice in glasses will be ripped off, or what she was wearing will be the most recent addition to Rebecca's documented fashion sightings of Afton. We most certainly can't invite them over to our house because next thing we know Rebecca will have saved every piece of furniture that we own. What ever happened to being your own person? I'm 23 years old but I feel like I'm experiencing the social problems of a 14 year old.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My wife is going crazy because my twin brother's girlfriend is seemingly stalking her on social media and Pinterest. She's denied doing so every time. Please help me figure out how to confront this issue without a nuke going off on what family I have left.\n\nEDIT 1: My wife is not counter-stalking Rebecca. Rebecca is blocked on everything except Pinterest, and that's to see when my wife recognizes something that she wore last week, or something that I mentioned to my brother showing up on her feed. She's not scouring Rebecca's post history.\n\nEDIT 2: Even if my wife deletes her social media, it's not going to stop Rebecca from finding out about our lives. I would rather not cut my brother out of my life, and Afton can't stop her relatives from posting group photos of her.\n\nEDIT 3: I also think that my wife should ditch social media. That's not what I'm asking advice about. I think it's fairly clear that taking a step back from social media would help her greatly. It wouldn't stop the copycat behavior, which is what we're trying to combat.\n\nEDIT 4: Thanks to each one of you who have contributed to this post. I know that it's probably lighter fare than the usual post on this sub, but I feel that I need help with this situation all the same. I always appreciate outside perspectives and I appreciate every response.\n\nEDIT 5: I'm noticing that the primary concern is that of social media. That's not the issue, and I apologize if I've made it seem that way. The problem is the copying occurring in real life. Social media is just one tool Rebecca tries to use to follow Afton's life. The real problem is that my brother wants us all to be fine and dandy together, but every time Rebecca is in the same room as Afton, it's like Rebecca is just taking mental notes of what Afton is wearing, saying, talking about, etc. That's the real problem and my whole goal is to get my brother to see it and hopefully help in combating this behavior instead of acting like nothing is happening.\n\nEDIT 6: My wife has finished putting together the document that I will use as evidence when I confront my brother this weekend. Apparently LAST year for Valentine's day, my wife posted a picture of herself with one of our cats. THIS YEAR, for Valentine's day, Rebecca posted a picture that's a recreation of the exact photo my wife took the year prior. Rebecca was wearing the same exact pair of glasses(the ones mentioned above), the same hair as she had, as well as the same clothes as my wife, posing with her cat. It's not fun to look at side by side. If this isn't deliberate, then i don't know what is.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationship_advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0cn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/relationship_advice","subreddit_subscribers":2925937,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"How do I(23M) confront my twin brother about his girlfriend(21F) and her copycat\/stalker-like behavior towards my wife(23F)?","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/fblpr1\/how_do_i23m_confront_my_twin_brother_about_his\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I just don't feel like I fit in anywhere. I've almost always felt this way. When I was in elementary school, I was a little more outgoing, always tried to make friends. I don't really know what happened at that point. Got made fun of by kids at school, but I still just wanted to make friends. Parents split up, mom got remarried, had to change schools, blah blah blah. Tried to be friendly, still got made fun of. I noticed even if the kids didn't make fun, they still treated me different. Everyone did. People openly told me I was weird and awkward. That being said, I did try to keep my head up and had a few friends. Anyway, now I'm 32, and a little bit better. Ive had two girlfriends in my life, and I'm married to the second one and I have a child. I honestly can't figure out why she's with me. I still try to be social. Hell,, I play drums in a band and also play guitar. Playing shows and going to shows are literally the only times I feel free for the most part, but still self conscious. That and when I'm drunk lol. Itry to hang with people, but I still get the impression that I'm awkward. One of my friends told me I was not too long ago. I always have to think about the right social cues (eye contact, when to smile, etc.). I'm horrible at small talk, just literally can't think of anything to say. Makes it extremely hard to do introductions and virtually impossible to make new friends. On the rare times someone wants to hear about my interests, I'll talk their head off lol. Occasionally I'll be told that I actually \"held a good conversation\", not by the person I was talking with, but by someone who was told by that person. Im trying things like nofap and working out to help my mental state, but I'm not really noticing many positive effects. Maybe I  just need to put more time into them. Either way, when I say I wish I was just normal and fit in, I damn well mean that. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated. If not, thank you for listening to my rant.

I don't mind if it stays on reddit or migrates to another platform. \nJust send me a fun message to start, tell me where you're from and why you're looking for a fun chat like me?\nMaybe you can start with a secret topic that you love to discuss but no one knows it's your happy topic?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dirtypenpals","subreddit_subscribers":245838,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"33 [M4F] I miss those days of the 'getting to know you by text' excitement after getting a girl's number - Looking for a fun chat","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtypenpals\/comments\/fblvyi\/33_m4f_i_miss_those_days_of_the_getting_to_know\/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}

I have a good job and a good place and will always take care of my loved ones.\n\n Some things about me are...\n\nI am very open minded, I like to experience different cultures, meet new people and hear their point of views in life.\n\nI like food lol. I love going to farmer's markets and cooking new things, and watching cooking shows on YouTube.\n\nI love all kinds of music, it's rare to find something I don't enjoy. I have a guitar and I've been practicing.\n\nI live on my own but I don't have a car. It's all good though since everything is close by. And I have a cat.\n\nI am kinda short, with short brown hair and green eyes. I'm not thin but not really big. I eat healthy and I'm working on getting rid of my chub.

If we talk and it's serious we can revisit that subject. \n\nSomethings I'd like from you is that you are single and looking for a serious relationship down the road. Yep.... that's it.

Their bodies exposed and bare, most not even wearing shoes. They were so daring, yet always on the lookout. Just watching them always sent a shiver through me. I could never do something like that... Right?\n\nThe campus library was huge, built into the side of a hill and sloping downwards. 4 floors, each less populated than the one before it, each decreasing potential risk. Nobody went down to the lowest floors of the building. It was only old texts and microfilm. Nobody even knew how those things worked anyway. Even the most die-hard loners tended to stay on the second floor rather than entering the poorly lit first floor. Maybe I could do something like this...\n\nI waited until it was late at night, hiding away in an isolated nook of the library before I stripped down. I took my first tentative steps, heart pounding as I began sneaking around. I felt the rough carpet against my bare feet as I stepped out without a stitch on my body. I'm utterly naked in the library, living out my secret fantasies. I hadn't seen anyone down here, and the coast seemed clear. Of course, I wasn't expecting you.\n\n****\n\nHi DPP! I'm 22 and I actually am a bit of a nudist! I'm 5'11\" with long dark hair that goes down to just above my butt, and brown eyes.

Overall I'd love to focus on the being caught nude angle more than actual sex. Teasing the girl you caught naked in the library, thinking she wouldn't get caught. Getting me to sneak and streak around, and perhaps even making me your personal streaker in a more long term arrangement!\n\nKinks: Exhibitionism, with ENF and CFNF in particular, D\/s, spankings, teasing, light humiliation, and maybe even romance.\n\nLimits: beast, gore, blood, scat, non-con, bathroom stuff, kids, and death, and I won't respond to anyone who asks me to use kik or discord. Please ask before you try something.\n\nAlso, this prompt is always open!

I need... a lot of help haha. So to anyone who takes the time to help me out, thank you in advance for your patience.\n\nI have been interested in building a gaming PC for some time, but I don't know the first thing about how computers work. I plan to keep with my macbook for daily use, so this PC will primarily be used for gaming, maybe a bit of digital art (using photoshop, clip studio).\n\nI'd love to know why you suggest any given product over another so I can better understand what I'm buying, but please Explain Like I'm 5. Honestly, I don't know much more than what a cursory google search can tell me about what any of this stuff means and even then results are still laden with terminology, so I might know things like \"SSD is better than HDD\" but I couldn't tell you *why*.\n\n**Budget**: $600-$800 USD\n\n**OS:** I'll be purchasing Windows 10 for this\n\n* Question: Can a 64-bit Windows not run 32-bit programs? On pcpartpicker I saw separate product listings for Windows 10 32-bit, 64-bit, and 32\/64-bit and it left me confused.\n\n**Peripherals:**\n\n* I need a monitor, either with built-in speakers, or monitor + speakers if it's cheaper. I'm okay with just \"decent\" sound quality for now\n* I'm currently in possession of a USB mouse and a bluetooth keyboard which I'm hoping will be serviceable for now. On that note, I'm looking into motherboards with built-in wifi, unless you can explain to me what this pcie business is.\n\n**Games I play:** stuff like dragon age, the sims, maybe ffxiv, maybe overwatch\n\n**Location:** I'm in southern california. I'm not conveniently close to a micro center, but it IS a doable distance if going there is really worth the money\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's what I have so far:\n\nEDIT: Have made some changes.

I'll preface by saying I'm 4 years on T and never experienced a voice drop, my voice is pretty much the same as it was pre-T. J started T about a year ago, and his voice started drastically dropping a few months in (the common experience, but one I never had), and since I have extremely bad voice dysphoria I stopped interacting with him. He started going to his college in person and made a bunch of trans guy friends who are like him, having normal transitions with normal changes, experiencing voice drops and everything. \n\nThis year I started pursuing voice surgery, so I thought I should try to reconnect with J. It's not working out so far. He sounds *even deeper* than he did the last time I talked to him, so I can't voice chat with him anymore. We used to play games, draw together, and voice chat all the time before he started T, but now I can't without having a mental breakdown. However, it's clear he doesn't care about having me around anymore... He now has other trans guy friends who are like him and having the expected changes... and I still haven't. I feel left out, left behind, and inadequate. \n\nHell, he was *taught by his trans guy friends* how to do his shots when he first started T. I've been navigating my transition completely alone for more than 4 years. I'm extremely jealous, hurt, and alone. I'm getting voice surgery, but I'll always be less than him and his new best friends. We've talked about this, but it's so obvious that he doesn't consider me to be at his \"level\" anymore because of my voice. \n\nI'm getting voice surgery but I'll never get to experience a natural drop like he and his friends did. I'll never be men like them. I always feel like a little boy when I interact with J, and he's 3 years younger than me.\n\nI don't want to be alone. I want to feel validated and supported, and validate and support. I want to be able to play Apex Legends with other trans guys, using voice chat, and not feel like shit or feel like I'm being looked down on. \n\nI'm typing this in a rush before I run out of the door to work, but I'll be thinking about it all day. I have been the past couple months non-stop, especially with my surgery consultation on the horizon.

I've always worked for the same 501(c)(3) and have been on REPAYE for the past few years. We've done the math: Rather than pay the loans down now that we have combined income it will still save us a bunch of money to stay the course these next three years and apply for forgiveness. We've also compared the figures filing together and separately and it's better for us (surprisingly) to file separately. So the plan is:\n\n(1) File taxes separately  \n(2) Request a new payment plan (PAYE)  \n(3) Recertify my income and expect a monthly payment in line with what it was before I got married (income is similar and I'm even trying to lower my taxable income by putting few bucks into a 401k)\n\nTwo questions: \n\nFirst: Does this sound like a solid plan? Meaning: does switching to PAYE mean they can't touch my wife's income in recalculating my monthly payment?\n\nSecond: Is there any advantage to requesting the switch to PAYE immediately after we're finished with the taxes versus requesting this as a part of the recertification process?

I had dreamed this moment so many times and woke up sad, but one day I finally bought it and experienced the moment for real! Also I included Dreamcast since I only have 3 JRPGs for it. ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/88lykabukyj41.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad605450aead8a46e75cf13f7e73c7af75007e1c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/89p9exhwkyj41.jpg?width=3023&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b63625dd481dd0d0b3045e00c9db2f9eee5d6c2f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ao0v2dkxkyj41.jpg?width=3021&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c4ba5f35d5b0374d41c3590722d42211d127b63\n\nConsoles: Sony and Microsoft\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2rl5z35zkyj41.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dec1f95891f5cb88b139cfca1183aa424d2d976\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConsoles: Nintendo\n\n[Nintendo hasn't had a lot of console JRPGs since the SNES, but what they did have was pretty great.

I thought it was normal to have diarrhea at least 2x a month until a doctor in the hospital told me that healthy people have it like 2x a year.\n\nSoo my journey began when I was 7 or smth like that. I was in the hospital bc of diarrhea, I didn't have pain, just diarrhea. This happened again when I was 16. Now I'm 20 years old. \n\nIn May last year I had a very bad pain in the stomach and explosive diarrhea. My mom took me to the hospital and I've been there for 5 days. They did the whole spectrum of tests; thousand of ultrasounds, mri, colonoscopy, blood tests and checked my whole body. They even chopped off a small piece of my intestine and sent it to the lab. I was feeling better after like 3 days and was allowed to go home. I got salofalk. \n\nThey suspected that it's Crohns but when the results from the lab came in, the Doctor said, that it wouldn't look like Crohns and I could stop taking Salofalk. \n\n\nIn December I was in another hospital. I had the same problems but also had to throw up. They did all the tests again except for the colonoscopy bc the doctor was too worried about doing it too often (I was kinda relieved because the laxative was just too disgusting the last time and I threw up so many times). I was better after a few days again and went home without a 100% safe diagnosis. Just the suspect of Crohns. \n\nBy the way the inflammation was always at the passage of the colon and the small intestine. \n\nNow I'm in great pain again. I'm somehow afraid of going to the hospital and kinda think it's unnecessary because I will just have the same tests again and lay around. \n\nMy questions are:\n1. Do you guys think I have Crohns from what I told you? (I know you are no doctors but I'd be interested)\n2. Do you always go to the hospital when in pain?\n3. Should I go to the hospital or do you think I should make an appointment for another colonoscopy?\n\n\nI'm very sorry if I used a wrong word or wrong grammar. I'm on the phone, English isn't my mother tounge and I had to google a few words.\n\nEDITED bc my dumb ass thought a colonoscopy is called endoscopy","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"CrohnsDisease","subreddit_id":"t5_2s453","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/CrohnsDisease","subreddit_subscribers":27646,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"What do you think?","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CrohnsDisease\/comments\/fbmcpc\/what_do_you_think\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

But realise that is is an addiction and an addiction always comes with a reason, no matter if it's alcohol, drugs or porn. There is a reason deep down inside you, that drives you to this kind of self destructing behavior and you have to learn about that reason, take care of it and treat yourself well.\n\nIn a few days I'm 5 years sober of alcohol and chemical drugs and 4 years non-smoker, abusing all of it heavily for multiple years. And if there's one thing I found out throughout those years, talking a lot in therapy and groups, it's that addiction has always a lot to do with missing self-love and self-care and the best way to deal with it, is to finally give you this love and attention that you've been missing for most of your life. So when you are telling yourself that you are disgusting and you don't deserve better, you're making this already hard way that you chose, even harder.\n\nAnd by the way, only to choose this way is already an achievement, in those 5 years being sober I realized a lot how many people are actually addicted to some shit and how little choose to face it and start to deal with it. Because dealing with it means to take responsibility for yourself and your life and that's where most people already chicken out and rather blame the reason for there problems on someone else.\n\nSo what I'm saying is basically only: try to be a little bit gentle with yourself, probably by the root of your problems, you are just feeling lonely and missing love and attention and there's truly no reason to be ashamed of that. But because we can't expect the world to give us what we need, we should try to give it to ourselfs.\n\nBy the way, even though I'm sober from alcohol since 5 years, I'm still struggling with porn. Trying to quit that shit since years but in contrast to alcohol and drugs, I never spoke to anyone about it in all those years. Just found out about \/nofap before two weeks or so and since then, I'm feeling really optimistic that I can finally start to handle this as well. Record was something like 6 weeks I think, never really counted, right now I'm at 4 weeks I think.\n\nSo thanks a lot to this community, because I never spoke about this, it always felt kinda isolated and now that I'm reading your posts, I feel like it's another big step for me to get rid of the next (and hopefully last) big addiction I'm dealing with.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"NoFap","subreddit_id":"t5_2skrn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/NoFap","subreddit_subscribers":588467,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"You are not disgusting","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/NoFap\/comments\/fbme61\/you_are_not_disgusting\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

My whole life I have grown up with a very overbearing mother. I would go as far to say that she is emotionally abusive to both my sister and I. However, she is emotionally abusive and manipulative in a very sly way. Always dangling money and gifts over our heads. My father and I have no connection. He makes no effort to try and get along or even talk with me. For instance when I told him I applied to grad school all the said was \u201cyea\u201d. Tonight my sister and I both took a mental health quiz and it said we were both suffering with dependent personality disorder. We are so codependent on our parents. Keep in mind I am 22 and my sister is 33. Every thought or action I have is ran through the lens of what my parents would think about it. Neither of us have any self esteem or worth. We are living in the south. A very conservative and redneck part of the south. I am also gay (parents do not support this at all) and stick out like a sore thumb around here because I take pride in how I look. I have a BFA in art from a private school. However, I constantly feel like I am ignorant and viewed as a loser\/idiot. My degree is not good enough or valid for other people. Recently I applied to an art graduate program in St Louis. This would be a ticket out of this hell hole for me. However, when I tell people St Louis they tell me I will hate it and should move to New York instead. So now I feel like St Louis is not good enough. However, it is too late to apply to other grad programs due to deadlines passing. Overall I just feel like a total waste and that I am never going to be good enough.

I didn't get any responses with helpful information, so I'm reposting the relevant info I gave then below. Since I made my first post, I've lost **ALL HEARING** in my right ear. I'm sorry if this isn't kosher, I'm just so afraid and frustrated and helpless. \n\nI'm a white American transgender woman (assigned male at birth, transitioning to female). I live in Ames, IA. I'm 24, am 5'11\" and weigh about 205 lbs. As a child, I had frequent ear infections and had to have tubes put in. I don't listen to loud music, am not exposed to loud noises in the course of my day, and don't go to any loud concerts. I take:\n\n \u2022 lamotrigine, as one 25 mg tablet once a day\n\n \u2022 estradiol, as one 2mg tablet sublingually twice a day\n\n \u2022 spironolactone, as one 100mg tablet twice a day\n\n \u2022 Wellbutrin XL, three 150mg tablets once a day\n\n \u2022 zyrtec, as one 10mg tablet once a day. \n\nI have been having constant ear problems for almost two months. I experienced sudden onset of tinnitus in my left ear on January 9th, and went to a doctor two days later. In those ensuing two days, i started to feel intermittent pain in both ears and light pressure. The doctor I saw diagnosed me with an ear infection, saying that my left eardrum was bulging but my right eardrum was fine. She prescribed me oral Doxycycline, which I started, but had a bad reaction (severe vomiting and an episode of extreme confusion) and stopped the course of antibiotics at the advice of a doctor. It took her 5 days to get back to me and prescribe another antibiotic, despite my constant calls; my ears continued to worsen and the ringing continued. She prescribed me oral Cefdinir, and over the 10-day course, I had no improvement. I took every dose exactly as directed. \n\nWhen I called the doctor who initially saw me (this was approx. January 26th), she said there was nothing more she could do to help and referred me to the ENT department at her clinic. Unfortunately, only one of the three ENTs at her clinic will accept adult patients, which meant the soonest I could see a specialist specialist was March 26th. I was outraged by this but I felt that there was little to nothing I could do. I resigned myself to hoping the symptoms would clear on their own, before late March.\n\nThat didn't happen. During the month of February, the pain became less frequent, but it was still there and continues to be there; I've had episodes of pain in both ears. When I first came down with this, the pain was dull, but it's become sharp and stabbing. I have constant ringing in my left ear, and intermittent ringing episodes in my right ear. I grudgingly accepted this, thinking that there was little I could do but wait. A few days ago, I started sneezing and developed a postnasal drip. A kid in one of my college classes who's been sneezing and coughing for a while coughed directly into my face shortly before the sneezing started, so I feel like that's likely why I'm sneezing.\n\nOn Thursday night, the hearing in my right ear went quiet. Not completely quiet, but significantly quieter than normal. This happened while I was reading. I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary or exposed to loud noises. I consulted my girlfriend and Google, and concluded that my sudden hearing loss was a medical emergency and we went to the ER. They took me in, asked a few questions, and a doctor came. He seemed concerned not about my hearing, but the sneezing I've had for the past few days. He looked into my ears and noted fluid buildup in my left ear, but said nothing about my right ear, the one with hearing loss. He ordered a nose swab and wanted to check me for flu for some reason. He said that that was all he could do for me, because \"we treat heart attacks and stab wounds here, not hearing loss.\" I tested negative for everything, and advised I try a nasal spray, wait until my specialist appointment in a month, and \"hope things don't get worse.\"\n\nMy hearing hasn't come back. I called the doctor who first saw me for the \"ear infection,\" to ask if she could try to do something to get me in faster, but she won't be in her office for another 5 days. I asked to be put through to the ENT department, to notify them of the alarming development of my symptoms and to ask if I could be seen sooner than a month from now. The receptionist told me that they had no openings, and that I wasn't the only one with hearing loss and I needed to wait my turn. I called the hospital in my hometown (which about 250 miles from me), and they told me they had no openings until April, but would try contact people in ENT who were at lunch, and told me they would get back to me. That didn't happen. I called everywhere I could find in my state that has ENTs, but I still couldn't find anywhere that accepts new adult patients that had an opening before March 26th. \n\nGiven that my ear problems have gone nowhere but downhill, I'm terrified that I'm going to completely lose hearing in one or both ears **(and my fears have been realized)**. I know my ER won't help, and I don't know what else I can do without them. I have no idea where to go or what to do. Could someone please give me advice? Where can I go that might actually have a chance of getting my hearing back before it's too late? Do most ERs not have any way of treating things like this? Going deaf is one of my greatest fears and I've been suicidal ever since the ER told me was out of luck. I just want my ear problems to stop.\n\n**TL;DR \"ear infection\" has been going on for 2 months, resisted treatment, and caused me to go deaf in one ear. ER told me they can't help and the soonest I can see a specialist is in a month. What can I do to get this seen before the deafness becomes permanent?**","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskDocs","subreddit_id":"t5_2xtuc","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AskDocs","subreddit_subscribers":219196,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I've gone COMPLETELY deaf in one ear and the ER has told me they can do nothing to help.

I'm not sure if my mother is necessarily a narcissist, but I'm sure she's emotionally abusive. Here's a list of things she does that are flat out awful. Please let me know what you think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Ever since I was little, anytime I wanted something that would bring me joy like a toy or a snack from a store, my mom always shamed me because we were poor. As I grew older, I found out that we weren't poor. In fact, we were quite wealthy. On top of that, my dad gave my mom $1,000 a month for child support for me, and none of that was ever spent on me. Instead she spent it on herself or saved it for vacations that only she would go on.\n2. I have an older sister who's older by 13 years. She's spent 19 years of her life (from freshman year of college) trying to become a doctor. She has extreme anger issues and will constantly blow up at my mom for little things, resulting in her even yelling in my mom's face when my grandma died. My mom didn't pick out a photo my sister liked for grandma's funeral and instead of having a civil conversation about changing it my sister started yelling at my mother while she was crying. These anger issues eventually resulted in my sister being expelled from her residency program as a doctor. After 19 years, she was six months away from becoming a doctor, but apparently her anger issues were so bad that she was arguing with her patients and superiors, resulting in her being expelled from her program. Despite her often yelling and having fits of anger that last days, my mom is always coming to her defense. The day my sister yelled at my mom for choosing a bad photo of my grandmother, I told her to ease up since my mom's mom just died. My sister turned her rage towards me, telling me that I needed to \"black myself out\" (her strange phrasing not mine) and just ignore her since I've been ignoring her since she's been home (we're no contact but we live in the same house, I just avoid her at all costs). After this my sister proceeded to mock me, yell at me within inches of my face, all while my mom made me apologize. Once I did say sorry and went upstairs to remove myself, my mom told me that she makes me apologize since my sister doesn't know any better.\n3. My sister being expelled from her medical program was apparently the worst thing that happened to my mom. She lied to all her friends about it, saying my sister was sick instead. Whenever my sister was mean to her, my mom would come downstairs and complain to me about how awful my sister is, how obvious it is that my sister got expelled from her medical program because of her anger issues. How my sister had gotten dosages of medication wrong, and all these very specific things that led to my sister being expelled. However, once my mom was in a good mood and I would ask her about these things, my mom would lie to my face and tell me that she never said these things. She would just shut her eyes tight and shake her head and say that I'm lying, and that it's awful I would lie about something as serious as my sister's termination.\n4. My mom bought my sister a house a few years ago and told me about it. My sister now rents out the house and makes a considerable amount of extra income from the rent. Now, a few years later, I got upset at my mom for giving my sister so much leeway and even buying her a house. My mom now is saying that she never bought my sister the house and that my sister bought it herself. She's saying that my sister worked for years so of course she saved up with enough money to buy a house. I know that's completely false and there's no way my sister has saved up enough money to buy that house herself while working low-paying jobs and paying her own rent. Plus, she told me that she paid for it and now she's just switching up her story.\n5. My mom decided to get my kitchen remodeled. I'm 24 and just now got a job. My mom constantly complains about how poor she is to me and tries to get me to pity her. She's constantly saying she has no money and works so hard, so I was pretty surprised that she said she's remodeling the kitchen. When I asked her who's paying for it, she told me that I'm going to pay for it. With my new job. I asked her if I could pick out the cabinets and she said no. When I told her I didn't want to pay for it if I couldn't choose what I liked, she got upset at me.\n6. To make up for the fact that she never bought me a house, my mom promised me our house we live in now. It's a pretty nice house, worth half a million dollars. She keeps saying how I'm really getting the good deal since our house is worth more than my sister's two houses combined (I think she also bought my sister the second house but at this point she's acting like the second house never even happened even though I'm pretty sure it did, my sister just sold it so it's easier to pretend like she didn't buy it for her. I can't even tell anymore). She's acting like I'm so lucky to get this house since it's worth so much. Thinking in this context doesn't even make sense however, because I would have to wait until my mom passed to even have this house (I know this sounds awful but she keeps telling me how I'm getting more money in the end) and my sister has the value of her two houses plus years of rent money she's received from renting out the houses, resulting in her getting way more money than half a million dollars. My mom acts like I'm incredibly lucky and tries to act like my ally, like she's nudging me with her elbow saying she's really treating me better and giving my sister the shorter end of the stick even though we know that's not true.\n7. My whole life my sister has been emotionally abusive to my mother and me, constantly throwing temper tantrums and going to extremes to control my family. She'll make it so I have to be exactly where she wants to be at what times, lies to get me to stop hanging out with my friends so I can keep her company (she has no friends except one friend who's on the spectrum that she clearly verbally abuses constantly), and violently cries while shaking when things don't go her way and holding us emotionally hostage no longer pans out. Despite my mom constantly acknowledging all of this to me, when anything difficult happened in my childhood my mom would put my sister in charge of punishing me and would always just tell me to \"do whatever my sister said or she'll get mad.\" My mom constantly acted like she had no agency, when clearly she could've set boundaries. Whenever I mention to my mom that she can put a stop to my sister by telling her these things aren't acceptable in her house, she acts like I'm suggesting kicking my sister out. She's Chinese so she's huge on family (even though I've never felt any maternal love or warmth from her, instead emotionally it just feels like she's always trying to get me to pity her) so she acts like I'm an awful person for suggesting she turns her back on her family.\n8. Every time I bring up how upset I am by these things, she'll just ignore me. She'll literally pretend like she doesn't hear me, even if I'm crying. I know she can hear me, but she'll just look at her ipad and even scroll down on whatever she's reading as if she's making a point that she truly is ignoring me. I've fought with her a couple of times and every time I'm the one saying sorry, with her saying I truly was horrible and that I really should apologize more. In spite of her pretending to be this sad poor, hardworking kind woman, she's never said sorry to me about anything she's done. Not once. That really gets under my skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I know that was a lot, but I really need some insight because I'm incredibly upset. I just had a big fight with her where she told me that I've \"always hated her\" and while it's true I've never bent over backwards to accommodate her, it feels like what she wants from me is impossible to give her without erasing part of myself. Every time I try to address any of this, it feels like I'm talking to a brick wall. I'm in disbelief that my own mother could be mean to me. If the things she does are truly bad, does that mean I'm messed up too? Do I have a chance of being normal or will I always be subjected to living this emotionally unstable life? If my mother is truly awful, should I try to apologize to at least get her to give me the house for financial stability? I'm not sure what to do.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_subscribers":558102,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Is my mother a narcissist?","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/fbmnq8\/is_my_mother_a_narcissist\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I am 41 and have had an opiate addiction since I was 20 when I hurt my back. I have stayed on some type of opiate with a few times I'd stay sober for a month or so, then right back in it. As I hot older it got harder to quit so I never did or tried, fuck it I worked my ass off I figured this is my reward. Well the pills got to expensive so I went to heroin for the past 5 years, then I was introduced to Buprenorphine i.e subutex and suboxone the last 4 years. So I tried to stay away from the black and just stick with taking the Bupe the way I was supposed to. Nope that didn't last long, I found you could snort the Subutex and get a decent high that lasted for a while. Before I knew it I was snorting up to 8mg a day, back to the black tar when I didn't have Bupe. \n\n  Over Christmas I said fuck it I am done with it all, tired if chasing it, spending my money on it, just being an all around piece of shit, told my wife I have a problem, I am an addict and I need help. First step. Very emotional night that night. Still had dope and pills so said fuck it when that's gone I'm done, Jan 13th I snorted the last little chunk of Subutex I had, cut a couple lines of the last bit of Tina I had, snorted one, saved the other for later, did the last line about 5. Looked at my stash box had a few minutes of panic if I could do this or not, pulled my shit together and knew this was it, for some unknown reason I KNEW this was my last shot at sobriety. If I didn't take it I was a dead man walking. I was laid off in December so I didn't have to rush out and get a job right away thank god. \n\n  On the morning of Jan 14th I started my journey through my own hell on earth, of my own making. Day 1 and 2 wasn't too bad except for the no sleep. Day 3 I knew it was going to get bad, no sleep, the anxiety REALLY kicked in on that day, I couldn't stay still because my whole body hurt so fuckin bad, every muscle felt like it was in a spasm. My back was ABSOLUTELY killing me, every joint in my body felt like it had glass poured into it. Through all that I had NO energy, I could make it to the bathroom to piss and back to my bed, fuck going anywhere else. As the day went on it steadily got worse. My wife, god love her, had no idea what I was going through but thought just because she read up on it she knew what was going on and every comment or question she made just made it worse until I was yelling at the top of my lungs for her to fuck off and leave me to myself and all my misery.\n\n But alas she thinks she can always fix me and stayed with me, that night going into day 4 with no sleep since day 1 I was literally out of my mind. Between the anxiety, I didn't get nervous legs, I got nervous body. I wanted out of my skin so bad, pouring sweat, tingling, shaking uncontrollably, cold chills, I would try to get up and walk around the room or house to see if that would help ANY but I couldn't be up very long I just didn't have the OOMPH to do it. When I did push myself beyond what my body told me it could handle it taught me a lesson, I came too with my wife panicking over top of me trying to get my naked ass off the floor. Back to bed for more torment I went!! Thankfully I didn't get the shits or puking my stomach lining up this time but god damn did I make up for it in sweating. This was the worst and longest night of my life, but unfortunately it got worse. \n\n  Ahh my personal day in hell and my guide was Lucifer himself, with no sanity left, because I thought he was there with me. All the time telling me all I had to do was make a call and everything would be back to normal. Why was I doing this to myself, how can I stand the pain, mental anguish, anxiety, I literally lost my mind and god damn it was scary for a long time. I was two people, one that knew this was the only way to get and stay clean, because after all I am an addict. There is no self management where the opiates were concerned. I couldn't manage my life being hooked to that shit anymore. I HAD to do this. On the other side was the one who operated on a basic primalistic level that wanted nothing more then to escape the pain, mental torture, the overwhelming anxiety I would die or at the very least come out of this a scarred man. I deserved to get high, that was my reward for the hardwork I put in, it was okay this time we can do it, we can manage it but for the love of god PLEASE GET HIGH AND GET US OUT OF THIS SELF IMPOSED HELL. \n\n  My adult son heard and seen me reduced to a bellowing, screaming, crying lunatic that day. I remember screaming that I hated what I have done to myself and my family. I hated being a slave to a drug like this. But other then that my memory is foggy of that day. He said I screamed until my voice gave out, but I never slept. That evening when my wife got home from work I remember vividly, begging her to please take me to get some dope or pills, ANYTHING. She obviously refused and I found the strength to get dressed, grab my wallet, keys, and phone, head downstairs to the front door where I KNEW if I went out that door I'd never come back. I told my wife before I started detoxing I would never go back and if I did I was dead. Either by an overdose or ending my own life either way it would be by my own hands, I would be a slave to this shit NO MORE. My wife helped me back upstairs, screaming the whole time, helped me get back into clean lazy clothes and back into bed where I continued to beg for dope or death, telling her she didn't love me if she didn't get me high, she was a horrible wife, wasn't worth a fuck, was her fault I was there etc. I tried anything my fucked up mind thought would work. I laid there raving and screaming until THANK GOD I finally passed out and went to sleep. \n\n  Now I am not a religious man by far but I prayed for my soul that night. I was completely destroyed, I had nothing left. As i said before i lived minute to minute for about 36 hours. I prayed God would take me or help me, although I preferred death I'd take either one. I don't remember going to sleep, my wife said I was in the middle of hollering and praying I just nodded out. I slept for a glorious....... 2 hours. But it helped some, it was after midnight and I had the common decency not to yell, as much, I was still pretty out of it. Even started looking for my gun, fuck it if praying to the almighty didn't produce results I would. She obviously thought ahead and hid the two I keep at arms length, I didn't have the strength to go downstairs and look for the other one. I found out a couple days later she had a friend of mine take all the guns out of the house. Fuck it, I'm done. I just laid there in torment for I don't know how long, I must have finally went to sleep and got about 6 hours of sleep. \n\n  Before I fully woke up I knew everything had changed and for the good. When I actually opened my eyes and looked at the fan I knew I had turned a corner. I had the clearest head I'd had in a very long time. I could actually think straight and it wasn't clouded. The physical shit was still intense but no where NEAR the day before, I asked my daughter if she would fix me some toast and maybe 2 eggs scrambled. All I had to eat up to this point was grapes and oranges. I was hungry as fuck. I had to battle with myself to keep the food down but as the day went on the physical parts started getting easier. I was happy but I knew I was only half way there. But it got so much better from day 5. But no matter what I did or ate my energy was zero. \n\n  I still didn't sleep more then 2 or 3 hours at a time but it was restful sleep. Until I would wake up in a panic attack and have to talk myself down. That lasted up until a couple of weeks ago. But I knew I was on the other side. The worst of the withdrawls were behind me and for the first time in TWENTY years I started thinking about life without opiates dictating all that I did. A couple times this overwhelmed me and threw me into a panic attack but I was able to talk myself down pretty quick. I thought since I had beat the worst of the physical withdrawls I was GRAVY and didn't have shit to worry about. I hadn't left my house in 2 weeks by this time. I tried a couple times and almost had a meltdown. I couldn't deal with other people and their bullshit while I was still raw, hell it's still hard now. \n\n   LMFAO how wrong I was. I KNEW that I had used to keep certain emotions, things that had happened to me in life I wanted to avoid dealing with or thinking about, the death of my mom who died from a very aggressive cancer but I was fortunate enough to take care of her during that time and got to spend alot of time with her, she was the rock of our family, my unhappiness with my marriage and the woman I chose to marry, alot of issues I just wanted to avoid. ALL that shit hit me like a tidal wave. On top of that I was and I still am struggling to find out who I REALLY am. I tried keeping busy with all the things I enjoyed to do before and during my addiction and none of it gave me satisfaction or any kind of joy. SOOOO the first couple times I had all of that hit me at once I was overloaded and overwhelmed and had NO idea how to deal with all of it at once like that. My thoughts would just scatter, I couldn't think straight at all, couldn't focus on one thought or one thing more then a few seconds before something else would hit me. \n\n  I feel completely and utterly lost and hopeless when this happens, I get such a sense of doom or emptiness I honestly feel there is no reason to keep living such a fucked up existence, I'm never going to find my way or myself. When it gets this bad all I want is quiet, alone time and my kids ask my wife if they have done something to upset me. I have tried to explain to her when I get like that ANY little thing that annoys me sends me into a white hot rage that I can't control, so it's in everyone's best interest I just go to our bedroom and try to work it out before I fly off the handle and say shit I will regret later on. She says she understands but I can tell it bothers her and frustrates her when I get like this. Now I have all that on top of now berating myself for making my family think it's THEIR fault I'm like this. That just adds to the self loathing I have for myself for everything I have put them through during my addiction. I am going in Tuesday to see about an IOP for the mental issues I'm having. The episodes aren't as intense now as I took a day to REALLY look at what I have been carrying and is it worth carrying a little longer to somehow work it out. I dumped alot of shit I have carried that makes no sense in carrying anymore. It's made it easier to deal with the emotional tidal waves when they come out of nowhere. \n\n  But I still have days when I feel like I am losing it. I don't know what to do, i don't know who I am, I've never been one to question myself and I find I do that alot lately. And this rage I have worries me and that speaks volumes to those close to me because I've always had a bad temper when it came to certain things. But now say I get cut off I'm ready to follow the motherfucker and drag him outta the vehicle and kick his ass. In public if I'm ran into or if someone does have the courtesy to step to the side and run into me I'm in their face before I realize it. If I cant get this under control I'm going to hurt someone OR get my ass beat. But I will NEVER go back, only option for me is forward.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"OpiatesRecovery","subreddit_id":"t5_2tkk8","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OpiatesRecovery","subreddit_subscribers":24594,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My journey thus far day 46 clean.

My whole life I have grown up with a very overbearing mother. I would go as far to say that she is emotionally abusive to both my sister and I. However, she is emotionally abusive and manipulative in a very sly way. Always dangling money and gifts over our heads. My father and I have no connection. He makes no effort to try and get along or even talk with me. For instance when I told him I applied to grad school all the said was \u201cyea\u201d. Tonight my sister and I both took a mental health quiz and it said we were both suffering with dependent personality disorder. We are so codependent on our parents. Keep in mind I am 22 and my sister is 33. Every thought or action I have is ran through the lens of what my parents would think about it. Neither of us have any self esteem or worth. We are living in the south. A very conservative and redneck part of the south. I am also gay (parents do not support this at all) and stick out like a sore thumb around here because I take pride in how I look. I have a BFA in art from a private school. However, I constantly feel like I am ignorant and viewed as a loser\/idiot. My degree is not good enough or valid for other people. Recently I applied to an art graduate program in St Louis. This would be a ticket out of this hell hole for me. However, when I tell people St Louis they tell me I will hate it and should move to New York instead. So now I feel like St Louis is not good enough. However, it is too late to apply to other grad programs due to deadlines passing. Overall I just feel like a total waste and that I am never going to be good enough.
