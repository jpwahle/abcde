Our school has a tie-required dress code, but I'm one of around 10% of students who choose to dress a bit over the requirement (longwinded reasons behind this; basically, shows professionalism and is an appreciated change from the army of sweaters). \n\nThis means I will usually wear a (casual) blazer of some form to class (over a dress shirt and tie).\n\nThis works out fine for the fall and the spring. I have around 4-5 blazers, none very expensive, that I rotate through and match to the rest of the outfit: navy blue casual blazer, khaki corduroy, grey, dark blue, etc.\n\nThe problem is that in the winter, it becomes too cold to wear only a blazer. On very cold days, I have to give up my habit (which makes me sad) and just wear a dress shirt, only for the purpose of having it fit underneath my winter jacket. It's a ski-type down jacket, which means that the bottom of my blazer peaks out from underneath. This is a show-stopper.\n\nI have looked through all the guides on winter coats, but none of them seem to work.\n\n- Very formal coats are not in the running because no one else at school wears them. I don't want to look like a try-hard; I'm already walking a fine line.\n- Long coats are also not very appropriate, it seems. Anything that covers too much looks silly.\n- It has to be large enough to fit over a blazer, but small enough not to look bulky on me. Some of the coats I have tried seem to crush me. (I am 5'9\", skinny/average)\n- Some of the other students at our school who do the same thing I do have a larger casual jacket that covers up the entire blazer (looks like [this](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/outerwear/cotton/PRDOVR~03761/03761.jsp)). I am keeping this around as an option.\n\nDo you guys have any suggestions or tips for what I should do? I don't exactly have a huge budget, being a student and all.","media":null,"domain":"self.malefashionadvice","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1388534492","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"malefashionadvice","title":"Need a (hopefully cheap) winter coat suggestion: over blazer, yet not very formal, for the NE","secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1u4kyx/need_a_hopefully_cheap_winter_coat_suggestion/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"created":1388534492,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r65t","edited":false,"score":3,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_1u4kyx","id":"1u4kyx","archived":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":9,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"brdd"}

To be honest it wasn't too bad.  They taped my dick to my belly.  He clean it up with this pink stuff.  Gave me a couple numbing shots.  He didn't use a scalpel.  He used the point of medical scissors and poked a hole in my sack.  He rotated my right ball around until he could see the tube through the hole.  He used the scissors to pry the tube out of the hole.  He then put stitches in the tube one on each side.  Then her snipped out the middle of the tube and cauterized each of the new ends of the tube.  Then he would take the clamps off wiggle my sack and the tube would go back through the hole in my sack.  He did the same for the other side through the same hole in my sack and then gave me two stitches to close it up.

Not because I don't trust her with my secrets. I just d on't she would handle it well. \n\nI told her, a couple of days ago, that I'll probably die before I turn 30. Either by my own hand, or an overdose on some illegal substance.\n \nShe woke me up the same night, crying, and said that she had gotten scared when I talked about my death, and that she couldn't bare the thought of me going away. Now don't get me wrong. I love that girl. But right now she is the only thing that is keeping me alive. If I would, oh some happy day, grow the balls big enough to actually face death, she would probably kill herself days after I would be gone. I would kill her.

Bad feels.\nI hated myself for loving it, because I had imagined a ironical present that we would have laughed at it and shared a laugh. But I loved it.\nAnd I couldnt give her anything. At all. \nShe never gets what she deserves from me. All she gets is me trying and failing.  Failing on finding a new job (oh yeah I lost my job a month ago), failing to comfort her when she needs it by saying something stupid and make it worse. Failing on being sober. Failing at being a man. Big ol' Failure-Andy. \nI can't say anything to anyone. They don't understand me. And it's not them. Then it would be understandable, It's me, being a socially awkward, introverted weirdo with weird thoughts. \nI don't wanna see a therapist. Strangers actually scare me. This takes alot of my insignificant courage, just spilling this out. \n\nMy parents hate me. My dad left. 4 times. My bipolar mother either doesn't care or is mad at me for some reason. My brother and I are like strangers. And he doesn't care. Shit... Neither do I. \nDifferent types of juvenile correctional places made me into a introverted loner. The sober life wasn't  an alternative. Being released from my correctional sentence, I tried to become a musician, I even worked in a Studio. But the boss there was using me to get money from the sate, so I shot that dream in the face, and realised, that i would never become what I wanted to be. I earlier studied Theatre and would probably be at the Royal Drama School if i wasn't a junkie. \n\nIm not gonna survive this year. Im not gonna survive myself. \nI don't want to survive. I just want it all to end.\n\nHappy New Year, Andy.

I have seen a foot doctor several times &amp; they all say the only solution is to wear insoles. The insoles would provide temporary relief but no long term comfort. The current shoes I wear running fit well and have nice arch support, so I'm ruling that out. I have also noticed that my thighs get extremely strained and practically give out by the end of my run, even with stretching thoroughly before &amp; after.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions to alleviate the pains I experience?","retrieved_on":1441978049,"ups":4,"permalink":"/r/C25K/comments/1u4oap/w2d3_as_a_non_runner/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","title":"W2D3 as a non runner","secure_media_embed":{},"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"C25K","created_utc":"1388537196","author_flair_text":"W7D3","domain":"self.C25K","hide_score":false,"quarantine":false,"score":4,"edited":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/comments/1u4oap/w2d3_as_a_non_runner/","secure_media":null,"created":1388537196,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rgoq","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"author":"townpass","from":null,"is_self":true,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"num_comments":3,"author_flair_css_class":"7","id":"1u4oap","archived":true,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_1u4oap","link_flair_css_class":null}

A year ago, I was diagnosed with ADHD, General Anxiety Disorder, and mild depression. After months of trying different medications and lifestyle changes, not much had improved. 3 weeks ago, I took an 1/8th of shrooms. For 3 weeks, my symptoms have completely vanished.**\n\nI'm a 22-year-old college student, and for as long as I can remember, I've had this persisting case of anxiety that dictated my behavior in virtually every moment of my life. I don't know how or why it started, but it never went away. It's made my life a nightmare at times, when it really shouldn't be at all. This anxiety, in turn, fueled bouts of depression that could last for days or weeks before subsiding for a short amount of time.\n\nA year ago this month, I went to see a doctor to figure out why. He diagnosed me with ADHD, and said it would explain the consistent anxiety and resulting depression. After researching, I came to realize many of my quirks and oddities were actually symptoms of the ADHD. Until then, I just assumed that I was simply less adjusted than most people my age and had more minute character flaws. It was relieving, to say the least, to learn that this wasn't the case. I had a chemical imbalance in my brain that was causing most, if not all, of these issues.\n\nThe following months consisted of trying out different ADHD medications at various dosages to see if they made any kind of difference. Adderall XR had a very obvious effect, but not the same effects that someone without ADHD would feel. I didn't feel wired and jittery, like I'd just taken meth. I felt more calm, relaxed, and in control of my emotions. I stayed on that for a few months, but I did notice that I wasn't sleeping or eating as well. So I switched to Vyvanse, which I liked better. It had a more gradual come-on and come-down, and the side-effects were minimal. I still had trouble sleeping, but that's been the case for years. Nothing new there. But something was still 'off'. Sure, I could now focus on more things at will, I could better organize my thoughts and actions appropriately, and I could plan my life beyond the immediate future. But I wasn't feeling any happier, I was still riding this roller coaster of emotions throughout each week, and I was still fighting with myself over the simplest things.\n\nOn somewhat of a whim, my friend and I decided to take an 1/8th of shrooms one night about 3 weeks ago. We'd both dropped acid a few times before and absolutely loved it. So we were excited to try shrooms for the first time. My shroom trip was very similar to my acid trips, only more profound. Along with the visuals, I came to a lot of realizations about myself, the issues I'd been dealing with, my place in the universe, my own potential, what I care about, what is trivial to me, what kind of life I want to live, and so on. It was the most revealing trip I've ever experienced. I loved it.\n\nI slept very well after my come-down. It wasn't the kind of sleep you get after an exhausting acid trip. It was more natural. More relaxing. I can't remember if I dreamt about anything, but I do remember waking up feeling better than I had in years. The average morning for me usually starts with thick brain fog, grogginess, and mental and physical exhaustion. Very poor sleep. However, after my shroom trip, I woke up feeling completely rested. I was in an unusually good mood. Instead of thinking, 'Just try to have a good day...', I felt strangely motivated to *make* it a good day. I'd never really felt that before. It was almost unsettling, but in the best way possible.\n\nSince then, every morning has felt like that. I wake up feeling happy and motivated. I don't lie in bed, dreading the day ahead, only getting up when I'm tired of feeling like a worthless human being. No. I wake up in a good mood, ready to have a good day. As a result, my days are good. I'm happy the entire time, I'm more sociable, energetic, motivated, and productive. It's liberating. It's exciting. I now look forward to my day, instead of the end of it.\n\nI'm not sure what happened. Maybe the shrooms 'reset' something in my brain. Maybe they adjusted some chemical imbalance. Maybe my realizations fueled some subconscious motivation that hasn't been able to surface at any time in my life. Or maybe the shrooms are completely unrelated and I'm making connections that aren't really there. I honestly don't know. But after hearing similar stories before, I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI just wanted to share with you guys the unbelievable experience I've had. I don't even know if anyone will read this, but I don't care. My life has changed for the better, and it all started the day after I took shrooms for the first time. I thought someone here might appreciate that.","media":null,"name":"t3_1u4ro3","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"id":"1u4ro3","archived":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":31,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"[deleted]","stickied":false,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh7l","created":1388539961,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1u4ro3/for_years_ive_been_dealing_with_symptoms_of_adhd/","secure_media":null,"edited":false,"score":53,"quarantine":false}

I've spent 13 years taking care of my mother's children; I am the oldest of 5. My mother works 10 hour shifts 5 days a week. My stepdad is this lazy bum who does nothing but sit on his ass all day. He doesn't cook. He never cleans. He won't even help take care of his own children. He acts like they are my responsibility. My parents also suck at parenting. 95% of their interaction with their 3 year old son consists of them yelling at him or disciplining them. On the other hand, I feed them, change them, and give them all the attention that I can to make up for their shitty parents. I am very gentle and consistent with them when it comes to discipline as well. My younger siblings love me more than their own parents. The other day, my siblings and my mother were trying to move a giant rug we have in the living room. My stepdad is sitting on his ass watching us and starts criticizing me. I tell him, \"I'm working as hard as I can, you're the one sitting down.\" And then him and my mother tag team against me and start telling me what a horrible, selfish daughter I am. How they do so much work (they don't even wash their own dishes) and how I never help anyone. They were the one's who sabotaged my work schedule by taking the only transportation I have and leaving me stranded with their kids at home, but I'm the selfish one. They got me fired, and it took me all year to find a new job. Later that day, my stepfather blamed me for not watching his daughter while he was home doing nothing. He rants at me for 20 minutes and says I make their lives more difficult. Wtf? I've provided my parents with free babysitting for 13 years, and I've made their lives more difficult? I hate them. I wish I could move out, but I don't have any money (I start my new job in a few days) or my own car... I've been thinking about dorming at my college, but it would put me in so much debt and I can't really make it very far without transportation. I don't know what to do. I wish I could just die so they would realize that what they said about me was wrong, but at this point, if I died they would probably say \"Good riddance!\" And that's what hurts me the most.\n\nTL;DR: I'm stuck with shitty parents."}

I honestly don't know where to begin. I suppose i'll start by saying that I'm 18 and am currently attending a local college while living with my parents, more on that later i suppose. I'm in need of some serious advice, reddit. Honestly, i'm disgusted with myself right now and I'm trying to seek out some level headed help. \n\nAs i said before I'm 18 and i'm currently attending local college here. I moved from the northern part of the united states to the southern part about 5 years ago and it's really taken its toll on me. I figure i should go into detail about what i plan to do academically, for it comes into reference later on. My plan is that i hope to complete my AA locally then transfer to a college 2 hours north of where i live now to pursue foreign studies. My grades are in my opinion, somewhat above average, so i don't think getting into my dream college is going to be a matter of grades. Maybe money, but I'm in the process of figuring that out now. Anyway, i just finished up my first semester of college and up until now i have never evaluated my life as in depth as i have been the past week or so. \n\nAs the title suggests, i think by most standards, I'm a Hikikomori. For those who don't know what those are, they're practically people who refuse to leave their house and, thus, isolate themselves from society in their homes for a period exceeding six months. I guess an important fact here to add in is that i only have one friend, in real life that is. [Much more on my online games] I do have another but he lives in Columbia and visits once in a blue moon. And right now, actually, my only friend is visiting him in Columbia right this second. Anyway, I'm a shut in who rarely ever gets out, save for school and buying occasional things i want. \n\nI actually got my first job in November, at a little grocery store i really love going to. I was really excited and proud of myself and it made me feel awesome. However after working there for a few months, i was told a few days ago that they wouldn't be needing me anymore. Too many people working, too little demmand for service, needless to say i was laid off. So i went home and cried about it. [not ashamed of that, honestly, i loved the place] But what are you gonna do? Jobs are extremely hard to come by where i live, but i knew it was too good to be true, so i sort of saw it coming.\n\nI know how much of a jumbled mess this may seem like, but I'm at my wits end as to what to do. Therapy doesn't help me and i've seen some of the thing that have been posted and said here, so i feel like i may be able to get some better results here. When i'm not at school or with my friend, I just stay home, watch anime, play online games, and study foreign language, Japanese. I've been studying it for years and its pretty much the only thing in my life that helps me feel accomplished. I plan to do an exchange program in the college i transfer to and once done, try to teach English there [It's my best subject!] and make something of my life.\n\nHonestly reddit, i don't know what's wrong with me. In highschool it feels like all my emotions of depression and hatred for other people and myself have intensified by 100%. I thought graduating would make it better, but now that i'm in college now, i thought things would be different. Nope, still me, antisocial, lonely, frustrated, and a bunch of other 2 dollar words. It almost gets to the point to where i just want to kill myself. Don't get me wrong, i'd never hurt myself or anyone else, it's just that if i were to die tomorrow or even right now, i honestly think i wouldn't care. I like going to the shooting range to vent my anger and depression on the paper targets there. It helps a lot, but talking about it right now seems to be helping even more. All my life i went with never telling anyone how i feel, because, why should they care? I'm not them, and they are not me, so why should i give them my burden? But seeing as it's come to this, i don't see any other option. And you guys on Reddit seem really understanding.\n\nI guess i should also add that my girlfriend of 3 months just broke up with me a while ago after finding out that i wanted to go halfway around the world to study. After that i just felt like giving up. I went over to my friends house to drown my sorrows in vodka and sake, however i just ended up throwing up on his floor then passing out in his bed. [He really takes good care of me though and i'm grateful to have a friend like that] But i really loved her though and i'm sure she felt the same way, but i guess it was too much for her...I've never had  REAL relationship, i mean, i really don't think i'm that bad looking really...I'm 5'5, 145 lbs and i try to look as nice as i can....it's just that i don't have anymore strength or courage to continue. I'm still a virgin and every time i think about it, it makes me feel like I've somehow failed in life, as if I've done something wrong. I don't know why, the more i try to understand it, the more it doesn't make sense. I really feel like i need companionship though..I'm just way too lonely for words to speak. But with my tastes and interests, there's just no way i think ill ever find someone suitable. Honestly, how many girls are into the following things, anime, guns, tanks, Japanese culture, playing video games, history, and going to anime conventions? Sure some may enjoy those things, but i feel that its a slim minority, and counting they're not dating or anything. Who wants a boyfriend who talks about the battle of Kursk, or the Tiger tank's powerful 88mm gun? Who wants to listen to me talk about my vast collection of anime figurines and video games? And i honestly don't think the knowledge of the Japanese language would make me any more attractive.\n\nLike a lot of other people on this subreddit have said, \"I'm tired of watching life from the side lines.\" My young adult life is going to be over before i know it and i pretty much feel like i have nothing to show for it. Well, maybe my loneliness, but that's nothing to feel proud about. I mean, i don't know what to do reddit...about everything, I'm really hesitant on hitting that submit button right now...I hope i didn't manage to screw this post up like everything else I've done in life. I'm just alone in my house right now, my brother is with his friends, my parents at a party, and where am i? Sitting in a chair illuminated by the glow of the computer screen pouring out my feelings of the past 5 years. There's a lot more to the story, but i'm not writing a book here, just giving the important things i guess...They say we're all the star of our own story, some star i tuned out to be...thanks for listening.","media":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1441977973,"num_comments":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_1u4u5j","id":"1u4u5j","archived":true,"from":null,"author":"[deleted]","is_self":true,"from_id":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1u4u5j/my_distressed_life_as_a_hikikomori_something_that/","created":1388542143,"subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","from_kind":null,"stickied":false,"edited":false,"score":1,"quarantine":false}

I don't particularly want to be a reality TV star, personally. But I wouldn't discount the possibility that this particular program doesn't want to send their best science people out on round one for any number of reasons which I can't begin to imagine, and frankly sitting here contriving conspiracy theories about their motives really doesn't make me happy so I don't want to do it. I'm not going to go any further into this program without a much deeper understanding than I have right now, but in general I find it helpful to try to adopt a positive outlook and assess from that standpoint, rather than run into the analysis waving my skeptical flag.\n[When this whole thing blows up as the marketing scam of a bad reality TV idea, will you go hide in a cave, or come back to Reddit telling us how you knew it was never going to work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1u478d/iama_one_of_the_1058_applicants_selected_for/ceecwuo?context=5)|Is there a third option?

(All right that might be a slight exaggeration, honestly this email didn't change my life much.)

Reddit's opinions don't represent an accurate cross-section of \"the public\" in general. Also, the dissenters tend to yell the loudest. There may be a silent majority who just aren't pissed off about anything so they're not speaking up. I have no idea.

In terms of personality traits, I would want the same thing the people running the selection process seem to be focused on: emotional fortitude, creative problem solving skills, and a sense of humor- that last being, in my view, the most crucial component to a small group of people surviving (literally) unimaginable circumstances together. In terms of passing the time, I don't know if you mean passing time between now and 2023, or once we actually get to Mars, but either way the answer is a big unknown right now.\n[What do you plan on saying when you first step foot on Mars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1u478d/iama_one_of_the_1058_applicants_selected_for/ceeg7cv?context=5)|I don't have any big plans for this.

I can't imagine sending anyone (aside from maybe a few to document the project\\) who are not skilled in some kind of technology, science, or survival techniques.  Seems like a waste of a seat.  That being said, what's your skill that would be an asset to the mission?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1u478d/iama_one_of_the_1058_applicants_selected_for/ceedfyx?context=5)|Actually, the listed [qualifications](http://www.mars-one.com/faq/selection-and-preparation-of-the-astronauts/what-are-the-qualifications-to-apply) are mostly personality traits, psychological and physical strengths, that sort of thing. I think their reasoning is that if you're intelligent, resilient, adaptable, etc. and have a good sense of humor, you can learn engineering etc. More important that you have the right mindset and can get along with the others.\n[Given that everyone on the mission would have a respective role to play, what do you think you would most positively contribute to the mission and why?

To an extent, everyone would have a role to play, but I get the feeling they're looking for several jack-of-all-trades types. The group needs to still function even if one, or several, or all but one of its members dies. I'm definitely a jack-of-all-trades type myself, and outside of sporting a decently varied set of survival skills, I would argue that a sense of humor is probably the most important thing. I'm not, like, setting out to build the first car on Mars or something. I don't have anything that specific in mind. Just keeping the group together, happy, productive, and as buffered as possible against the perils of being separated from everything they knew and loved before, would be a success. I have no idea why I got to the second round. I'm not medical personnel. They must have liked my stupid jokes.\n[What do you think about the very real possibility that you could die on Mars after only a short time due to some unexpected problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1u478d/iama_one_of_the_1058_applicants_selected_for/ceeev1i?context=5)|I'd rather die on Mars having lived a life no human ever has before, than live to 80 on Earth and regret saying no to the ultimate adventure.\n |That said, I still haven't 100% decided to pursue this Mars One thing further right now.

Once I actually started considering the Mars One mission as a real possibility, I had to start confronting the vast list of things I'd have to sacrifice to make it happen. If I were going to live out my life as a middle class American citizen, the lack of things like ever having a gourmet meal again might sting. When you start to assemble a list that includes that along with things like taking a walk in the fresh air without a spacesuit, ever seeing the people you've known and loved again, etc. the individual items meld into an abstraction which is easier to process than the loss of so many big and meaningful things. I'm nowhere near done processing it all.\n[Also. No more taxes. No more worry about finding a job or affording rent. No more obligation to go to relatives for holiday parties. No more grocery shopping. Somethings won't be so bad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1u478d/iama_one_of_the_1058_applicants_selected_for/ceekw5e?context=5)|That's the spirit.\n[What do you imagine that your daily life on Mars will be like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1u478d/iama_one_of_the_1058_applicants_selected_for/ceecr38?context=5)|Daily life on Mars, I can't even begin to imagine. Obviously in the initial stages it would be all about building sustainable habitats, but assuming the best circumstances (everyone survives and we have time to kill), I guess we'd focus more efforts on building things for the settlers to come.

For some reason, the simplicity of my reasoning tends to astound people. There's no way to say \"I want to go to Mars\" that doesn't make you sound crazy or suicidal, apparently. For me, it's more like, do I want to risk my life just to risk it? No. Would I be willing to do it for something worthy enough? Absolutely.\n[Do you feel a personal responsibility to create/do something on Mars that will set you apart from the others? If so, what are these visions.

I don't feel the need to set myself apart from the others. In fact, the level of publicity that seeing this through to the end would inevitably entail is terrifying. I'm just more concerned with contributing to something I care about as deeply as supporting the search for options re: the continuation of human civilization post-Earth, than I am with my own personal comfort. I am sure that my visions of what life there will be like will change drastically as the mission approaches, partly because more information will be available about how we will necessarily have to spend our time, and partly because I hadn't seen these as \"real\" thoughts to explore before, so I haven't had time to dig deep, sleep on it, see what emerges. \"What do you want to do with your life [on Earth]?\" is a MUCH different question from \"What do you want to do with your life [on Mars]?\"\n |If I could do one thing after arriving on Mars, it would be...

That might sound counterintuitive, but I'm offering this as my personal opinion, not arguing it as fact. My idealistic hopes and my actual suspicions about how the project will go are widely divergent. I don't think we're anywhere near ready to actually start populating Mars. Also, even if we were, there are other planets more conducive to sustaining human life that we just can't reach yet.

Why tackle the project with reality-tv/a scam?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1u478d/iama_one_of_the_1058_applicants_selected_for/ceejlio?context=5)|Good question. Largely because I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up. I'm 27, graduated with my bachelor's in 2008 and have had a myriad of bullshit jobs since then- a few just to pass time, a few to discount potential career paths as viable, a few that I wanted to work out that just didn't for one reason or another. As much as I might be willing to give it all up to go help pioneer human civilization on other planets, it was never my sole dream. I think I could be satisfied with a number of different life paths, and recently I've been more focused on the ones that will render a comfortable upper middle class existence here on Earth. I just never wanted to be an astrophysicist, it never crossed my mind to try to get work in a different part of NASA or other related agencies mostly because it's hard to get into government work if you don't have special skills they want or know someone on the inside, and I have neither credential at present. When I applied for Mars One, I had been aware for a couple of months that something like this was happening, and had been churning it over in the back of my mind, more as a thought question for myself than actually doing hard research on the program itself. When I discovered when the application deadline was, it was very close to the line, and I just decided to put in an application just in case and do the hard research afterwards- it would be easy to back out at that point, and I guess I saw the application fee as my penance for not paying closer attention to the deadline. I did not know at that time that reality TV had anything to do with it.\n[I'd like the 1st person on mars to be an individual who dedicated their life to the progression of science and exploration, not the next Space kardashian.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1u478d/iama_one_of_the_1058_applicants_selected_for/ceejlio?context=5)|First of all, \"space Kardashian\" needs to be a thing we all say now. Secondly, I'm curious what significance the first person on Mars has for you. I have really never understood most people's concern with ceremony, so your reasoning for this desire is seriously unclear to me (not trolling). Also, would it bother you if the first person on Mars got there via a for-profit, private mission instead of NASA?\n[Ohhh, fellow Philadelphian. Round two of Mars One aye?

I would be willing to sacrifice a hell of a lot to be a part of something so amazing, but I'm not really sure where my line is, personally, never having had the opportunity to test myself in any way remotely approaching this before.

Physically, probably 6 or 7 out of 10 right now, but that's a matter of habits that are relatively easily changed.

I've looked into jobs and careers where I could replace myself on every level after working hard for a few years, leave a self-maintaining system to generate enough income to live on and then go live frugally out in the world somewhere instead of working full-time. Right now, I had been considering going to back to school and taking some basic econ/finance/accounting courses, trying to re-orient myself in the job market a bit... looking into real estate options because managing your own team at a place like Keller Williams offers a decent amount of opportunity for doing what I described above... also have more than half a mind to just save up enough to move to South America for awhile and just wing it.

I'd like some advice and perspective about my situation, I was offered a high paying salary at a position that is comfortable with clear career progression (I'll call this path #1). I was also accepted into a graduate program for CS with several fellowships and research assistantships (I'll call this path #2). \n\nFor my career in path#1 my plans would be to work 4-5 years &amp; then pursue an MBA from a top 15 school. \n\nFor my career in path#2 my plans would be to work 3-4 years &amp; then pursue a PhD (I already worked 2 years).\n\nFinancially I have been matching my employer's 401k match &amp; am opening up a Roth IRA (I plan to max it out). I saved a significant portion of my salary and bought a new car (my 200k+ mile one had enough). I've been overpaying my car payment every month. I took out a 72 month loan on it, but plan to pay it off completely in 3-4 years.\nI'm currently saving ~40% of my income every month, sometimes closer to 50%. \n\nIf I were to choose path#2 I would take a significant salary reduction &amp; would most likely need to make minimum payments to my car (but I have enough in the bank to do so). I'm guessimating that I would take 4-6 years to complete a PhD degree. Currently I'm 26, and if I were to enter into a PhD by 27 then I'd be done by the time I'm 31-33 (which is still quite young). \n\nPath#1 would be comfortable. I'd be able to make a nice salary and ideally would have good career progression with an MBA and work experience. The trade off is, I'd feel like every day I am wasting my intellect and could have done something much more meaningful than an MBA. I feel like I'm trying to 'convince' myself that an MBA from a top school is 'enough'. I feel like I'm not being challenged at work like I was in school, and I feel like I'm becoming dumber everyday (even though I work in a very technically challenging &amp; analytical field).\n\nPath#2: I'd lose close to $500,000 in wages and would be living off a graduate students stipend. I'd probably be highly stressed &amp; would have to look for a job in an uncertain market once I graduated. I'm not interested in teaching, but only research. Applying for a research position in industry would be challenging &amp; there are no guarantees I'd find a good job anywhere. I could potentially make less with a PhD than I would with an MBA. I'd have to start over with a PhD &amp; move out of state away from all family/friends.\n\nI can't be the only person that has had to make such decisions. I'm wondering if anyone else can give me some wisdom or guidance on this both from a financial perspective and from a career perspective.\n\nIdeally one day I'd like to have a house/start a family. \n\n","media":null,"ups":43,"retrieved_on":1441977968,"num_comments":49,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"name":"t3_1u4uin","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"id":"1u4uin","from":null,"author":"[deleted]","is_self":true,"from_id":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1u4uin/in_a_dilemma_i_have_a_choice_between_a_high/","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","created":1388542460,"from_kind":null,"stickied":false,"score":43,"edited":false,"quarantine":false}

Sorry in advance for any grammar mistakes or bad spelling. \n\nMy father used to go diving when I was a kid. So we went often to Egypt because you have a lot of good reefs and wrecks. We often went to diving holidays and I used to spent the days with my dad on the boat where he had about 2 dives a day. \n\nOn one day we went out to some reef, I don't remember what reef it was. My dad went down with all of his diving mates as usual. The crew and myself used to stay on the boat. Normally the crew tried to fish or we played some music to waste some time. But this day was different. I don't know why but I remember that I immediately thought that something was different when my dad went down. I jumped into the water because I didn't wanted him to go. But my dad was gone and I needed to go back on the boat. \n\nTo this day I think I'm responsible for what has happened because of my bodies reaction. What do I mean with that? Well, you have to imagine I'm eight years old and I'm in fairly warm water. when I went on the boat I remember that I was fully erect and I don't know why. I know that I was because I think that triggered what followed but I don't know why. I didn't thought about women or anything, I just went out of the water and had a hard on. i didn't thought that it was something to be ashamed off, so I just went onto the ship.\n\nThe first thing I remember is the face of one of the people of the crew. He had a big grin on his face and with his hand he pointed to his pants. He had a huge erection and I was terrified. So he didn't spoke any German or English and I didn't knew any arab words, he just pointed to his penis and clearly wanted me to sit down. I just shook my head and tried to get away. But that wasn't possible because he just grabbed me by the arm. He ripped my bathing shorts down and pulled me onto his penis. To this day this is the biggest pain I ever felt in my life. My heart broke, my soul everything, my childhood, my relationship to every person I'll ever know went down the drain. I don't remember the whole incident as I guess my brain just shut off, but I remember every consequence the incident had for me. There are only 2 persons in the world who know about this, one of them is my partner. But I never described what happened exactly because I was never able to do it. \n\nEven now I can't describe what happened in the maybe 3-5 minutes. I only know that it broke me. Sure I'm able to live my life, but it destroyed so much for me that I would kill that person instantly if I was able to. I feel so much hatred and anger to that person, I can't describe it. He destroyed everything what could have been. 22 years later and I still can't think about it but I need to. I really don't know how to cope as there are phases that are totally fine and than, suddenly, it hits you like a jackhammer and you don't know where you even are. You act like an asshole because you're angry at the world but you don't want to hurt people that you love. I didn't had a relationship to my father, who always was my hero, for a majority of my teenage years because I couldn't look him into the eyes. Not because I couldn't have told him, not because he wouldn't have understood but because of shame. Even remotely think about telling him makes me want to cry and puke at the same time. I know that I need therapy but I'm not able to get it because I'm afraid and because I don't want to talk about it- I can't imagine talking with someone about something which lies 20 years in the past. I don't want to go through my childhood and things I know. I know that I have issues and I know what would be the best way to treat them, but I'm not man enough to do it. I feel weak and defeated, but I can't surrender. I just live my life from day to day and try to not think about it which is fine for most of the days. But when it hits me, it hits me hard. Life can be a awful. \n\nI don't know what to expect from this post but I just literally just need it off my chest. Thanks for reading.

I am 16. My problem is that my brother is completely vicious to my sister and nobody will do anything to stop my brother from not only physically hurting her, but emotionally for destroying her. For example, my sister will come home from school with some craft that they did(maybe a Christmas decoration). She will announce \"Look at the craft I did at school!\" Everyone will say like \"That's cool\" or something while my brother will laugh and say that it is horrible. My mom will just look at my brother and make eye contact for a second then say nothing. My brother will even go as far as breaking what my sister made and is proud of. My stepfather will just say \"don't be like that\". Another example; at a restaurant, just the family and my brother just wont stop kicking my sister under the table. My sister will complain to my mother about it, my mother will tell my stepfather to do something then he will just say \"stop\". Honestly, I bet he says stop over 80 time total when we are somewhere out together. I want to cry for my sister, she is so nice and innocent. She wouldn't hurt a fly. I can't live in this house. I can't live with my sister being constantly put down by my vicious brother. We were at my cousins hockey game the other day and my sister had a rash on her face that she was embarrassed about and my brother kept bringing it up, kept reminding her. Eventually my mother and my sister left. It was just me, my brother, my stepfather, and my uncle. Stepfather was talking to my uncle about my sister saying things like \"Shes a very good skater\" and \"shes very tall for her age\" and after everything my stepfather would say my brother would have to disagree or say \"no shes not\" or \"but im better\" \"or I was better\". Like he always needs to push my sister down. And it's clear that my brother is my stepfathers favorite, I don't care but I don't understand how they can be blind to the viciousness of my brother. It's like they don't even try to stop him anymore. He's got them rapped around his finger, they have like given up or something. I don't know what to do. I'm afraid that he is going to mess her up permanently or something. Please help, anything I can do. Anything I can tell my parents, or my brother, or even my sister.

On the outside, I appear to have my shit together.  I've got nice things, a good job, good-looking, in decent shape, etc.  I drank heavily through high school and college and then also in my 20s. I used to work for a pretty big company with a lot of people that had a \"work hard / play hard\" atmosphere and we had our fair share of drunken fun.  I quit that job 3 years ago and moved \"home\" after being away for 8 years.  The only people I really know here are people I went to high school with and grew up with.  They are also some of my biggest drinking buddies, but they have somehow managed to move on with their life and get married, start families, etc, etc.  I haven't done any of that and it keeps me up at night.  \n\nI have never really had any real bad moments (well, maybe a few) as a result of my drinking, but looking back on it, I've just wasted many years of my life doing something I don't enjoy.  Over the last 1-2 years, I have seriously cut back on my drinking.  On an average month, I'll go out to bars a few times a month and drink 2-3 beers and head home.  It isn't enough to really get a buzz but only to make me tired and bloated.  Then, about once a month I'll hang out with these old friends and binge drink pretty bad.  I don't even enjoy it, but it is like it is expected behavior and it is what they do as their main \"hobby\".  This is really sad, but this is the extent of my social life.  I do not know how to meet people in real life, and as sad as this sounds when I am drinking I really am not even interested in \"hollering\" at the women that are around me because I hate drinking and am kind of disgusted by it.\n\nTonight, I am sitting at home cruising reddit and watching TV.  I would much rather be doing this than out drinking, but I would also much rather not be spending the night alone.  I could go out and drink and have \"temporary\" friends for awhile, but I don't want to do that.  \n\nWhen you are 32, it is just hard to meet people.  I work for a small company and all of my co-workers are much older than me.  I get along with them, but I am not going to be able to broaden my social horizons much with them (and they all drink like fish anyways). \n\nA prime example of what I am trying to say is what last Sunday consisted of for me.  I went to an NFL football game.  The kickoff was at 1 pm.  We started tailgating at 9 am, got pretty liquored up before the game, went in, drank a little bit more, left the game at 4 pm.  My friends all have kids and families; they went home.  I was kinda buzzed and wanted to keep it going, so I went to a local bar and drank a couple more beers.  I had some interesting conversations, then I went home at 8 pm and passed out in my bed.  I didn't get arrested, didn't black out, didn't call up an ex-girlfriend, didn't get in a fight, wasn't very hungover the next day, but I feel like I should be doing something more constructive with my time.  I have had time off from work for the past 2 weeks and haven't really much to show for my time.  With the exception of the NFL game on Sunday, I haven't been boozing it up the whole time, but I also haven't done much of anything else.\n\nI know I have been rambling, but it is very hard to explain what I am trying to say.  I think it is best summarized by saying, \"I don't have anything exciting going on in my life, so I drink out of boredom but I don't even enjoy doing that\".  \n\nSo, what do you guys think ?  I've been lurking here for awhile and I am very inspired by a lot of you who seem to have been worse drunks than me.  Thanks for reading.  \n\nAlso, I'm in Atlanta if anyone else is from here and wants to show me how to have sober fun.  \n","media":null,"ups":7,"retrieved_on":1441977891,"created_utc":"1388548412","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"stopdrinking","domain":"self.stopdrinking","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"I have no social life.","secure_media_embed":{}}

I am 16. My problem is that my brother is completely vicious to my sister and nobody will do anything to stop my brother from not only physically hurting her, but emotionally for destroying her. For example, my sister will come home from school with some craft that they did(maybe a Christmas decoration). She will announce \"Look at the craft I did at school!\" Everyone will say like \"That's cool\" or something while my brother will laugh and say that it is horrible. My mom will just look at my brother and make eye contact for a second then say nothing. My brother will even go as far as breaking what my sister made and is proud of. My stepfather will just say \"don't be like that\". Another example; at a restaurant, just the family and my brother just wont stop kicking my sister under the table. My sister will complain to my mother about it, my mother will tell my stepfather to do something then he will just say \"stop\". Honestly, I bet he says stop over 80 time total when we are somewhere out together. I want to cry for my sister, she is so nice and innocent. She wouldn't hurt a fly. I can't live in this house. I can't live with my sister being constantly put down by my vicious brother. We were at my cousins hockey game the other day and my sister had a rash on her face that she was embarrassed about and my brother kept bringing it up, kept reminding her. Eventually my mother and my sister left. It was just me, my brother, my stepfather, and my uncle. Stepfather was talking to my uncle about my sister saying things like \"Shes a very good skater\" and \"shes very tall for her age\" and after everything my stepfather would say my brother would have to disagree or say \"no shes not\" or \"but im better\" \"or I was better\". Like he always needs to push my sister down. And it's clear that my brother is my stepfathers favorite, I don't care but I don't understand how they can be blind to the viciousness of my brother. It's like they don't even try to stop him anymore. He's got them rapped around his finger, they have like given up or something. I don't know what to do. I'm afraid that he is going to mess her up permanently or something. Please help, anything I can do. Anything I can tell my parents, or my brother, or even my sister.

I lost about 10 pounds (170-161) but when it got colder I lost motivation (wearing sweatshirts every day and not being able to go outside much let me get lazy) and gained it all back.\n\n\nObviously high school is fairly stressful to begin with, but I've noticed lately that my self-confidence is pretty low and I don't feel comfortable wearing anything other than a sweatshirt and jeans. I'll be a Junior next year and I really want to feel good in more flattering clothing. Being able to wear a normal bathing suit by this summer would also be amazing. I love swimming but usually end up sitting on the beach because I look terrible in my tankini thing.\n\n\nThe other big issue is that (obliviously) I live with my parents. Between them and my younger siblings, there is junk food ALL the time! Whenever I get stressed out or bored, it's difficult to resist over eating. It's also harder to get fresh fruits that aren't from ridiculously far away this time of year. How can I resist the junk food temptation? And what are some healthier, low calorie snacks I could try?\n\n  \nAny advice on how to stay motivated? What usually happen is I have a bad day or two, and never really get back on track. Also, any suggestions for exercises I can do inside? (I don't currently have access to a gym) My goal weight is 135-140 (I'm 5'9.5\") and I really want to achieve a healthy BMI after years of being chubby and so many failed attempts.\n\n\nSorry for the long post! Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and good luck to anyone else resolving to lose weight!\n\n\n\n[Update]: I gave all of my leftover Christmas candy to my sisters and drank ice water the few times today I was craving junk food. This might not seem like a lot but it's a big step for me.

She shares my sense of adventure and surpasses me in witty banter... She's back in Colorado now, my home state, and we broke up because she wants to be single before I move back. \n\n\nI'd be happy with waiting, but she doesn't want to. She said her life has been defined by guys her whole adult life and she needs to find herself. I want her to, because it's important, and I actually care about her in that I want her to be happy, and I want her to be the best person she can be.\n\n\nI know that distance relationships bog couples down. I don't want that. She wants to go on a date when I get back to see if we can still try this again. But she also isn't sure if she'll want to be single or not at that time.\n\n\nShe's 20, I'm 26. Maybe I'm too old fashioned. Maybe it's just normal that it hurts so much to let go. My relationship experience is pretty much that five year one and one very bad one when I was 16 that culminated in me finding her in a bathtub with her wrists cut. I loved my last one, but it wasn't working anymore. With this girl, there was never anything wrong. We got along so well. It was just the distance. But I don't really know how to deal with it. I can be her friend. I could claim not to be upset that she's probably going to date around more. I could easily meet other women too, I'm really open and not bad looking. It's just that I felt more for this girl than I ever felt for someone I loved for five years, like a real connection, and I couldn't think of it.

Reading all the success and failure stories here gave me true motivation to put some serious effort into it. \n      \n        Oddly enough, abstaining from M was fairly easy, especially with the help from reading all the stories. I didn't make a clear goal so I kept moving around from different lengths of days. Then while looking at a nofap motivation picture that depicted a year of nofap would consider you a Jedi Master, being a huge Star Wars fan from my childhood, I figured this would be the best goal to set and ultimately reach. \n\nI think a little background information on myself before we get started should help a bit. I am 17 years young, male, virgin, and currently in some sort of proper physical shape in my eyes. I was never a ladies man due to my lack of motivation to talk to them early on in life and that would do nothing but impair my ability to talk to them later on, and be awkward as fuck when I do get to talk to a girl.

But right when it comes to a cute female I lock up and go full \"Micheal Cera\". \n\n      One of the big pushers for me to do nofap was because I was hung over a past girlfriend and couldn't obtain one of two things with her. Either closure for why she would not get back with me(I originally broke it off but that's a story for another time.) or ultimately winning her back. This would put me into a downward spiral of constant shit. The final outcome was I NEEDED to get over her and move on once and for all. \n\n      After a  while I found a girl to shift interest toward. The only odd thing about her was she was 4 years older than me. For a high school student that's pretty weird. But being with her was very nice. Slow at first, but quickly sped up. No problem here because both of us were fine with it. Things were getting a bit frisky and I figured I didn't want to regret my \"first\" time with a girl. I put some serious thought about it with her and I felt comfortable going all the way. Well this is where shit in my little world hits the fan. Basically  I couldn't stay hard and that kicks a man's pride right in the dick. I couldn't figure out why, I was very into it and so was she. I thought this could be because of PIED or just nervousness and anxiety at work. All of them were probable causes but I brushed it off. Until it happens again the very next week. I then figured it was due to the constant M that desensitized my comrade downstairs. Mind you this relationship was around days 88 to about 118. \n\nThe relationship failed when she would constantly act depressed just to keep the attention on her. Even though all of my attention was already on her. Bad move on her part. \n\n          I felt a few urges to break because of feeling like complete shit but I remained vigilant and carried on. This is where I basically broke down to a bare being. My sexual desires dissipated. I wasn't attracted to anything at this point (days 134). I became a non-sexual seeking entity. Everything I did at point was only to advance my survival in this world. My life settled into a daily rut. This is the turning point of everything and it was what I believe to be the underlying reason of nofap. You go to your darkest to see the brightest. Once I came out of this I knew what I wanted, a real relationship. Not just some booty call. \n        \n      At this point my thought process was almost crystal clear. Looking for the girl. Not just the body. Some other effects I noticed was my ability and the strength of my self control. I rarely unleash on people anymore and I don't hurt myself when pissed off now. If anything this was fantastic to have acquired. My confidence to pursue girls multiplied immensely. I was now able to hold legitimate conversations with cute girls, maintain fluency, and even spark up the conversation on my own. All of this was phenomenal. The only thing keeping me down was the not being able to stay hard. It took a devastating mental toll on me. \n\n        While being single I ultimately dropped my worries about PIED and came to terms with it. Then out of nowhere the whore of my school wants to hang out with me (It may seem harsh putting it that way but she knows it and so does everybody else.) and I agree to it but I brought my closest friend with me as a safety net. He was well aware of his role that night. We all hang out, go to eat, then I decide its the nice thing to do to walk her home. Keep in mind she wouldn't stop dropping hints about her having sex that night. It was obvious she wanted the D. But I had no real intentions to give it. So we get to her house and watch a raunchy movie. Then as I am getting ready to haul ass home (it was 1 o'clock in the morning and I was in the shit of the ghetto), she instantly starts making out with me. All tongue, not even a starter kiss. As that continued clothes were beginning to come off and we go up stairs to her room. She tries putting me in her and I veto that instantly for two reasons. No condom and she was riding the crimson tide at the time.  \n\nWelp, she finds a condom, I'm just weirded out for the most part. I put it on, she gets on top, tries to get in, comes back up before I get in and there is blood on the tip of my wang. Lost all interest, got soft(not  because of the blood), and then she begins talking to my penis. Shit got weird, fast. I leave shortly after that. But from this I picked up its not really nervousness or anxiety for why I fail at it in bed. The condom just doesn't agree with me. And that's unfortunate because there is no way in hell I am having sex with anyone without a condom on. And I am perfectly fine with this situation. The time will come when shit actually does work for once. \n\nFast forward a few months to the end of summer and I meet a really sweet Ukrainian girl that my good friend hooked me up with. She came from an extremely strict family and a cult-like religious background. Her father was a Russian soldier during the Soviet Union days and now is a pastor for their church and to top it off he cheats on his wife(yep... For a man of god that makes sense). She had little contact with the outside world beside her family who either share the same strict ideals or completely ruined their lives with stupid decision because of the same strict living conditions. We made the relationship work for a bit, she would sneak out of her house whenever possible, which was very scarce and I hate texting so everything became very stale. She would also act like a therapist to everyone and she would always want to tell me about other peoples problem and not even discuss how our day was. A few pros to this while situation was texting meant sending pictures and we are two promiscuous teenager so I hope you can connect the dots on this one. But she would want to do this picture messaging at the weirdest times, like in school or when she was talking someone down from self harming. What put the last nail in the coffin on this failing relationship was the fact that she was put into a arranged marriage by her father. She didn't agree with this but she also didn't seem too upset over it. She said she was going to undermine the whole thing by acting like an ass to the other family. I believed her, but nothing would have saved the relationship from this train wreck. So I promptly ended it and she was somewhat ok with it. It was a clean break despite the situation. \n\nNow to Christmas eve, the most peculiar event happens, I had my first wet dream ever. For seventeen and a half year I never had one. But what made this even more odd is that it wasn't just one release, it was two. I think everything just went back to factory settings that morning. You could say it was a white Christmas, (no pun intended, well maybe a little). I stayed strong and fought the chaser effect. That was a challenge all onto itself.\n\n        Most importantly to realize about my situation is that sex shouldn't be goal orientated(Orgasm shouldn't be the goal) it should be pleasure orientated. And with that in mind everything can be great and an overall amazing experience. \n\n        Nofap is overall a great endeavor I intend to continue to partake in, some people try to convince me to break it because they believe that's why I can't stay up. Despite these suggestion I'm continuing the journey and search for some concrete answers to this all. I must say the random erections are less frequent since beginning this but when I do get hard, it's fucking steel. Morning wood? Nah, morning titanium. I usually fantasize about having a happy relationship with a girl than having physical intimacy. It's wonderful not thinking sex is the focal point of women existence. Now I do want to make this clear to everyone, I have a slight fear of the day I do release my special man juice. It's been over 350 days. I may literally shoot an eye out. But what ever the case may be it will be crazy and I hope it is with the right girl. Because there would be a better chance she would forgive me if she goes blind. \n\n      So my fellow fapstronaunts, one and all. I know you all know this but it's worth repeating, you are all revolutionaries of our time, this is the road less traveled not only because it is difficult, but also because this is where the men are sorted from the boys. And for those ladies out there, cudos. Your journey is just as significant as anyone's else. \n        \n        Just remember Whatever your end goal may be, wherever your motivation is, for whatever reason you are partaking in this great crusade for, make sure it is for the right reasons and to stay true to yourself and to never sell yourself short. Walk tall with your heads held high for we are giants. ","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/NoFap/comments/1u553z/nofap_2013_achievement_unlock_recap_the_journey/"}

{"media":null,"selftext":"Another year has gone by and I've gotten through it. Just like every year before it. I had so many plans, so many hopes, so many dreams, but in the end I was complacent and just coasted. \n\nI got by. \n\nI was supposed to move to Chicago last June. Or Seattle, Denver, Korea, New York. But what did I do? \n\nI took the easy road.\n\nI finished my B.A. sure, but as soon as that was done what did I do? I moved back into my Moms basement.\n\nBecause it was easier than moving, it was easier than staying where I was working my ass off 50+ hours a week for $8/hour to pay for a shitty apartment with shitty furniture and a shitty internet service. \n\nYou know what? Fuck Easy Mode.\n\nEasy mode has my fat ass sitting here at 0015 bitching to the internet.\n\nBut then again Easy Mode is easy. \n\nI'll get up and try to better myself for the next month. Then drop back into complacency. I won't look for a better job, I won't look for a girlfriend. \n\nHell I probably won't come into physical contact with another human being other than to shake hands. It's been at least 7 months since I last hugged someone who wasn't family and at least 5 months since hugging someone who was. I'm 24 years old and it's been nearly a decade since I last kissed a girl. Wow that's depressing. \n\nBut a girl replied to a tweet I sent her and was really nice and thanked me for thinking of her. It was the first kind thing someone said to me all year, so I got that going for me. One compliment, one ounce of gratitude, you have no idea how happy that one little 117 character tweet made me. I was so close to going a whole year without even a smidge of positive human interaction. \n\nLet's hope I make it a little farther this year before falling into complacency and taking the easy road. Or at least have someone to take the easy road with me.

I'm never at peace...relaxed, fuck I don't even remember how it feels to just be able to Be anymore!  I know how my life got here.   I do.  I simply don't know how to turn it around!   Finally, after 4 long years, I'm crumbling under the pressure.  \n\nI apologize to anyone that actually reads this.  I'm not even sure that I want it to be read.  This will be too long. I only know that I Have to get this shit out before it consumes me &amp; steals even more of my life.  \n\nSeptember 2008, we adopted my daughter's best friend.  She claimed her adoptive parents were horrible-they claimed it was her that was horrible-but for me, I only saw a child who needed love.   My husband was vehemently against it, yet upon my begging, he finally relented with the warning of he foresaw trouble ahead. How right he was.  \n\nWe gave this child everything!  We moved our 4 year old son into our room so she could have her own.  Put her into a private school.  Bought her an entire new wardrobe.  Bought her a $700 cell phone, $600 laptop, $800 flat screen tv for her room, &amp; had her room redecorated the way she wanted.  To us?  She was ours. She claimed to feel the same way.   \n\nDisciplining her was always difficult.  The first problem was her grades.  All F's.  No homecoming unless she got them up to C's, even though we'd already spent $680 on her dress. It felt horrible to do this to her during her senior year of highschool, &amp; the first dance she'd ever been allowed to go to!  We let her go when she made D's.   Next was the lying over stupid things.  Then for some reason she could Never let anyone have a good birthday Except for her or myself. Everyone else's she'd do something to ruin the day.  Next was driving 3 hours to buy her a $900 prom dress, only to then go to Walmart &amp; have them stop us as we were walking out the store because she's stolen $20 worth of makeup!  Then was the sneaking out to see an abusive girlfriend that we'd forbidden her to date.  That was the final straw for me.  \n\nMy daughter ratted her out for sneaking out of the house &amp; having this girl sneak into our house at night.  I took her cell phone away permanently, &amp; sold the prom dress.  I then made the biggest mistake of my life.  I didn't trust that lying wretched piece of crap to be left home without my husband or I, so I made her go to the grocery store with me, but I allowed my 14 year old daughter to stay home.  I told her why she had to come along....\"You can't be trusted anymore\".  \n\nWe were shopping for 2 hours. She said she had to use the bathroom while I was checking out, when she returned....she just seemed, I don't know, nervous, worried, anxious. Not right. \n\nWhen I stepped into the foyer, I saw a bloody hand print going down my wall, puddles &amp; trails of blood. I screamed my daughter's name, dropped the groceries, &amp; ran room to room searching for her. After 20 minutes I found her beaten to hell, curled up in the corner of my closet.  For the rest of my life. I will not ever be able to remove that image, nor the sounds she was making, from my memory.  I thought she'd only been beaten!!!  I'll never understand how I could've possibly been so incredibly stupid!\n\nI ran to the foyer to get my phone to call 911, &amp; that's when it hit me that this other one hadn't been by my side searching for her \"sister\"!  She was sitting at the table eating a bowl of cereal!!!!  I remember standing there looking at the trails &amp; puddles of blood, &amp; then back at her eating cereal, &amp; asking myself \"Have I taught my children all they need to know?  Can my husband stay sober &amp; raise them on his own?  Will they be able to hug me in prison?  Will I go to hell if I kill her?  She has to die. This isn't right!  She should be upset!  Crying!  Not eating a fucking bowl of god damn cereal!!  What does she have to do with this?\".    I stepped into the kitchen &amp; told her if she ate one more bite she'd lose every tooth in her mouth, asked her if she was at all concerned about where her sister was, &amp; exactly what the hell she knew about this.  Her answer?  \"I'm hungry.  What?  Did she rat on somebody else so now they can't have they phone &amp; be with they girlfriend either?\"\n\nWhen I called 911, the dispatcher asked me if my daughter had been sexually assaulted.  That's when I broke down. That's when everything in my brain clicked. When the officers asked her who'd done this to her?  \"My sister's girlfriend's older brother. He said I better learn to keep my mouth shut, stay out of their relationship, stop acting like I was better than them, &amp; to tell my momma that karma's a bitch\".  When the cops interviewed the other one, she lied &amp; said she didn't know where her girlfriend lived, what her girlfriend &amp; her brother's last name were, &amp; that she hadn't talked to or seen them in over 2 months.  They seized her cell phone right then &amp; explained to my husband, myself, &amp; her that smart phones were like computers...even if you deleted the text or email, they could still pull it from the phone.  \n\nI spent 11 hours in the ER that night getting a rape exam done on my daughter.  A condom wasn't used, so she had to be tested &amp; treated for std's. We were notified 5 days later that she in fact had 3 std's.  She was a virgin when this happened.  Had the plans to wait for everything, including even kissing until the day she married.  The attack on her was so severe that she received 13 anal stitches, 25 vaginal stitches, 8 stitches to her left breast from a bite wound, &amp; a total of 31 facial stitches.   \n\nThree days later I got both girls, myself, &amp; my husband into rape crisis counseling.  That night the brother was arrested, charged as an adult with 8 felonies, &amp; 6 misdemeanors. His bail, cash only, was set at $125,000. He posted bail within an hour.  \n\nThe morning of the first trial date came.  We were all in the courtroom &amp; the piece of shit filed a motion to fire his public defender on the grounds that his attorney was ineffectively representing him.  The motion was denied, however it won him another delay in the trial.  The trial was delayed SEVEN times!!  That's 7 times of my daughter &amp; I going through emotional hell.  \"Oh god I hope it goes through this time.  Please just let us get this over with so we can move on. Oh dear god I don't want to do this crap!  WHY did I ever wish this would go to trial?!  Ok get control of yourself!!!  Come on, you're strong!  Set an example!  We can do this!....WHY DO THEY KEEP CANCELING THIS FUCKING TRIAL?!!  DO THEY NOT CARE THAT WE CANNOT LIVE UNTIL THIS IS OVER &amp; DONE WITH?!\"\n\nNovember 5th 2013, the prosecutor called me to come to her office with my legal advocate &amp; counselor.  When I got there she handed me a binder of printed out pages at least an inch thick.  It was all of the emails, texts, screen shots of videos, &amp; photos they'd gotten off of the other one's phone, instagram, &amp; facebook.  She was giving me the courtesy of letting me know that they were charging her with an accessory to the 8 felony counts of sexual assault. She'd worked with her girlfriend &amp; the brother &amp; set all of it up!!  She even went so far as to call him from the grocery store when I was checking out to tell him we were on the way home.   She cracks jokes in text to the guy about \"the bitch thinks I can't be trusted now.  CTFU!  She don't even kno!  Stoopid mf!\". &amp; \"she always be talking bout making sure u putting out good karma.  Yea mhmm karma finna be a bitch huh ma\".  I puked in the trashcan.  I knew for 3 years that she had something to do with it, yet every single time I asked, she lied straight to my face!!\n\nI tried reaching my husband &amp; couldn't.  He &amp; I separated a year &amp; a half ago.   The way he chose to handle this is to start drinking again, &amp; quickly lose control of it.   That left me with no choice but to have my daughter take my son to the park so that he wasn't at the house to see his \"sister\", whom he worshipped &amp; adored, placed under arrest.  \n\nWe finally, after all these years, had the trial.   December 9th through 11:56 a.m. December 13th. Friday the 13th. The prosecutor never once called my daughter in to talk to her in the past 3 years, or even that day, to prepare her, give her sample questions, go over her testimony, nothing.  None of the officers, doctors, or nurses were talked to.  Nothing!  Hell I'm 39 years old &amp; I was scared to death!  My husband, her father,  was subpoenaed for December 10th &amp; was passed out drunk &amp; didn't show up.   The brother refused to take the stand in his own defense.   In closing arguments His attorney said \"my client concedes to the misdemeanor counts of sex acts with a juvenile &amp; aggravated assault &amp; battery.  I implore you to find him guilty of these counts, not the felony sex assault counts\". His OWN freaking attorney admitted guilt to some of the charges!!!\n\nYet at 12:23p.m. the jury came back with a verdict of not guilty on all counts.  They gave my baby 27 fucking minutes!!!  They had DNA evidence.   6 different bite impressions that matched his teeth to a degree of 99.998%. The severity of damage done to her body.  Photographs.  HER dna on our tv remote control, our broom handle, &amp; our toilet brush!!!  HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?!  Here's the thing, its Not a jury of His peers.  No!  Its a jury of her peers.  My peers.  They failed my baby just as much as I did &amp; it is terrorizing her!\n\nOn Christmas Eve night I woke up to a loud noise.  It was her passing out in the bathroom.  She'd taken an entire bottle of her prescribed sleeping medication in a suicide attempt.  She's been in an inpatient treatment facility two hours away since then.  That's been ok because I've been able to take her brother to see her every day until yesterday.  I went to start my car &amp; my battery was dead.   Next logical step was to try to jump start it.    After 30 minutes &amp; it still didn't work, he &amp; I walked 2 miles &amp; I paid $137 for a new battery with higher cold cranking amps since everyone said that's what I needed.   Put that one in?   STILL doesn't start!  Called &amp; let my mechanic listen to it today....its the starter.   So now I'm looking at another $320 after having just wasted $137.   I don't have that freaking luxury anymore damn it!  Its just me &amp; my two babies.  I'm trying so Very freaking hard, &amp; it truly feels like every time I turn around I'm getting sucker punched.  \n\nI just want life to go back to the way that it used to be before I was foolish enough to bring a girl with borderline personality disorder-a sociopath (seeing as that's what her attorney &amp; dr have filed with the court as to why she's not competent to stand trial) into our family!  I did this to my babies &amp; I feel like no matter what....they'll both always suffer for my incredibly stupid choice!  I don't know what to do anymore.  I only wish they both knew how deeply sorry I am for failing them so severely!  My god my heart is broken.  I miss my daughter terribly!  Nothing is as it should be anymore &amp; for the life of me...I don't know how to fix it. \n\nTL;DR:  Life after rape, betrayal, &amp; a failed justice system will never be ok again. I've failed as a parent. Severely failed.

(I also went to my doctor to ensure I don't have any other illness- and sure enough I don't).\nThe worst withdrawal symptom is undoubtedly the anxiety. You know that feeling you get when your heart skips a beat, but is then immediately resolved just a moment later? Imagine that 'upbeat' when your heart skips the beat, but now let that anxious 'heart-skips-a-beat' feeling continually ride on, for hours and hours.\nThe next withdrawal symptom that is extremely difficult to deal with is the sensitive stomach/nausea/lack of apatite. I'm 30 years old, over 6 feet tall and over 200 pounds, but I have barely eaten anything these past 2 days. Yesterday I threw up twice. I have no desire to eat.\nAnother withdrawal symptom is a sudden shift in body temperature- sweat hot bullets one second, shivering cold the next. Specifically, my palms are very sweaty- I can actually make them drip sweat when I clutch my fist. I am naturally a little more sweaty than most people, but quitting has made it 20x worse.\nAlso, I have been coughing up a ridiculous amount of black gunk, especially in the shower after breathing in the warm mist for a couple of minutes.\nMy head is swimming and cloudy and I simply feel ill. I think back to the years of toking, and all those filthy bongs that get loaded with resin. Sure, you can rinse a bong or bubbler out with salt and alcohol to clean it- but after years and years of habitual use, that resin has built up inside of me. In fact, I got a chest X-ray and doctors were shocked to see my 'dirty lungs'. It looked like spiderwebs have been blasted all through out my lungs.\nI wanted to share my experience. Sure, smoking some weed here or there is innocent enough, but once marijuana use turns into daily habitual use, multiple times a day, year after year, it is no longer so innocent.\nI know most people here are marijuana enthusiasts, and trust me, I get it. Even now I love the smell of it, the feel of it, the way it looks, the love and care that can go into growing such a beautiful plant. But the lesson here is that moderation is key.\nMy mind and body are so unstable right now from these withdrawal symptoms that I know I will never toke again. I can't gamble feeling this way ever again. I'm quite literally bed-ridden. I've officially smoked myself out. Too far out.\nHas anyone else experienced any withdrawal symptoms like this? Anything to ease to the pain (yes, pain. I am in pain, psychological and physical)?\nIf anyone reading this feels like they're loosing his/her footing on the slippery slope of marijuana addiction and has the need to smoke multiple times a day, I urge you to cut back or stop sooner than later. I'm afraid I've done 14 years of damage to my body, and I feel foolish, wreckless and careless for doing so.\nI understand that marijuana enthusiasts will down vote this post. Hell, I probably would have a year ago thinking \"Mariujana addiction? Marijuana withdrawal? Man up you fucking pussy.\" But here I am, struggling and in pain. Regretful that I ever blackened my lungs.\nIn closing, I also find it disheartening how marijuana use has become so widely accepted and 'cool' over the past several decades in American culture. Cheech and Chong, Half Baked, Pineapple Express, This is the End. These are all movies that glorify the use of marijuana. Who wouldn't wanna blaze a fatty with James Franco and Seth Rogan? They're so damn cool. I also remember Bob Saget's hilarious line from Half Baked, \"You ever suck dick for weed?\" And I think that's exactly the problem- Ameican culture regards smoking pot as a harmless activity. How many people get high and then go drive on the wrong side of the freeway, or how many stoners have gone home and beat their significant other? Not many, if any at all. And that's the problem- marijuana is regarded (even by A-List celebrities) as being harmless and cool. And like I said, moderation is key. But once the addiction grabs hold and you find yourself smoking multiple times a day, year after year, I fear you might end up in a dark place, similar to how I have found myself.\n**TL;DR- years of daily habitual marijuana use has seriously fucked with my mind and body**","domain":"self.leaves","hide_score":false,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"leaves","created_utc":"1388554355","author_flair_text":null,"title":"My terrible Marijuana withdrawal","secure_media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"default","stickied":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1u55ym/my_terrible_marijuana_withdrawal/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s9i3","created":1388554355,"from_kind":null,"from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"score":1,"edited":false,"id":"1u55ym","archived":true,"link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_1u55ym","saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":0,"is_self":true,"author":"[deleted]","from":null}

I joined in and only stayed on the train for 15 days then PMOed. I never tried nofap again until the year 2013 rolled around and the same friend informs me about this place called reddit and the help forum it contains. Reading all the success and failure stories here gave me true motivation to put some serious effort into it. \n      \nOddly enough, abstaining from M was fairly easy, especially with the help from reading all the stories. I didn't make a clear goal so I kept moving around from different lengths of days. Then while looking at a nofap motivation picture that depicted a year of nofap would consider you a Jedi Master, being a huge Star Wars fan from my childhood, I figured this would be the best goal to set and ultimately reach. \n\nI think a little background information on myself before we get started should help a bit. I am 17 years young, male, virgin, and currently in some sort of proper physical shape in my eyes. I was never a ladies man due to my lack of motivation to talk to them early on in life and that would do nothing but impair my ability to talk to them later on, and be awkward as fuck when I do get to talk to a girl. I am semi outgoing because of being in the Scouts for practically my entire life, so I can talk to just about any stranger on the street and have a compelling conversation with them. But right when it comes to a cute female I lock up and go full \"Micheal Cera\". \n\nOne of the big pushers for me to do nofap was because I was hung over a past girlfriend and couldn't obtain one of two things with her. Either closure for why she would not get back with me(I originally broke it off but that's a story for another time.) or ultimately winning her back. This would put me into a downward spiral of constant shit. The final outcome was I NEEDED to get over her and move on once and for all. \n\nAfter a  while I found a girl to shift interest toward. The only odd thing about her was she was 4 years older than me. For a high school student that's pretty weird. But being with her was very nice. Slow at first, but quickly sped up. No problem here because both of us were fine with it. Things were getting a bit frisky and I figured I didn't want to regret my \"first\" time with a girl. I put some serious thought about it with her and I felt comfortable going all the way. Well this is where shit in my little world hits the fan. Basically  I couldn't stay hard and that kicks a man's pride right in the dick. I couldn't figure out why, I was very into it and so was she. I thought this could be because of PIED or just nervousness and anxiety at work. All of them were probable causes but I brushed it off. Until it happens again the very next week. I then figured it was due to the constant M that desensitized my comrade downstairs. Mind you this relationship was around days 88 to about 118. \n\nThe relationship failed when she would constantly act depressed just to keep the attention on her. Even though all of my attention was already on her. Bad move on her part. \n\nI felt a few urges to break because of feeling like complete shit but I remained vigilant and carried on. This is where I basically broke down to a bare being. My sexual desires dissipated. I wasn't attracted to anything at this point (days 134). I became a non-sexual seeking entity. Everything I did at point was only to advance my survival in this world. My life settled into a daily rut. This is the turning point of everything and it was what I believe to be the underlying reason of nofap. You go to your darkest to see the brightest. Once I came out of this I knew what I wanted, a real relationship. Not just some booty call. \n        \nAt this point my thought process was almost crystal clear. Looking for the girl. Not just the body. Some other effects I noticed was my ability and the strength of my self control. I rarely unleash on people anymore and I don't hurt myself when pissed off now. If anything this was fantastic to have acquired. My confidence to pursue girls multiplied immensely. I was now able to hold legitimate conversations with cute girls, maintain fluency, and even spark up the conversation on my own. All of this was phenomenal. The only thing keeping me down was the not being able to stay hard. It took a devastating mental toll on me. \n\nWhile being single I ultimately dropped my worries about PIED and came to terms with it. Then out of nowhere the whore of my school wants to hang out with me (It may seem harsh putting it that way but she knows it and so does everybody else.) and I agree to it but I brought my closest friend with me as a safety net. He was well aware of his role that night. We all hang out, go to eat, then I decide its the nice thing to do to walk her home. Keep in mind she wouldn't stop dropping hints about her having sex that night. It was obvious she wanted the D. But I had no real intentions to give it. So we get to her house and watch a raunchy movie. Then as I am getting ready to haul ass home (it was 1 o'clock in the morning and I was in the shit of the ghetto), she instantly starts making out with me. All tongue, not even a starter kiss. As that continued clothes were beginning to come off and we go up stairs to her room. She tries putting me in her and I veto that instantly for two reasons. No condom and she was riding the crimson tide at the time.  \n\nWelp, she finds a condom, I'm just weirded out for the most part. I put it on, she gets on top, tries to get in, comes back up before I get in and there is blood on the tip of my wang. Lost all interest, got soft(not  because of the blood), and then she begins talking to my penis. Shit got weird, fast. I leave shortly after that. But from this I picked up its not really nervousness or anxiety for why I fail at it in bed. The condom just doesn't agree with me. And that's unfortunate because there is no way in hell I am having sex with anyone without a condom on. And I am perfectly fine with this situation. The time will come when shit actually does work for once. \n\nFast forward a few months to the end of summer and I meet a really sweet Ukrainian girl that my good friend hooked me up with. She came from an extremely strict family and a cult-like religious background. Her father was a Russian soldier during the Soviet Union days and now is a pastor for their church and to top it off he cheats on his wife(yep... For a man of god that makes sense). She had little contact with the outside world beside her family who either share the same strict ideals or completely ruined their lives with stupid decision because of the same strict living conditions. We made the relationship work for a bit, she would sneak out of her house whenever possible, which was very scarce and I hate texting so everything became very stale. She would also act like a therapist to everyone and she would always want to tell me about other peoples problem and not even discuss how our day was. A few pros to this while situation was texting meant sending pictures and we are two promiscuous teenager so I hope you can connect the dots on this one. But she would want to do this picture messaging at the weirdest times, like in school or when she was talking someone down from self harming. What put the last nail in the coffin on this failing relationship was the fact that she was put into a arranged marriage by her father. She didn't agree with this but she also didn't seem too upset over it. She said she was going to undermine the whole thing by acting like an ass to the other family. I believed her, but nothing would have saved the relationship from this train wreck. So I promptly ended it and she was somewhat ok with it. It was a clean break despite the situation. \n\nNow to Christmas eve, the most peculiar event happens, I had my first wet dream ever. For seventeen and a half year I never had one. But what made this even more odd is that it wasn't just one release, it was two. I think everything just went back to factory settings that morning. You could say it was a white Christmas, (no pun intended, well maybe a little). I stayed strong and fought the chaser effect. That was a challenge all onto itself.\n\nMost importantly to realize about my situation is that sex shouldn't be goal orientated(Orgasm shouldn't be the goal) it should be pleasure orientated. And with that in mind everything can be great and an overall amazing experience. \n\nNofap is overall a great endeavor I intend to continue to partake in, some people try to convince me to break it because they believe that's why I can't stay up. Despite these suggestion I'm continuing the journey and search for some concrete answers to this all. I must say the random erections are less frequent since beginning this but when I do get hard, it's fucking steel. Morning wood? Nah, morning titanium. I usually fantasize about having a happy relationship with a girl than having physical intimacy. It's wonderful not thinking sex is the focal point of women existence. Now I do want to make this clear to everyone, I have a slight fear of the day I do release my special man juice. It's been over 350 days. I may literally shoot an eye out. But what ever the case may be it will be crazy and I hope it is with the right girl. Because there would be a better chance she would forgive me if she goes blind. \n\nSo my fellow fapstronauts, one and all. I know you all know this but it's worth repeating, you are all revolutionaries of our time, this is the road less traveled not only because it is difficult, but also because this is where the men are sorted from the boys. And for those ladies out there, kudos. Your journey is just as significant as anyone's else. \n        \nJust remember whatever your end goal may be, wherever your motivation is, for whatever reason you are partaking in this great crusade for, make sure it is for the right reasons and to stay true to yourself and to never sell yourself short. Walk tall with your heads held high for we are giants.\n","retrieved_on":1441977820,"ups":4,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":"year1","num_comments":3,"id":"1u55zk","archived":true,"name":"t3_1u55zk","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"author":"TSgtMeddle24","from":null,"is_self":true,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1u55zk/nofap_2013achievement_unlocked_my_journey_to/","subreddit_id":"t5_2skrn","from_kind":null,"created":1388554381,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"edited":1388555700,"score":4}
