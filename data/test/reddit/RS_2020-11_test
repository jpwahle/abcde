I am 47, and I started HRT on Oct. 7th, My Doc is in Denver and I live in Oklahoma. She was highly recommended, so I drove to Denver to see her start my transitioning\n\nI already had blood work done prior to seeing the Doc. Starting out my T was at 201. Doc put me on EV injections 20mg, 10mg\/.5ml Evey two weeks and 50mg once a day for Spiro. After a week and half, my normal doc here in OK needed me to do a 6th month follow up for normal yearly check up. She did a test on T again... to my shock, my T is at &lt;2.5 and my FSH couldn't even be read, so no numbers there, but before hand it was like 41 I think, I don't remember off the top of my head. \n\nAnyway, why I ask if I am a mutant is because I have been on cloud nine, I have never felt so good in my life. Changes so far from 10\/1 to 10\/31.\n\n1 - cloud nine feeling\n2 - not depressed anymore (because I stopped fighting this feeling for 42 years)\n3 - appetite has went way down. Not really hungry like I was in Cave Man mode.\n4 - Skin softening \n5 - Breast soreness and growth already. (have to hide the headlights now) \n6 - Touch is different\n7 - my bright blue eyes are now turning green ( WTF... I wasn't expecting this)\n8 - Started crying at a touching scene in a comedy movie (crying and laughing at myself and my best friend laughing with me... good times!)\n9 - very very vivid dreams\n\nNow some I was expecting, but some I was not expecting this early and more around 3 month mark. \nMy first follow up with Denver Doc was last Tuesday and she was super surprised as well. She stated she has helped over 300 girls and none has had T suppressed that fast and growth signs as well this early in this stage. She was very pleased and stated that it was like my body was starving for this. She uped my injections to 40 mg a month, which is 10mg \/ .5ml every week. I asked for every week, because I do not feel pain with the injections and plus the half-life. \n\nI am excited and scared at the same time. I wasn't expecting so soon on the breast changing this fast. Yes I have to wear a bra and double up shirts (thank you winter time). My next Doc app with her is Dec. 27th and I will draw my blood checking E levels in-between my shots. Mutant, I am????? At my age, I shouldn't see this progress this fast. I have always looked young for my age. People think I am in my later 30's and are shocked I am 47 with grandkids. I am not comfy yet to post pics, as I am still in caveman mode. I start laser hair next Friday. \n\nOklahoma is horrible for us girls. My Insurance pays for everything through my job (Cigna). My company has selected the full coverage package plan for Trans and they support \ud83d\udcaf. I am having hard time to find trans friendly that takes Cigna. I have to pay out of pocket for laser hair to face right now. \n\nSorry for long rant, happy Halloween \ud83c\udf83 all!! \n\nMutant or what?????","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ask_transgender","subreddit_id":"t5_31hoq","subreddit_subscribers":38763,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Am I a Mutant or is this normal progression?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.93,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ask_transgender\/comments\/jlsw3y\/am_i_a_mutant_or_is_this_normal_progression\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I will put a TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n**Backstory:**\n\nI never had many friends and was always the introverted kind of person. I had one friend who I knew since kindergarten. He was my only friend and I was his only friend, it was great. We'd constantly hang out together. We had basically the same interests and I vividly remember playing Pokemon, Mario Kart and other stuff with him and talking about TV shows for hours. \n\nWhen elementary school ended, I was very anxious about getting into some random school where I didn't know anyone, so I desperately tried to get into the school he \/ his parents picked. This wasn't a school I particularly wanted to go to but I'd do anything to go to school with someone I knew. In the end, it all worked out and we went to the same school together. \n\nNow here's where things went sideways. Apparently I wasn't good enough for him anymore. He started to hang out with other people and didn't have time for me anymore. His new friends all hated me. \n\nI took that very badly. I was very anxious again about having no friends and knowing nobody and desperately tried to stay friends with him. Sadly, he noticed that and decided to use it to his advantage. He started forcing me to do things for him. Carrying heavy stuff, doing his homework, buying things for him, etc. He would take my stuff and my money as he pleased. \n\nWhenever I objected to any of his doings, he would hurt me. Like, I'm talking physical violence here. He would kick me, punch me, slap me or stab me (with pens or pencils). Unfortunately, the 12 year old, anxious, stupid idiot that I was still thought I could make the friendship work. He promised me over and over that he wouldn't hurt me anymore. He would stop for like a week but then start again. This went on for months.\n\nAround that same time, I began not wanting to go to school. I faked migraines and stomach aches and having a cold. I remember thinking how I was such a great actor and everyone totally fell for it and how I can now watch TV all day. I felt happy. Days became weeks, weeks became months. Obviously, my parents and the school weren't stupid and knew something was up. They somehow got the idea that I was too stressed from schoolwork and therefore developed anxiety. I ran with it, although at the time I still thought I was just great at skipping school. They forced me to do therapy, but that didn't do anything because I didn't even realize that I have a problem yet. \n\nAt the end of that school year, they gave me a choice of either retaking the grade or switching to a lower level school and continuing with the next grade there. This was because I had missed too much stuff and couldn't continue with the next grade at my school. It was a very hard choice but I eventually chose switching schools because I couldn't bear the thought of retaking the grade at my old school (in regards of everyone making fun of me, thinking I'm a loser, etc.). \n\nThe new school was rougher than the old one. People would drink alcohol and smoke, the teachers wouldn't care. I was bullied by a few people but most of my new classmates were actually pretty nice and even made an effort talking to me and including me in stuff. I went there for a few months but then it started again. The \"not wanting to go to school\". I now finally realized that I had a problem and wasn't just a genius at skipping school. I still didn't know what caused it, though. I didn't make the connection. My brain just kinda buried all of the bad stuff from before. \n\nSo I tried therapy again\u2026 and again\u2026 and again. My mom took me to a lot of doctors and specialists. I was really making an effort trying to get help, I talked to them and told them everything my brain considered to be relevant at the time. The abuse stuff wasn't part of it. None of them could help me. They diagnosed me with depression, social anxiety and even Asperger's (which I never believed to be true). I also tried tons of meds (mostly antidepressants as far as I remember) that didn't do anything but cause a lot of side effects. \n\nIn the end, I just accepted that I am like this and that there is nothing I can do. After all, what else could I have done?\n\nI dropped out of school after that year. I barely graduated with the lowest degree you can get in the education system of my country. The grades are horrible (because of all the stuff I missed). Everyone who looks at that degree must think I'm the stupidest person on earth.  \n\nMy life then basically froze at this point. It has been 15 years, I'm 27 now. I still live with my mother, I still don't have friends and barely accomplished anything during that time. I also began to eat a lot (trying to fill the void inside of me) so I'm obese which lowers my self-esteem even more. I absolutely hate myself. I made a few more failed attempts at therapy but eventually just accepted that I'm broken and will probably never have an enjoyable life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now to the part that happened recently:**\n\nJust a few days ago, I was browsing YouTube as I often do and got a seemingly random video in my recommendations. I had never watched that channel before or even knew it existed. I gave it a try and liked it, so I started randomly watching some other videos on the channel. I eventually get to one talking about toxic relationships (a topic I would have never looked for in a million years). I'm halfway in when it suddenly hits me like a truck at max speed. It all came back. It was buried so deep. But watching this video and hearing an exact description of my relationship with this guy finally made me connect the dots. \n\nDespite of all the self-hatred, having a shit life, having wasted all of my youth and now knowing the person who is responsible gets away with it, I still can't help but smile right now. Am I crazy? It feels like all of this weight of not knowing what's wrong with me has finally been lifted. I'm so eager to try therapy again, knowing exactly what I should talk about. This feels like an issue where therapy and talking about it can actually help me. I also really want to start losing weight. Not doing that stuff sooner because I thought I was unfixable seems so stupid to me now. \n\nI realize I shouldn't be overconfident. \"Fixing myself\" will take years. I'll probably be in my thirties before I can live a normal life, if ever. But still, I'm so hyped right now. There's hope again. I feel things that I haven't felt in 10 years. Part of me doesn't even believe this is real. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still wonder. What if someone had told me about this 10 years ago? What if one of the therapists had asked me about abusive relationships in my past? Could all this wasted time have been saved? Could I have a happy life right now? Or did it take my brain all those years to process what happened? I also wonder about why the guy did this to me. Did he suffer from abuse himself? Or was he just a psychopath? \n\nAnyway, thanks so much for reading my story. I feel like just writing this has helped me get some clarity on things. I'm somehow way more comfortable talking (or writing) about this stuff in English than I would be in my native language. Anyone else feel like that? I wonder why that is. And I hope it won't hinder my therapy sessions in the future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR** \n\nLife went to shit after an abusive friendship; didn't realize; went insane about having shit life for no apparent reason; finally made the connection after 15 years; feeling positive about things now","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"therapy","subreddit_id":"t5_2r76d","subreddit_subscribers":78236,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I finally realized what's wrong with me after 15 years","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/therapy\/comments\/jlswwr\/i_finally_realized_whats_wrong_with_me_after_15\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Also big time porn addict- unknowingly for 5 years and knowingly for maybe a little over a year. I am really confused about my career choices. I feel like my mind has been exposed to way too many things for me to narrow down on one. So im leaving it on this community to help me make a decision. I will writing down some honest facts as to where i stand today, please choose the option which you think works best for me after reading the supporting facts:\n\n1) So I have my bachelor in business and law but I rarely focused on studies during my 6 years in college since I was busy getting high or fucking most of the time. Sometimes i wonder how i even graduated. It was really a miracle. But I do have a professional degree so I can look at a future in the legal services. It will take me 4-5 years and I can look at a decent salary. But I fucking hate doing it which is why even though I'm out of college for over 2 years I have never tried to get a job in that field. \n2) Towards the end of last year, i tried doing standup comedy,, it was an impulse decision. I always liked the idea of being famous but I am really very shy and introverted so could never decide if it was a good fit for me. I was sick of sitting at home and having no clue about where my life was headed so I just gave it a try and surprisingly my first ever open mic went really well. But after that, when I tried to audition for more open mics, I realised that it came with a long waiting period. I mean it was really difficult to get spots and once you did, sometimes not a lot of people showed up. Honestly, I loved being on stage like the thrill of it but I hated the long process of waiting before I got the chance to perform. So till march of this year, I must have done about 8-10 open mics out of which I recorded one set and even uploaded on my YouTube which got like 1200 views. Also, I even gave a shot at recording funny home videos like me playing different characters sort of vines and surprisingly those too got decent viewership averaging about 1000 views on every video which I thought was great compared to the small number of followers I had on my Instagram. But suddenly one day I realised that this is bullshit and just stopped making videos. Like seriously I havent posted anything on my instgram. I was literally very active for 4-5 months and then one day I just stopped posting. I have so many messages from people asking me why I don't make vidros any more. I just dont know what to say to them. One reason why I stopped making content was because firstly, it was difficult to keep a track of my nofap while being online you know IG is filled with erotica and the other reason most importantly i didnt know how to scale my content. Looking back I feel fuckrd up about stopping to make those videos. I had a fun time doing all that. \n3) okay the last resort I have is joining my dads business. I have literally no interest in that and it is not even that great that I could you know expand it. It is kinda working at its best capacity and it is onky helping us to keep afloat. So honestly, it will be like kidding myself rhat I work with my dad because honestly it will still mean that I take poket money from him. And I dont have such a good relationship with him. I mean the man is a little narcissistic so no matter what I do il always fall short of his expectations. But my only reason to consider this option is because i think staying at home might help me overcome my addictions especially PMO. In my 7 months at home, I have stopped smoking pot completely, also stopped smoking cogaretes for 2 months now but I'm fuckimg alone. All my friends actually just 2 are in different cities. I have nobody to talk to here and honestly I dont know if I can say woth full conviction that I can trust myself with stayung alone again. \n\nOkay! That was all. \nFor both option one and two il have to move away from home because my current city doesn't offer many opportunities in those fields. So yeah please help me make a choice now that you know the deal. \n\n\nChoose from the below options:\n1) practise law \n2) standup comedy \n3) dads business \n\nType 1, 2 or 3 in comments \n\nThanks in advance:)\nAnd yeah nofap has been going strong 11 days baby:D","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"NoFap","subreddit_id":"t5_2skrn","subreddit_subscribers":825242,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"What would you do?

It's 450gsm  light pearl weave, collar is stiff eva foam and pants are 11oz twill cotton. I'm 6'0, 220, and I got the A3.\n\nIt ran a bit large and there wasn't anything special about the cut, but it was blank and perfect for a beginner. I shrank it by washing in hot water and throwing it in the dryer, and it shrank about 2\" in sleeves and pants.\n\nRolling in it was never a discomfort, but it would become stiff when hung to dry so there was a break in period everytime I would throw it on. It reminded me of a Fuji All Around, but I would say that Fuji is a bit softer on your skin without a rashguard\/spatz.\n\nI used it approximately 3-4 times a week, washing after every use, and it has started to show piling in certain areas across the jacket. Never experienced any tears or fraying.\n\nI would recommend this gi if you've only got $80, but would suggest saving an extra $20 and checking out some Fujis. There's always 10% or 20% off sales going on that make it a better investment.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"bjj","subreddit_id":"t5_2qn02","subreddit_subscribers":283556,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Ronin Brand Plain Gi Review","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.88,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bjj\/comments\/jlt2sb\/ronin_brand_plain_gi_review\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

If all goes according to plan, I will graduate the semester after the next one, which will mean finishing my 4 year degree in 5 and a half years. I was diagnosed with a learning disorder when I was 5 years old, and spent my time in school in special ed. It's sometimes hard for me to tell if I really do have a learning disability, especially since the last time I was tested was 7th grade. I'm supposedly mildly autistic, but I know I have no problems with reading people or saying accidently insensitive things or anything like that. My main issue is being able to follow more specific directions, which make things like math and hands on type work extremely difficult for me. Regardless, this consistently resulted in me being in special ed and standard classes throughout school. I struggled a lot early on in college as I majored in general studies and had to drop a few classes, until two things happened: I went through an experience that, while very bad at the time, ultimately improved my self confidence quite a bit, and found that I actually really enjoy political science classes and perform rather well in them. In short, I am finishing late primarily due to struggles from when I first started in college. Also early on I sometimes took only three classes, and even now I have only ever taken four. My parents, specifically my dad, have been footing the bill throughout my time in college. I believe he is able to do this since I am an only child, I went to community college for the first 3 semesters and am doing my last two and a half at a cheap in state college while living at home (I did spend one semester on campus though which he paid for, but I was able to get out of doing it for another semester despite it normally being a year long contract) and My grandfather passing away and leaving him some money a little after I started college. Also he's pretty close to retirement age and has a decent amount in savings. From what I understand, we are pretty middle middle class. I have not ever been formally employed, either in high school or college. I have always had some self-esteem issues, but right now they are really bad as I feel as though I have not earned any of my recent success in college (I have been on deans list the past two semesters, and I appear to be on track to do so again) or really much of anything in my life. I feel like I should be working to help pay at least somewhat, but my mom is really, really against the idea and wants me to focus on my studies. Sad part is, I know she's probably right. My grades probably would drop at least to some extent if I was working. I already feel pretty worn out a lot of the time (My main responsibility's outside of school are helping out in some ways at home (though my mom is kind of a control freak with it, and I sometimes have had to push to get more responsibilities)  and providing emotional support to a friend of mine who is both going through a lot and is extremely talkative, which leads to phone conversations that typically range from 1-3 hours at least a couple times a week, often more). Still though, I look at other college students who are both working AND need to take out student loans, and I feel like absolute garbage for my luck. Sorry, this was really long, but I just am really having trouble with this right now. I'm scared it will affect my grades at some point if this keeps up, which would just make me feel way worse. Thanks for reading, and any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Guilt","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhob","subreddit_subscribers":2374,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My parents are paying for college and I hate myself for it.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.87,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Guilt\/comments\/jlt7wr\/my_parents_are_paying_for_college_and_i_hate\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Please read the whole post before sending me a message though.\n\nI'm Ben. I'm 25, from England. This can either be short or long-term depending on what you'd prefer\/our timezones. By day, I work as a journalist for a magazine; this is my way of letting off steam while having fun with words and interesting people, while getting nice and hard.\n\nSo, the scene then: I'm a multi-billionaire and I live in a large mansion by the ocean. You're employed as my toy \/ slut \/ whore. You\u2019re treated well (you have your own Ferrari 458 Italia with the reg plate SLUT among other things - other cars are available) aside from when you\u2019re asked into my room to be my toy and to please and tease me on a regular basis.\n\nI'm looking to play out a 'normal' day, say, six months or so into your 'role' - maybe I've just returned from a few days away on business or I've had a long day at work and need to relax?\n\nThe roleplay will take place in my large bedroom - or any room if you'd rather play out the scene there for that matter. I'm thinking the room should contain a large king-size bed, a red leather sofa, a toybox stuffed to the brim with your favourite toys and a balcony overlooking the ocean.\n\nI'm obviously also open to your ideas though - as this RP is as much yours as it is mine.\n\nI am 6\u20192\u201d tall and have short brown hair and green eyes. I am fit, and have abs and a six-pack, and a slight tan from a recent holiday. Around my face, I have a few freckles and stubble is forming, but I can be clean-shaven in the RP. I also wear glasses, but again, these can go in the RP, and most importantly, I have an eight-incher. Did I miss anything?\n\nGood spelling and grammar will be appreciated (I can't believe I'm writing this, but don't get into a hissy fit and say 'I didn't realise this was an English test straight away' when I correct 'u' to 'you' and 'r u ok hun?' to 'fuck off and don't message me again') and I like to include your fetishes during the RP. I will obviously steer away from any limits too, so please mention both to me when you PM me.\n\nIf you like the sound of the scene but want to tweak a few things, please send me a message anyway - I'm very easy-going :)\n\nMy kinks (in no particular order) are: anal, assplay, ass to mouth, teasing, toys, outfits (I like to discuss outfits before we get going), MFF threesomes, being teased, slapping, spanking, oral, facesitting, tittfucking and rimming. If you're unsure or don't like any of the above, please let me know.\n\nWhen you message me, please for heavens' sake, don't just send a one-line message saying 'I saw your post' or 'Hey'. What do you expect me to do with this information? Congratulate you for reading a post on Reddit and then sending me a message on Kik? Say \u2018hi\u2019 back and the await a tedious back-and-forth as I try to get information out of you like blood out of a stone?\n\nI'm sick to death of people sending minimal openers in response to my posts - given I have posted the scene, the make-up of the room and my fetishes, there is an awful lot of 'flesh'. Introduce yourself, tell me about your kinks and where you're from. Anything, really, just don't send me a one-line message saying 'Hi' unless you want me to ignore you and block you.\n\nI see lots of females grumbling about blokes who can't be bothered to send a decent opener, but the same appears to be true when the coin is flipped in my (limited) experience.\n\nAnyway, I hope that hasn't put you off messaging me - I hope to see some activity in my inbox soon; my Kik is Benfox127","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DirtyKIKRoleplay","subreddit_id":"t5_3kem5","subreddit_subscribers":39651,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M4F] The Billionaire\u2019s Fucktoy","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DirtyKIKRoleplay\/comments\/jltdxh\/m4f_the_billionaires_fucktoy\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I can play multiple characters so this can be long term or short term.

I'm 21 yrs old (female) and I recently started to drink alcohol when with my friends and I got a little too drunk last night. I will now type everything I remember from last night in the order that they happened.\n\nPart 1: Starting to drink the moment we get to J's apartment\n\nI got to my friends apartment (J \\[male\\]) and my friend M (female) and I decided to shotgun a white claw the moment we walked in. So there we were downing it in like a minute. I took longer since its very bubbly and I don't like the taste of it. After we did that, we got some cups to do shots of vodka. I took like 3 shots of it. Then, we tried smirnoffs since the both of us never tried it before. It tasted like Sprite to us so we were content. At this point, the both of us were tipsy and we knew we were about to get drunk af. We drank a little bit of the smirnoff and then in our cups that we did our shots in, we filled it up half way with this other alcohol that i actually don't know what it is and poured the rest of our smirnoff. What a mistake that was. Not only did we now have a solo cup filled with alcohol, but it also tasted very bad.\n\nPart 2: Conversations while the alcohol was starting to hit us\n\nWe drank all that alcohol while in the kitchen and then we started to talk with our other friends that were passing by. We ended up sitting on the floor and just talking. We eventually got up and she started talking to another friend about their ochem class. I then leave to go sit on the couch. While making my way to the couch I see my friends faces and then once on the couch I forget what happens the rest of the night except for the small parts I do remember.\n\nPart 3: the part I do remember\n\nI might have been at the apartment for maybe an hour and a half by the time I go sit on the couch. To be honest, I literally had no idea what time it was throughout the night. I was just vibing. While at the couch, I remember snuggling with this guy I met that day. I vaguely remember this cuddling session (theres another one coming up). There was quite a few of us at J's apartment, so the next thing I do is ask where my friend L is because I said hi to her when I got there but now I don't see her. I get informed she went home. I also notice theres less of us than originally. I go pee sometime during the night and I see my friend M (the one I got drunk with) and she is knocked out on J's bed. Then I don't remember what happens but next I remember is I am puking my guts out in the toilet. My good friend E (male) is kind enough to be next to me as I throw up. I think he's the one who held my hair back. I don't know why but I stick by him for a while but I don't remember how long because then I remember being with E, J, and A (female) in the living room talking. E and J are sitting in the dining chairs while I'm on the couch and A is on the floor. A is snapchating all these guys and I'm there too doing who knows what because I don't remember. Then it's time to go to bed.\n\nPart 4: bed time\n\nAt this point it's only me, E, J, A, and M still at the apartment. I was told it was probably 3am when we decided to go to sleep. M has been knocked out since she knocked out on J's bed. A moves her near the head board since she fell asleep sideways on the bed. J says he's sleeping on the couch. E says he's sleeping on the floor next to the bed so that me and A can sleep on the bed with M. That's when I clearly remember not letting him sleep on the floor. A is helping me get him up since I'm drunk af. I tell him I'm not going to sleep unless he sleeps on the bed with us 3 girls. He eventually gives in and gets on the bed. I then go turn off all the lights in the apartment and get on the bed. On the bed is M, A, E, and then me. I'm on the edge and I go to sleep. I wake up once to go pee and once to get water. I wake up again and I find myself cuddling with E. Do I un-cuddle with him? No because I am still drunk. I try to go back to sleep but it takes me a while but all I remember is the cuddling and how my arm is on his chest and his arm is wrapped around me. Then I knock out again and don't wake up until 12pm. By that time M and E have already left, so it's just me and A on the bed. \n\nPart 5: the next day, Saturday\n\nNow here I am, embarrassed for the things I remember doing and ashamed for not remembering anything else. I don't know what I will do or say when I see the first guy I cuddled with or how I will face E when I see him again. What I learned is that I need to get drunk again because who knows what embarrassing things I can do. Will M and I have a round 2? Maybe. Most likely yes. Will I be able to face E on Sunday since J, him, and I go to mass together? Maybe. Most likely I will be embarrassed and get shy since he clearly was not drunk last night.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"story","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnny","subreddit_subscribers":10808,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Last night was my second time getting drunk in my life","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/story\/comments\/jltihd\/last_night_was_my_second_time_getting_drunk_in_my\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

Just want to get this out of my chest.\n\nSome weeks ago, I was trying to schedule a swimming for today because it's cool, outdoors and safer when you remember we still have covid-19. Those 3 friends said ok. So I asked again last week to confirm, because we have to buy tickets to enter the swim, and one said no, the other on had something and the other one didn't want to go without the gang. Ok. Until 2 days ago, I was thinking about going alone, but turns out the weather is rainy where a live, so no chance of doing it anyway.\n\nThen another person said he was going to stop by to chat. I said fine. And then I waited. And waited, and waited, and waited. He was supposed to stop by around lunch, but haven't said nothing still. And I doubt a lot that something seriously happened, because he does that all the time (disappear faster than a ninja because is convenient).\n\nThen another person was talking to me yesterday, telling me about his depression and loneliness and etc, and I suggested we could do something today. He said yes. So I suggested 6 nice places to go. He answered today saying he was a little hesitant to go out because he thinks his car has some problem. He didn't want to ask for a uber because is expensive, even though he makes a lot of money. Public transportation is complicated because of covid. And every time I asked \"ok, so what do you suggest?\", he said he could leave his car here, go to place A (that's 10km from my house), and if this place wasn't good, we could go to place B (5km distant from A), or come back to the neighborhood I live. I mean, oh man, he didn't even bother to look at the address of the places I sent to him. And when I said \"ok, I understand your concerns, but can you confirm if you are going by lunch? I don't like to stay at this limbo\", he took a time and confirmed he was going a little after lunch. Ok. But then he cancelled hours ago. Holy s\\*\\*t. I was already in the mental process of going out, and organized my day so I was able to do so.\n\nSo yes, I know I can do the things alone, but I do them all the time. I'm not a people person AT ALL. Once in a while, I feel lonely and would appreciate some company... and those things happen.\n\nI know I should meet new people and try to make new friends, but I REALLY don't even know from where to start. I'm 34 now, people aren't really that open to new friendship at this age range.  I'm lame at everything more social I could do (RPG, music, acting, soccer). My hobbies are usually just for one (solo games, reading, watching movies, programming), so the other ones who like that are doing it alone too lol. And I don't know where to find people likeminded, who vibrate at the same energy as me, and won't dump me because something better showed up or will forget all the friends because now they are dating and have someone do f\\*\\*k.  I also don't get with normies and dumb people, so I really feel like an outsider on enviroments like bars, barbecues, parties and so on.\n\nYes, my life is not so good right know, but I guess I need to get used to it.

I did not go to college it just wasn't something for me but, I have a stable job as a secretary and my own place and vehicle. I don't have a lot of hobbies, I like to stay in and eat good food. I don't like cooking but, I will do the dishes if someone else cooks. I have a taste for the finer things in life like Ballet shows and Broadway, fine restaurants and flowers. I like camping but, I hate bugs and I don't like the beach. I have a wonderful evil cat who is my entire world so we are a package deal. I am big on cuddling and being with my partner as much as I can be, that means I am overly clingy but, I do understand working and I hope you do too.\n\nHonestly, I don't want another LDR but, I am open to it and I don't mind relocating; however I would prefer if I didn't have too. I am not an outgoing person and I am very quiet natured; people scare me. I don't like to play video games but, I will watch if it interests me. I love horror movies and Disney; I am hoping to find someone who likes those too. I don't do bars or clubs, I do like going to the movies from time to time. Theres not much to me I am a rather boring person and that's not really going to change.\n\nI am looking for someone who has their life together and is fairly tall, 5'10 or taller and someone who has sort of a muscley dad bod. They would enjoy waking up early with me and helping me do daily things. I want someone who makes me want to be happy because they're happy with me and they must, you must be emotionally stable enough to handle how much of a crybaby I am. This person would be okay with tattoos and they must like sushi or foods that you can get at sushi places. I am a smoker but, I'm trying to quit so someone who can help me would be great. I want someone who is understanding and very patient with me, someone who listens to me and hears what I have to say when things are rough.\n\nI am NOT looking for someone who is a sadist or into anything rough, they must be gentle and caring. Someone who doesn't like drinking too much and doesn't party either. I am looking for a mature gentleman who will open the door for me and tuck me in at night. I am demisexual so they must be understanding of that. This person is hopefully kinky and has some experience as I am not experienced. I am looking for someone who can boost myself confidence and who is as cuddly as me. I DO NOT want someone more than 8 years older than me but, 9 and 10 are not the end of the world if we get along and things go well.\n\nI am extremely possessive of the person I am with and hopefully you are too; that being said I am not open to poly, I am strictly monogamous. I want to get married someday and I am really trying to find the right guy for me. I do not want kids but with the right person and under the right circumstances, I would be open to a kid one day; for now though it is still off the table.\n\nSo yes, I am a little and a kitten but, it is more like a submissive with little and kitten tendencies; my little side and kitten side are not entirely sexual and I would like to keep them that way. These things are woven into my personality and are part of who I am currently. All this being said I'm wanting someone who wants to please me, I say this because I am not a slave or anywhere near a slave; I will NOT service you just to service you, not that type of submissive.\n\nIf these things sound alright with you, I hope we can chat or you reach out to me because I am ready to be done with the games and lies. I am ready for peace with another person...\n\nThank you for reading and I hope to hear from you soon, I really would like to get to know someone and hopefully hit things off.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"cglpersonals","subreddit_id":"t5_3nfh7","subreddit_subscribers":4135,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"22F [F4A] Southeast LA, Little Looking for Soft Daddy\/Caregiver","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.67,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cglpersonals\/comments\/jlttf7\/22f_f4a_southeast_la_little_looking_for_soft\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I'm new to the sub. I'm a 31 year old trans woman from New York originally but moved to Spain.\n\nI began my transition last year. At this point I blend in but don't always pass. I would say I pass most of the time though.\n\nWhat I'm writing you all about is to discuss a concern of mine I have been toying with for longer than just today.\n\nI'm thinking about changing careers.\nI have been a system's engineer for the last 7 years (after I graduated uni).\nI really feel like this career doesn't match my personality.\nI'm a very social and bubbly woman who needs to interact with people and make meaningful differences in other people's life.\n\nI'm hesitating between two professions:\n\nWedding planner\n\nMedical administrative secretary\n\nBoth of these are professions I can convert to in a reasonable time frame and without going into debt for another expensive college education.\n\nI have come to these careers because they both match my interests but also my personality I think. \n\nI know that professions are not gendered anymore nowadays but I feel horrible being the only woman in my entire work field in my larger area. \n\nI want a profession that's more common for women to work in and that matches my feminine personality more. \n\nOn the basis of salary, I'm making a decent salary for myself nowadays and I have 7 years of seniority so I earn well with all taken into account but I'm not happy with my job and I wonder how I can continue for another 34 years in a job that makes me deeply unhappy. I have right to retirement at 65. I can't imagine just continueing doing a job that I'm fed up with at 31 till I'm 65.\n\nIn about a year I could convert to a new profession if I started with the necessary courses (education) now. \n\nNowadays a lot of schools offer distance education which would allow me to continue earning a living while also working towards a career transition. \n\nMy current field is also not really tolerant towards trans people in my humble opinion. \n\nWhile I haven't had any direct bad experiences and while everyone respects me, I often see that some of my colleagues like terribly saddening stuff on Facebook that divulges how they think about LGBT people. \n\nAs a wedding planner I would be able to perform in a job that is more associated with womanhood and femininity and I would honestly feel lots of gender euphoria from this alone. I also like organizing events and I'm really punctual and precise when I'm doing so. \nI also have a good taste in fashion and a good eye for details like colors and so on. \n\nAs a medical secretary I would be responsible to register new patient's files, I would be able to make a major difference in a work field that needs lots of medically trained people and I would be more accepted in this sector. This is also a profession that is more associated with women than men. \nAs a child I was already very interested in medical science and my dream as a child was to become an oncologist. As I'm now too old to go for years on end to university to change careers, I could opt for a profession in the medical field that is easier to convert to and where I could still make a meaningful difference. \nMedical secretary means I could still take the blood pressure of the patient, register their medical history in the system etc... \nAll things which sound interesting to me and which would allow me to get in touch with people on a daily basis. \n\nI'm a people's person, I'm nurturing, I'm open minded, I'm a person that loves to learn a lot of new skills, I love to make meaningful differences in the world etc.\n\nDid any of you change careers after transition to a more ''feminine'' profession because you were fed up with your previous career and because it gave you gender dysphoria?\n\nWould love to hear your insights on my choice to change careers. \n\nAlso, which of the two mentioned would be more welcoming of and suitable for a trans woman of my age?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MtF","subreddit_id":"t5_2ub9j","subreddit_subscribers":113112,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Changing careers during \/ after transition?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MtF\/comments\/jltvkz\/changing_careers_during_after_transition\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I am going bald at 28. All of it is in the front in the typical male pattern baldness way.\n\nThe interesting thing is that NO ONE in my family has this except both me and my brother. I'm an incel. (I don't like to use that term, but it's the best way to describe me.) I'm worse, but I'm 4 years older than him. He's not an incel, but very close to it. I think he's only had one experience before.\n\nSo we are both balding very young even though it does not run in the family at all. My theory is that if you've got high testosterone and aren't getting laid, it builds up and causes hair loss. We both have pretty decent testosterone (have a good jaw line and most of the other features of high T). I dislike the incel community for many reasons, one of them being when I describe that I'm tall and have a good jawline, then I must be either lying or not trying, but that's not the case. I'm just socially awkward AF.\n\nDoes anyone else relate?

Slowly but surely making my way through learning how to pick locks consistently.\n\nI've started by getting from Banggood that one clear practice padlock set that comes with a dozen or so picks and three tensioners, mainly because I didn't have the money to spend on better picks. That practice lock was a cinch, and the other key lock I had, a small no-name Chinese padlock, was relatively simple as well. I ordered a practice lock set from Sparrows and wanted to make my own picks while I wait for them to arrive. I believe the tools I already have should work for that, so in the interest of saving money for now my goal is to use scrap metal.\n\nI live in an apartment building in New York City. To save money during my current stay-at-home period I'm not taking the train anywhere. I do not have an auto parts store within walking distance of me so I do not have access to their thrown out windshield wipers for wiper blade insert scavenging. There are no metal scrap yards within walking distance either. Our street sweepers do not often leave broken sweeper blades in the streets if any break at all. However, it rained the other day and as I was walking outside I expected to see umbrellas discarded for various reasons. NYC did not disappoint me in this regard, and I took it upon myself to retrieve those umbrellas for science!\n\nI have fully disassembled these 1.5 umbrellas (one was only the top half), yielding a decent amount of potentially usable scrap metal:\n\n* some very thin wire rods (maybe 24-28 AWG? I don't have my wire stripper handy to measure) about 4-6 inches in length each, some with hook ends and some with loop ends;\n* some thicker wire rods (maybe 16 or 20 AWG?) close to 12 or so inches in length each and with thicker ball tips on one end;\n* many thin bars folded in \"v\" shape lengthwise, some 6 and some 12 inches in length;\n* many folded butterfly-shaped pieces used to connect the v-bars to the thicker rods and the thin wires (some cantilever action)\n* two short (about 3-4 inches each, about 1 inch or so outer diameter), thick (1-2mm), heavy springs\n* one long (12-14 inches probably) medium-to-heavy thick (1-2mm) spring\n* two long (12-14 inches) hollow rods - one fully circular maybe a half inch outer diameter and 3\/8 inch or so inner, one circular but crimped along the entire length and fits inside the other so probably 1\/4 inch pre-crimped outer diameter\n* one 4-6 inch long piece used for the lever action at the base, already shaped like a medium hook but it's almost 2mm thick\n* one 2-3 inch long piece used for the spring detent lever in the middle connecting the two long rods, mostly straight but also almost 2mm thick\n* many tiny rivets\n\nThe problem that I have here is that I have no reliable way of knowing at home what metals make up these pieces so I don't know how viable they could be for everyday-usable picks. Some like the springs are almost certainly spring steel and I'm 60-70% sure the two lever bars are some carbon steel, maybe galvanized, but everything else including the two long rods I'm not sure about. If they were usable the v-bars would most likely become the pick tips, the thicker wire rods would become picks tips and\/or tensioners, the long rods would become handles, and the thin wire rods might be too flexible to be usable at all.\n\nI'm just not sure how many of these pieces are steel of any kind vs aluminum, nor am I sure how usable aluminum would be in making sturdy homemade picks. I'm 90% sure most or all of these v-bars and rods were extruded. I guess the two questions I have here are \"what metals are used in modern umbrellas\" and \"if some\/most\/all of this scrap are not steel are they still usable for making working picks.\"\n\nPlease impart some useful knowledge towards successfully using disassembled umbrellas to make working homemade lockpicks!\n\nUPDATE 11-04: Photo of the disassembled umbrella at https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/2Y7QpH1.jpg","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"lockpicking","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh7k","subreddit_subscribers":160088,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Making picks from disassembled umbrellas?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lockpicking\/comments\/jlu0yu\/making_picks_from_disassembled_umbrellas\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I'm new to the sub. I'm a 31 year old trans woman from New York originally but moved to Spain.\n\nI began my transition last year. At this point I blend in but don't always pass. I would say I pass most of the time though.\n\nWhat I'm writing you all about is to discuss a concern of mine I have been toying with for longer than just today.\n\nI'm thinking about changing careers.\nI have been a system's engineer for the last 7 years (after I graduated uni).\nI really feel like this career doesn't match my personality.\nI'm a very social and bubbly woman who needs to interact with people and make meaningful differences in other people's life.\n\nI'm hesitating between two professions:\n\nWedding planner\n\nMedical administrative secretary\n\nBoth of these are professions I can convert to in a reasonable time frame and without going into debt for another expensive college education.\n\nI have come to these careers because they both match my interests but also my personality I think. \n\nI know that professions are not gendered anymore nowadays but I feel horrible being the only woman in my entire work field in my larger area. \n\nI want a profession that's more common for women to work in and that matches my feminine personality more. \n\nOn the basis of salary, I'm making a decent salary for myself nowadays and I have 7 years of seniority so I earn well with all taken into account but I'm not happy with my job and I wonder how I can continue for another 34 years in a job that makes me deeply unhappy. I have right to retirement at 65. I can't imagine just continueing doing a job that I'm fed up with at 31 till I'm 65.\n\nIn about a year I could convert to a new profession if I started with the necessary courses (education) now. \n\nNowadays a lot of schools offer distance education which would allow me to continue earning a living while also working towards a career transition. \n\nMy current field is also not really tolerant towards trans people in my humble opinion. \n\nWhile I haven't had any direct bad experiences and while everyone respects me, I often see that some of my colleagues like terribly saddening stuff on Facebook that divulges how they think about LGBT people. \n\nAs a wedding planner I would be able to perform in a job that is more associated with womanhood and femininity and I would honestly feel lots of gender euphoria from this alone. I also like organizing events and I'm really punctual and precise when I'm doing so. \nI also have a good taste in fashion and a good eye for details like colors and so on. \n\nAs a medical secretary I would be responsible to register new patient's files, I would be able to make a major difference in a work field that needs lots of medically trained people and I would be more accepted in this sector. This is also a profession that is more associated with women than men. \nAs a child I was already very interested in medical science and my dream as a child was to become an oncologist. As I'm now too old to go for years on end to university to change careers, I could opt for a profession in the medical field that is easier to convert to and where I could still make a meaningful difference. \nMedical secretary means I could still take the blood pressure of the patient, register their medical history in the system etc... \nAll things which sound interesting to me and which would allow me to get in touch with people on a daily basis. \n\nI'm a people's person, I'm nurturing, I'm open minded, I'm a person that loves to learn a lot of new skills, I love to make meaningful differences in the world etc.\n\n\nWould love to hear your insights on my choice to change careers. \n\nAlso, which of the two mentioned would be more welcoming of and suitable for a trans woman of my age?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Career_Advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2v78q","subreddit_subscribers":16412,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Changing careers at 31 y.o. as a trans woman?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.67,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Career_Advice\/comments\/jlu3tt\/changing_careers_at_31_yo_as_a_trans_woman\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

He didn't drag me kicking and screaming into the theater. I was a boy that grew up with a bunch of other boys in a suburban neighborhood in the 70s and 80s and there was nothing on television that matched what you would get in the theater and so we all were wanting to go to see these movies. \n\nTelevision was very sanitized with only 3-4 channels and of course it was a little tiny 15-17\" CRT which was underwhelming to say the least. If anyone remembers movies edited for television it could get pretty hilarious watching something rated R on regular television given how much they would cut out or dub over. For instance I remember we watched Saturday Night Fever edited for television as kids and thought it was a fun movie about disco dancing.\n\nI only came to a realization of how messed up seeing those movies was in context after having my own kid and thinking I would never show any of these films to them at those ages! I remember having nightmares after seeing these things even now! Of course, this just meant I gave my Dad crap about it for fun. I told him recently that he took me to Conan in the theater at age 8 and he looked a bit horrified and said, \"I did?!\"\n\nMy kid would never want to go to one of those movies even if I was crazy enough to take them (my wife would never let it happen either). My kid enjoys watching people play Minecraft and Farming Simulator on YouTube. \n\nIt occurs to me that movies were much more of an experience back then that you didn't want to miss no matter whether it gave you PTSD. It's also interesting that the current movie rating system was only concocted in 1968. I have to wonder how seriously it was taken by people. Heck, I remember when they added the PG-13 rating and people weren't sure what to make of that (still aren't really).\n\nWhile I look back on these memories with fondness I'm actually fine with it not working like that now. Avoiding these sorts of things until later gives the kid time to be a kid longer and to encounter situations at an appropriate time where they can be more easily contextualized. Also, no nightmares waking me up from a sound sleep.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Parenting","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhn3","subreddit_subscribers":3322470,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I'm 46, I saw Conan The Barbarian, Aliens and Robocop in the theater with my Dad.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/jlukd3\/im_46_i_saw_conan_the_barbarian_aliens_and\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

we're fundraising to send a North American team\nto battle it out, in person\nwith the Europeans\nat the i46 LAN in Telford, England.\nThis is TF2\nInsomnia 46 is open!\nAlright, welcome ladies and gentlemen\nto the i46 LAN\nwe're going to do a quick tour\nof what's going on here\nshow you a little bit\nabout the scope and the grandeur of this event.\nThere's a huge event hall at Telford, England.\nThis is just one half\nof the computer players that we have\nthere's three halls that are about this size\nthis one has all the TF2 players in it\nexcept for a few teams that are\nwith organisations\nthe scope of this LAN is huge\nthere's so many players here,\nabout 2500 players.\nWe also have third hall\nthat is filled with exhibitors,\nsponsors, companies\nthat are giving away products,\nshowing of their products,\nshowing off their technology\nand showing off their games.\nThis LAN is probably\nit is the biggest LAN that we've had for TF2\nwith the American teams coming over\nto the competition\nwe've got more top teams than\nwe've had at the previous event.\nWe never had so many teams here\nthat are like top level teams.\nFor the European scene we've had maybe\nthere's been, let's say 4 or 5 teams\nthat could win the tournament\nand other teams who can cause an upset\nmaybe eliminate 1 or 2 of these teams\nif they're lucky\nIn this one, it's incredibly hard to call\na lot of the teams have stepped\nup their game and ...\nyeah this is the biggest, by far.\nYeah biggest by far\nand I mean it's\ngreat respect to the community themselves\nthat have funded, partly funded\nthe American teams coming over\nand I mean it's great to have them here\nit's been about 4 years in the making\nand finally we have them here\nfinally, whoever will answer the,\nwho is better, North America or Europe\nbut yeah, biggest by far\nand it will hopefully be a great weekend.\nWe're going to take a look at the team that is\npossibly Americas best hope for the tournament\nThey along with the other American team\nare getting ready to play in the\ntournament here at i46.\nSome of them just flew in this morning\nusing plane tickets bought through a\ncommunity fundraiser.\nEveryone wants to see these two\nAmerican teams play in person\nagainst the Europeans for the first time\nwhere lag and ping won't be a deciding factor.\nMy money is on...\nI've got to stick with...\nEpsilon.\nYou can't say Epsilon!\nI'm going to have to stick with Epsilon.\nThey are the most consistent team in Europe\nso what I mean by that is that they\nmay lose games\nbut they also always win others,\nif you understand\neveryone has their own loss as well\nthey have downtime,\nthey haven't practiced,\ngoing out to have parties, whatever\nthat always happens to everyone especially\nin this nice summer weather of England.\nIt's raining a lot but...\nI mean, they always seem to\nput it back together and\ntoday they haven't been beaten so far\nand it's hard to go against that\nsort of performance.\nThey have the skill in the individuals\nas well to just go through the tournament\nit will be interesting to see what the\nsort of American taste of things\nAmerican flavour of things\nwill do to the tournament\nmy money firmly sits with them,\nat the moment.\nWho's going to win the tournament?\nEpsilon, is my pick as well unfortunately\nno I've said that Epsilon are going to be\nthe pick but...\nthe other positions, I honestly\nthink that Classic Mixup...\nif anyone is going to stop Epsilon\nat this tournament\nClassic Mixup are going to be the team\nwho could possibly take it from them\nhowever, LG gaming as well\nI honestly think that this could be an Epsilon\nwinning the grand final with\nClassic Mixup second, LG third\nbut maybe an Infused - TCM battle for\nkind of the 5th place\nyou're right with what you said, Epsilon they...\ntheir gameplay is just so beautiful to watch\nin a kind of romantic way\nwhen one player falls back\nbecause he needs help\nplayers push forward with him\nto try and support him\nhalf of the strategies I don't know\nwho comes up with them...\nSo that means\nif you're going for LG and\nMixup for 2nd and 3rd\nthat means that you think they're\ngoing to face each other\nin the consolation final.\nConsolation final?\nThe winner of that would go to face Epsilon.\nSo you're saying that there will be an\nall American match at some point\nwhich could be interesting.\nMy name is pyyyour, Bradford Ross\nand I am a Medic for Classic Mixup.\nI've probably played the longest out of the crew\nand everyone else is about as long as me\nmaybe TLR started a couple\nseasons later than myself.\nIn terms of the crew\nthere is Enigma, Platinum\nRuwin and myself we're just\nsuperduper friends\nRuwin is like my best e-friend\nwe get along, we're both pretty corky.\nWe're having a lot of fun because\nlike I was saying we trust each other\nwe're skilled,\nso we can count on each other\nand we're all LAN proven which has\nworked out a lot better this LAN\nthan my previous LAN in Dallas, TX.\nMy name is Sven, Ruwin\nI play Team Fortress 2\nI enjoy it\nand I'm glad to be here in Europe,\nit's awesome\nI've known pyyyour, Brad for a long time\nhe is one of the masterminds of the game\nhe really truly understands it,\nunderstands the dynamic behind it\nthere's not a whole lot of people that do\nI try\nbut I guess my brain is not big enough\nI don't think I've ever seen\nBrad rage before\nI mean he gets a little upset\nbut anyone who is really into gaming,\nreally into competition\nwill get upset\nwhether it's a videogame or a sport\nor just anything that\nthey're passionate about\nno I've never seen him go over the top\nor yell or anything ever\nhe'll usually just step back\ntake a breath\npretty level-headed.\nas a team we'll hang out in mumble\npretty much whenever we're online\nso we have that going on for us\nwe like each other, which really helps\nthat's been going for LG for a long time\nthey've all been friends they've\nall enjoyed each other's company\nin terms of my friends online\nthere are those that I can be on a team with\nand not rip my eyeballs out\nthe people that I like talking to\nbecause I have something to learn from them\nor the people that are just really funny\nto just talk to them they make you laugh\nin real life if you have a poopy day\nyou talk to like my friend Lange\nLange will like\nbring you back up in a heartbeat\nwhich is really cool about online\nwe get along on the team and\nhe knows me well\nso whenever I'm getting\na little anxious\nanything with the team\nhe brings me back in\nand then the same thing with Ruwin\nif someone's upset at Ruwin\nI make sure that the situation is ok.\nwe definitely try to hang out\nas much as possible\nplay other games together\nplay, offlclassing\nteambuilding is great\nI guess is what I'm getting at\nif you're going to be playing\na game and it's team based\nmake sure that you know your\nteammates in and out\nand know how to make them\nplay at their best\nThe i46 Team Fortress 2 tournament\nhas teams of six players\ncompeting against each other on maps\nin which the goal is to capture control points.\nMost of these maps feature five control points\nthat must be captured in sequence.\nTeams begin on opposite ends of the map\nand start each round by\ntrying to capture the middle point.\nSix player teams most often use\ntwo Scouts\ntwo Soldiers\none Medic\nand one Demoman\nduring this opening rollout.\nPoints are captured by standing on them.\nMore players result in a faster capture\nand captures can be\nblocked by the opposing team.\nOnce a team has captured the middle point\nthe next point becomes available for capture.\nThe team that lost the\nmiddle point can reclaim it\nbut must simultaniously defend\ntheir second-to-last control point\nwhich captures faster.\nLosing that point opens up\na teams last point for capture.\nWhen a team has\ncaptured all control points\nthe round is over\nand one point is\nrewarded to the winning team.\nThe team to score the most points\nwithin 30 minutes wins the map.\nStarting with the Best-Of-16\nmaps were played\nin a Best-Of-3 format.\nI am Seb Barton\nI live in Plymouth in England\nand I am 19 years old.\nWhy do you play Demoman?\nBecause when I first tried to pick it up\nI heard it was the hardest class\nI wanted a challenge,\nso I've picked it up and tried it\nand I've enjoyed it since.\nI think the Americans have\nwow'd everybody to be honest.\nthey've put in so much more effort\nthey're far more professional\nthan the Europeans\neveryone over here\nthey're more focussed on the\npartying and the drinking really\nand then the Americans have\ncome over they have been practicing\nthey've been talking tactics\nwith each other\nthey've been even asking us\nfor pcw's, scrims\nwe weren't expecting that\nand it shows, the results.\nThey're very aggressive\nreally aggressive,\nthere's no stopping them.\nSometimes the\nEuropeans will like to stop\nbuild uber, talk about\nwhat we think we should do\nwhat had happened last time\nand we like to talk\nthings out mid-game\nAmericans, they're straight in there\nthere's no stopping them,\nthere's no time to think about anything\nyou have to react\nto be able to deal with it\nthey've done a lot better this LAN.\nif one person is pushing in,\nno matter what game you're really playing\nif a person is pushing in and\nyou are in a team\nand they expect something from you\nthey expect you to\nfire in their direction,\nthey expect you to help them\nyou have to help them\nit's on the teams that they\ndon't help each other\nthat you can't pull off\nbeing aggressive\nand putting it all on the line\nwith us, when someone's going in\nthey know that they're going to\nget support from the rest of the team\nand the people giving\nthe support know that\nthat person going in knows that\nit's just a give and take that tends\nto work out because we trust each other.\nI'd say so far the soldiers\nhave surprised me the most\nhere in Europe, I kind of expected\nthem to be a little bit worse\nbut their aim is pretty spot on\nand their positioning is pretty good as well\ntheir scouts have been doing ok\nI haven't played Epsilon yet\nso I can't really say much to that\nin terms of Scouts but,\nhow much experience I have against LG\nClockwork and Cyzer\nthere's really no Scout pair like that\nwith the support of b4nny on any\nother type of team, any other dynamic like that.\nEurope's Team Infused plays Classic Mixup\nin the upper-bracket semi finals.\nThe first map is a disaster\nwith Darn smashing his keyboard\ncrashing his PC and his\nteams momentum in the process.\nThe second map is closer\nbut Classic Mixup take it and move on.\nI was quite drunk.\nand that's a lie, I had a really,\nreally, really easy shot\non Brad, pyyyour.\nI missed it\nand I just went like...\n#$&amp;@!\nand banged the keyboard\nand my PC went...\n\"beep\"\nand that was...\nno, like it wasn't anything serious\nlike really\nas in I just banged the keyboard\nwhat I do daily at home.\nMy name is Mike Miles, Platinum\nof Classic Mixup\nI play Demoman at this LAN\nbut I'm as Soldier at heart.\nSo what's exciting to watch\nabout competitive TF2?\nThe fact that it's such a team based game\nbut it also showcases all\nthe individual skills\nfirst person shooter\nto get like a 6K, in CS\nis standard because it's very easy\nbut in TF2, if you get a 6K that's amazing\nbecause it's such a team based game\nbut it can showcase individual talent\nand I think that's why it's awesome.\nHey I'm Anthony \"Harbleu\" Ballo\nWhat makes it fun to play\ncompetitive TF2 over other games?\nHow well it mixes so many different aspects\nthe strategy involved\nwith the individual skill\nand the team skill is something\nthat you don't see in most of those games.\nyou can play the same map\na hundred times and it'll still be fun\nbecause there's so many\ndifferent things that you can do on it\nI don't know, it's just a\ngreat community to be in\nand the game itself is\njust very fun still, for me.\nWhy is it a good game to shoutcast?\nthe teamplay for one.\nI love the difference of classes\nthe amount of possible\nstrategies there is\nwe as casters don't even know\nand we're watching through spectator mode\nsuddenly a Spy will get a stab\non the medic and we're like...\nwhat's going on,\nwhere did that come from?\nif you haven't seen any TF2 yet\nwatch Highlander\nwatch how crazy that is\nnow that is a game which is crazy,\neverything going on constantly\nand I think aside from that...\njust outside it,\nthe way that TF2 is spoken about\njust outside the game is great\nyou don't usually hear negative\ncomments and there's a good reason for that.\nHey what's going on, I'm Tyrone\nfrom Leviathan Gaming\nmy ingame name is Tyrone backwards\nso enoryt is often what I'm called.\nI'm personally from California\nso I actually had to fly out from Newark\nand then to Birmingham International\nand the flight, I probably traveled about\ntwelve hours, I'm still jetlagged\nnow so I'm kind of losing my mind.\nWe feel like the underdog even\nthough we just won the ESEA LAN and\nall that good stuff\nbecause the new formation of\nMixup and some of the European\nteams we never really played against\nso I feel like everybody\nhas got that common goal\nto just work and prepare for the event\nso I think we're\nfeeling pretty good about that.\nI am clockwork from Leviathan Gaming\nhow do you think the American teams\nare going to stack up against\nthe Europeans in the competition?\nI'm not a hundred percent sure\nlike some people are that we're going to\njust blow their competition out of the water\nwe don't know how they play really\nwe don't know how\nthey play on LAN especially\nEpsilon, when we played\nthem in the showmatch\nthey had a lot of\na lot of cohesion\nI kind of don't think anybody\nexpected them to have\nthey're really good, as a team\nI think we have\nthe capability of becoming first - second\nMixup - LG, LG - Mixup\nbut I'm not sure it's going to happen\nI'd be kind of surprised\nbecause we are kind of,\nin their territory\nthe home crowd, it's got their back\nwouldn't be surprised...\nif Europe comes over the win.\nLeviathan Gaming\nhas got some competition here\nwho is the biggest competition for you?\nI hate always having to talk about them but...\nit would definitely have to be Mixup\nMixup is the dream team\nthe USA superstar team\nso they're going to be...\nthey're going to be a problem\nthen you also have Epsilon\nwhich is the Euro equivalent\nShintaz is supposed to be\nthe craziest Scout I've ever seen\napparently, I haven't seen him play yet\nthat's the word on the street\nI don't know, those two teams are\ngoing to put up a pretty tough fight\nthere's also Infused\nand there's also other teams\nthat I'm not even familiar with\nwho can also give us a run for our money\njust going to be a series of fights I guess.\nlet's see, I'm a 26-year-old grown man\nhailing out of the desert, Phoenix Arizona.\nJust like to play some\nTeam Fortress 2 every once in a while\nwhich means every night\nand so it's got me here\nI'm not even a big videogame\nplayer, aside from TF2\nI used to play Counter-Strike\nback when I was 12 years old\nplayed that for a couple years,\nwas never very good\nguys who I was playing with bought TF2\nthey told me to buy it, I bought it\nand for some reason, I don't know\nI just really enjoyed it.\nI think I just found a couple\ncool people to play with\none of them named Tyrone\nwe kind of started from the bottom\nand somehow we're here now.\nme and Tyrone started out\nwe were awful, we were awful\nand we still are awful\nbut somehow we've made it to the top\nwe just kind of picked up\ngood players on the way\nyou got to say something about teamwork\nTyrone is a great leader\ndoesn't have the best DM\nI'm not very good at aiming\nI'm considered pretty bad\nwe've created this teamwork\nwhere he kind of plays off my plays\nand because we've\nplayed together for so long\nit just ends up working\nand other people who just kind of\npiece themselves together\nthey're good individually\nbut it honestly is a team game, at a point\nthere's different tactics,\nsome teams are really good individually\nsome teams are\nreally good playing as a team\nI think you can do\nwhatever you like in your life\nfor some people that means\nstaying home playing videogames all night\nlooking at you, Cyzer\nother people like to go out and party it up\nI believe you can do\nwhatever makes you happy\nif you want to play games,\nplay games. That's fine.\nWe got the tickets a month\nbefore and we were pumped\nit was such an awesome experience\nit felt a bit surreal\nbecause of gaming\nhey, it's going to take us to Europe\nhow awesome is that?\nMost of us especially haven't been to Europe\nwe're pumped, we were as pumped as can be\nespecially when the tickets\nwere actually purchased\nright then and there, no hassles\nno complaints. It was amazing.\nWhen it comes to online play\nit's not really representative of...\nthe true TF2 experience, especially on LAN\non LAN everybody is at the\nsame location, same pings\nsame machine\nwhat it really comes down to is...\nthe mindset is what's\ngoing to give you games\nthere's no inherent advantages\nMy name is Dante, A.K.A. Shade\nI'm the Medic for Leviathan Gaming.\nLeading up to this event, what were your\ninteractions with the European community\nand your views of their playstyle\nand them as a whole?\nI wasn't really up, on the European play\nit is interesting that they play vanilla\nI found that kind of interesting\nthey sort of like to keep it very\nstraight-laced when it comes to their play\nI do think the American style,\nusing the unlocks\nadds a little bit variety to the gameplay.\nMy name is Grant, known as b4nny\nI play Demoman for LG.\nComing to play against these teams\nthat we've never even heard of\nor players that we've never heard of\nit kind of does make a difference because\nwhen you practice against\na team you get to learn\nyou get to learn their playstyle\nspecifically like each players tendencies\nthe ways they like to approach\ncertain situations\nit's more than learning your\nown team when you practice\nit's learning the other teams too\nyears ago when Complexity\nwas the top team in America\nthey wouldn't practice that much\nso you wouldn't really get to learn\nexactly how to play against them\nand that was something\nthat I think really helped them out\nso it's kind of similar coming here\nplaying against European teams\nyou don't really know\nwhat each player is going to do.\nHow do you like the NA\nteams coming over here\nhas that been a good experience,\nwhat do you think?\nIt's been fantastic\nit's something we've wanted for so long\nmaybe it could have\nhappened when NA wasn't\nat probably it's prime, you know\nmaybe a couple years ago\nwhen we had the edge\noverall it's fantastic isn't it?\nYeah I got to agree it's actually really cool\nin all the LANs I've been too, which is a lot\nthis LAN I've been looking for since\nwe started TF2\nnot just to sell the score\nbetween the Americans\nbut to actually have\nsort of a world thing going\nbetween the best teams really\nand obviously they've come here\nand they're proving it so far.\nIn the double-elimination tournament bracket\nthe American teams remain undefeated\ndispatching the European\nteams to the lower bracket.\nInfused gets knocked out by TCM\nwho in turn get knocked out by Epsilon\nnow the last European\nteam in the tournament.\nClassic Mixup defeats Leviathan Gaming\nin the upper-bracket finals\nto book their place in the grand finals.\nLG plays Epsilon to determine\nwho will face Mixup on the main stage.\nWill Epsilon be the\nEuropean crowd's home team?\nOr will Leviathan Gaming\nmake it an all-American affair?\nclockwork going up the spire right now\nTyrone jumping in\nlooks like together they are\ngoing to force that uber out of epsilon\nclockwork retreating now back to the choke\nthey realize they've got this kritz\nbut they can't use it against invulnerability\nthey are going to go ahead and pop it now though\nb4nny shooting the crit stickies\nbut they miss the combo\ncombo retreats\nactually clockwork has found them in the house\nlooks like he will be trying to take on\nboth a Medic and a Soldier by himself\nthat's going to be GeaR down\nand he chases F2 through\nthe doorway to get the kill\nthe Medic is down for Epsilon\nNow Epsilon looks like\nthey may want to move out here\nthey're going to have to be careful,\nclockwork could go for the Medic pick here\nhe's not going to go for it\nactually, oh my gosh he's just\ngoing to go for the backcap right now\nthis is insane\nhe's been spotted out\na Scout going to try and stop him here\nbut he gets the kill on Shintaz\nclockwork will take the round!\nThe uber is coming in right now\na little bit of an early pop\nI don't know they'll be\nable to bring this one into last\nlooks like they've got a lot of kills\nGeaR and Extremer already down\nShintaz, what the heck just happened?\nShintaz walking back towards spawn\ndecided to take a little bit of a shot\nthere at the Medic,\nand my god did that ever work?\n... Epsilon they've got\na pretty solid defence set up right now\nlooks like Shade is in an\ninteresting position now\nhe's caught next to the point\nI don't think he likes where he is\nhe's actually just going to go\nmaybe for the capture here\nnobody is in time to stop him\nand Shade is going to get the capture\nwinning the round for LG\nthat is ridiculous,\nyou don't see a Medic do that every day.\n... Just actually fading but they're\ngoing to go ahead and take this anyway\nb4nny likes his odds here\ngoing to take down KnOxXx right away\nnot leaving him any room for retreat\nhe's getting pressured\nby the Scouts right now\nconnects one pipe\nagainst the Scout, but this Scout\nprobably going to take him down here\nno, interesting dodging\nand actually,\na pill connected to that Scout's feet\ngoing to take him down, schocky down\nand how did that pill even hit the Medic\ncross-map pipes\ntaking down the Medic\nalong with some help from\nTyrone jumping in to finish things off\nthat is going to be a round for Leviathan Gaming\nlooking so solid here.\nIn a stunning series\nLeviathan Gaming knocks out the last\nand best European team.\nWith Epsilon out of the tournament\nthe grand finals will be Mixup versus LG.\nThe two old American rivals\nwill now fight for the grand prize\non English soil.\nLet's talk about Epsilon a little bit\nhow easy were they to play against,\nwhat was their problem against you?\nThey definitely were not an easy team\nI feel like they were really coordinated\nit was like playing against a moving wall\nluckily with us\nwe have a lot of disruption plays\nour flanks, we worked the flanks really hard\nI think it kind of worked against them,\nthe way they moved\nlike such a unit, you know\nbecause we attacked from all sides\nI feel like we were just a bit more\norganic with our strategies\nthings a little bit more on the fly\nthey play the numbers game\nthey play that all extremely well\nbut we were able to adapt\njust a bit quicker in the fights\nI felt like our communication\nespecially in the two-on-twos, three-on-threes\nwas just a bit better\nI think that's what really edged out the fight\nalthough it was, the first maps were easier\nI feel like it really could have gone either way\nit came down to...\njust great plays\nwe were just catching them\nas soon as they stepped out too far\ndefinitely was a great game\ngreat playing to them\nI guess we just edged them out,\nwe were the better team today.\nI'm TLR, I'm the pocket Soldier for Mixup\nHow is LG?\nBefore LAN, online they weren't playing very well\nTyrone was really struggling\nchanging things up\njust as a team they weren't playing like how they\nhave in the past, really\nsince they've been here,\nthey've been playing really well\nI've watched...\nI don't know if they've lost any games.\nI'm enigma\nI'm playing for Classic Mixup\nI've been playing for them for about\nthree or four seasons\nand I'm the passive Scout.\nHow are you guys going to prepare for\nLeviathan Gaming?\nI think it's more of a mentality thing\nyou want to be in the right mindset\nto beat them\nnot be too afraid of them\nbecause they are intimidating\nthat's where they get most teams\ntheir past history and\npeople being afraid of them\nwe don't want to play into that\nwe want to play our own game against them\nwe're going to prepare by just\na little peptalk\nand a little mental preperation,\nmore than anything.\nWe are competitors, we're huge rivals\nsometimes that can get in the way\nbut as players\nand for what they do for the community\nthey're great guys you know\nit's funny because online\nwe might not get along\nbut in person, we're always like\n\"hey what's going on\"\n\"how was your trip\"\nI mean we have a good\nrelationship outside of the game\nbut ingame\nwe're rivals, we want to beat each other\nnothing more\nthan you know, victory.\njust about to get started with the grand finals\nthe crowd here is super hyped\nsounds like everybody is going to be\nsupporting Leviathan Gaming\nbut either way, it's going to be a great time\nit was a great atmosphere in the last match\nLeviathan Gaming, their match\nto book their place here\nthe Europeans wanted Epsilon to make it\nbut they still gave a nice, hearty\nround of applause for Leviathan Gaming\nonce they booked their spot.\nYou think LG has become the default\nteam to cheer for?\nYeah\nI've been talking\nto loads of the EU guys\nand no one is going to cheer for Mixup\nlike this is,\nMixup versus the crowd\nnot Mixup versus LG\nyou'll see\nyou haven't seen it yet but you'll see\nthey're going to go, just mental.\nWhy do you think they chose LG?\nBasically LG, has been really low key\nand Tyrone has been chatting with everyone\nyou know, winning the crowd for himself.\nDescribe your feelings right now?\n...\nWhen we go live, it's going to be packed\nit's going to be awesome,\nit's going to be amazing\npeople at home are going to be blown away\nit's going to be incredible!\nI would've loved to see Epsilon on the stage\nit would've been EU versus NA\nbut you know,\nthese teams are the best teams out there\nthey deserve it\nit's going to be an amazing match\nno matter what\nthey both have, you know\nthey have experience playing on grand finals\nthey're going to make a show out of it\nit's going to be awesome.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nwelcome back to i46\nit's Team Fortress 2!\nI have to tell you,\nbefore we bring up some celebrities\nI have a little bit of a soft spot for you guys\nand Team Fortress 2 in particular\nbecause everytime we did finals in the past\nthey were always the best.\nAnd one other thing I'd like to mention is this\nyou guys have such an amazing community\nif every game had what you guys put into it\nwe would have so many fantastic games\nbecause you support each other\nyou cry with each other\nyou laugh at each other,\nyou laugh with each other\nyou support each other\nyou put money\ninto teams that bring them here.\nBrilliant!\n... Mixup are going to have an uber\nLG not going to have one to defend this\nSoldier goes in, doesn't make the\nrocketjump up to that top level\nand Heavy has run up to the point\nuber is right on them though,\nMedic might be in trouble\nhe's surrounded by BLU players\nShade running for his life\ntries a crossbow\nto get him some more health\nbut Ruwin takes him down\nand Mixup...\nwe've got players on the point,\nwe've got a Soldier, mackey jumping up\ndoes manage to take down Harbleu on the point\nbut it's still asking a lot of the Soldier\nthey're all dead, and LG...\nare they going to be able\nto defend clockwork?\nNo\nthere it goes, so\nMixup taking this first round\n... There is a Heavy up there as well\nthat's very weak but is getting healed\nRuwin does take down clockwork there\nb4nny jumping up, does get eliminated\narrows coming in from the Medic, of Shade\nTyrone still going to try it\nairshot there by Tyrone,\nTLR taken care of as well\nLG are going to get this surely now\nPlatinum comes in to block, wow\nit doesn't really get much closer than this\nfour minutes remaining\nLG, in the tendency trying to win this round\nScout on top as well,\nHarbleu coming in to block this time\nthey're not giving it up Arx\nb4nny is up, over on the point\nno one up there to block this point\ngreat rounds have been exchanged\nThe two teams sit ten meters apart\non the grand stage,\nseperated by the shoutcasters.\nThe undefeated Classic Mixup pic the first map\nGravelpit\nGravelpit is a unique map\nthat most competitive players don't like.\nMixup chose it because they thought\nLeviathan Gaming didn't practice it.\nBut they're in for a surprise\nMixup take the first round but perpetual\naggression from LG wins them the second.\nThe tiebreaker round is a nailbiter\nbut Mixup barely secure victory, on map one.\nNext, the teams go to LG's favorite map\nGullywash\nthe first round easily goes to LG\nwhen clockwork switches to Sniper\nand gets an incredible\nheadshot on Mixup's medic.\nWith pyyyour down and no ubercharge\nMixup can't defend.\nLG's own Medic, Shade\nsurvives almost the entire game\ngiving his team a significant advantage\nin ubercharge and healing.\nClassic Mixup loses this map, 4 - 2\nThe crowd is ecstatic\nthere is one more map to go\nBadlands\nMixup nearly loses the first round\nbut pyyyour survives\nand ubers his team to win round one\nbut in round two\none false step is all it takes for Mixup\nto lose all their players\nLG wins round two.\nThe next two rounds\nare straight from the TF2-textbook\nShade dies, and LG loses a round\nthen pyyyour dies, and Mixup loses the next\nMixup takes the lead again in round five\nand they even take round six\ndespite Shade's amazing double-kill.\nWith half of the map time remaining\nMixup decide to bring out the big guns.\nEnigma plays the heavyweaponsguy\nthey're trading speed, for defensive power.\nAfter a long fight\nLG finally defeat this strategy\nand bring the score to 4-3.\nThe scores are close\nbut Mixup wins the middle point\nwith two minutes to go\nas the clock ticks down\nLG realise\nthey can't capture points\nfast enough to win the game.\nAfter the closest games of all time\nthe players of Classic Mixup\nbecome the first TF2 world champions.\nHow was that TF2 final?\nAmazing, awesome\ndefinitely the best finals\nwe've had since we got here.\nDo you have a favorite player from that event?\nI think pyyyour, just because I'm a Medic\nso I'm kind of bias towards Medics\nbut he was really really good.\nI think I'll probably be bias as well\nsince I always watch you play Medic\nthat's the one I know most\nI'll go with Medic\neverybody loves b4nny\neveryone cheering from him,\nand he got some amazing pipes off as well\nI think I saw him get like four in a row\nit was just epic.\nFor some reason they wanted\nto root for LG a lot more than us\nwhich was interesting\nso everytime I died, whether it was\na bad death or just a random death\neveryone would go crazy so\nit was kind of funny.\nAnybody has the ability to pick it up\nand play, and have fun.\nSounds like, not true but it's entirely true\nwith map variation you have and nine classes\nand the public service you have,\nfree to play, by Valve\nand making it so tempting with all their cosmetics.\nI think that's the thing that makes it a unique eSport\nit's easy to pick up\nit's funny\nand that's why,\nI've always been saving about TF2\nit's never going to become like Starcraft 2\nnever, like I know it sounds harsh\nbut it won't because it's comedy\na lot of people like seeing solo skill\none-on-one's, all that stuff\nand that's what drives people\nto actually wanting to watch it\nwhen we see an airshot in TF2\nit's like, a huge thing you know\nwhen a Medic does like a sick surf\nor something like that it counts for nothing\nit's just how it is\nyou know, it's good, it's easy to pick up\nwhich is great, and that's why we have\na huge fanbase of it don't we\nwhen it goes to competitive level\nthat's when we struggle\nbecause it's not easy to go into that level\nI think that the hype from the crowd was great\nI've never been in an environment like that\nplaying videogames\ndoing sports has been like that for me\nthe hype from the crowd was really awesome\nit made me want to play well\nwhen I knew,\nthat we were probably going to win\nit felt really good\nI relaxed a little bit\nand I knew that we would get cheered on\nand everyone had a great time.\nAdding to that, I'm glad that we put on a show\nand that's what I've kept saying since...\nsince we first got here and before that\nI just wanted to put on a show\nregardless if we've finished first or fourth.\nI really love watching\nTF2 competitively\nit's a game that combines a lot of\nincreddible stuff from different eSports\nand I've watched other eSports too.\nI've watched a lot of Starcraft especially\nI've gotten my fair share of Quake Live,\nI went to QuakeCon\nthat was pretty awesome.\nThere is ofcourse an increddible\nlevel of individual skill\nthat we like to showcase\nwe love showcasing the huge airshots\nover at eXtv\nwe love showcasing\nthose crazy stealthy Spy backstabs\nand whenever we can\nwe try to get the Medics on camera too\ndoing their stuff.\nIt's tougher, because they don't get the kills\nbut they do increddible positioning\nand if some Soldier is bombing in at them,\ntrying to take a shot or two\nwe've brought Shade,\nand we've brought pyyyour over here\nand everyone was really cheering you know\nwhen pyyyour would die,\nor when Shade would die\npretty much if you're one of the best Medics\nthose are the only situations you ever die\nit's when your entire team's hand is forced.\nAbsolutely love watching TF2\nI think it's the most exiting eSport\nI really hope we get more viewers\nI mean that's what we're trying to do here\nwith this documentary, is tell you guys\nlook, we love it.\nCome join us, join our passion\njoin what we love watching\nwhat we love doing here in TF2.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"discoskyline","subreddit_id":"t5_2l5xsy","subreddit_subscribers":14,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"vquSQD33dmc","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/discoskyline\/comments\/jlum4n\/vqusqd33dmc\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I think I have all the right characteristics. Smart, Funny, Handsome, Charming, Old fashioned, loyal, trustworthy, and pride myself on always being a Gentleman. I cheated on a Girlfriend one time when I was around 16 years old. I kissed another girl, felt so bad right after I ran to girlfriends house and confessed my wrong doing. We are still good friends! I try to be the best man the woman in my life. I try to be apart of their world and hope they want to be apart of mine.

Could be that I am a bit of a troublemaker, I always fully disclose my past before starting anything. My friends always say I'm a bad boy with a heart of gold. Go figure. I guess the one positive is that all the woman I seem to date\/have a relationship with always wind up finding something special shortly there after. I can't be upset with that. I don't exactly have my life together, but I feel a big part of that is the longing to have someone to grow with, share my life with, and make a life with. Sounds like I am not even really sure. So, more about me. I have not been in a relationship with a woman for well over a year. I am 5'11, brown hair, browns eyes, and before the pandemic started was looking pretty fit!

I've had issues with drugs which landed me in rehab in my sophomore year of highschool, and I've had a health condition that at times has seriously affected my quality of life since 15.  My home situation is stable but not ideal, my mom has a prescription drug (benzo) habit and drinks a lot, my dad is a compulsive hoarder and drinks and smokes weed every day. They are both pretty dysfunctional and couldn't be alone in a room for 5 minutes without arguing. Many times I end up harshly criticizing my parents. I don't think its getting through to them and I usually feel bad afterwards (I guess its also not my place).  Food still gets put on the table, they dont beat me or say mean things to me, and they have enabled me to get expensive medical treatment as well as do activities like soccer etc.. They are not bad people, just dysfunctional, but I really do not want to end up anything like them and I hope for their own sakes they change.  I also have a little sister who I am not at all close with.  I feel very little emotional connection to any of my family members and honestly I don't even feel like I desire it (At least not with my parents, they would have to go out of their way to build that with me and not the other way around.). Im going off to college next year and I feel as though it will likely improve my life to not be with my family, but until then I have to figure out a better way to live than what im doing nowadays.\n\nI've made serious improvements in my life from where I was a year ago, I no longer struggle with drugs, I am more happy, My grades in school have improved, I'm a much more open person and have been able to build some strong friendships as a result, I'm seeing steady improvement in my health from an at home physical therapy routine, and I have successfully built a meditation habit. \n\nMy daily routines are pretty erratic though and my mood is still often in the dumps, I watch youtube videos, play games, or otherwise waste time on the internet for 12+ hours a day when i'm alone, I constantly start things and dont finish them, and I really struggle with procrastination. This lack of discipline really really bugs me as I know that I could really do a lot if I just had more self control. I've tried so many times to change my routine though, and have yet to achieve long term success. Sometimes I can start being really productive and limit my less useful habits for 3 days, but I always fall back into it. Its so incredibly frustrating and demoralizing to feel this constant need to numb my brain with stupid gratifying bullshit all-day with the one life I was given.  \n\n   I don't know why I went into so much detail about my life in this post. Maybe I wanted the pity points or something lol. But above all I want to start getting out of my shitty routines, and I want this time to be the last time I make this push. I don't know what that means though, and that's why im posting here.

I am posting here in legal advice because I don't know if I have a case or not.  Firstly, I am in Georgia, this happened in Georgia, and happened when I was in the 10th grade.  I am 18 now and it was entirely innapropriate.\n\nAmong every time I was sexually harassed in my childhood, there was this one that I can remember:\n\nI was in English class with about 30 or so other students - and a teacher.  The guy behind me has been especially annoying.  He had repeatedly kicked my butt with the point of his shoe.  For that, I forget if I even told him to stop.  I felt powerless.\n\nBut there was a day where he started fondling with my back and made several sexual comments: \"Are you gay?  I really want to know\", \"\\_\\_\\_\\_, Are you into guys?\", \"Do you like cock?\" are the ones that I can definitively remember.  It was sexual and unwanted.  Unfortunately, at that age I had difficulties keeping a straight face when I told him to stop, but I told him to stop several times.  Finally, I had enough frustration - I whipped around, yelled a very loud \"stop touching me, \\_\\_\\_!!\" Everyone looked at us.  His friends that were sitting around him while he was touching me knew what happened, and the teacher said \"yeah, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ stop touching \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\".\n\nFrom then on, I didn't do anything, but now that I am 18, I would like to know if anything can be done.  Any thoughts?  When I told him to stop touching me, the line represents a certain slur that I used against him.  Is what I said sexual harassment?  Could he use that against me?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"legaladvice","subreddit_id":"t5_2rawz","subreddit_subscribers":1578547,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Sexually Harassed When I was in High School","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.3,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/legaladvice\/comments\/jlussm\/sexually_harassed_when_i_was_in_high_school\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I\u2019m 39 weeks pregnant, already dilated and effaced (though this could mean nothing) and have been in latent labor for a couple of weeks, aka the baby is due any day. And this past week, my husband got diagnosed with COVID. We have no idea where he would have gotten it, I\u2019ve been quarantined at home for 3 weeks and he just goes to work where he both wears a mask and people he works with get tested. \n\nThankfully I have tested negative for now. But I am 39 weeks pregnant, incredibly uncomfortable, and 35lbs heavier than I was 9 months ago. Hubs and I can\u2019t touch each other or be within 6 feet until the DAY BEFORE MY DUE DATE. You can\u2019t make this stuff up. \n\nSo, if I go into labor, he won\u2019t be there. If I bring the baby home in the next 5 days, he can\u2019t hold it. Not to mention, hubs is isolated in an upstairs bedroom where I bring him sustenance several times a day. So I\u2019m going up and down our stairs a LOT. My legs hurt. I\u2019m exhausted. \n\nI know people have it worse. I am grateful beyond words that my husband isn\u2019t more sick, he\u2019s recovering so well. I\u2019m incredibly happy to not be sick myself. But damn...this is tough. Not to mention the late pregnancy hormones raging or the fact that I am trying to remain as sedentary as possible to try and stave off labor as long as I can. \n\nThis pregnancy has been wonderful, but we keep hitting one speed bump after another. I\u2019m exhausted. It will all be worth it when we get our little one is earth side. But mannnnn. 2020 is something. \n\nHope you mamas have an easier end to your pregnancies than I have.\n\nEDIT: thank you all for the encouragement, kind words, and suggestions. That\u2019s the amazing beauty of an online community.

I'm 20 years old, living with my parents. I work a pretty sucky retail job that makes me dread getting out of bed in the morning, and half of the time I want to never show up again. I know I'm young, I know I haven't spent the last ten years working my ass off... but I have no future at this job. I'm never going to be promoted (not for lack of effort, I actually work really hard and am quite productive), not that I have any interest in doubling my workload for an additional $2 an hour.\n\nIt's officially the time of year that my job actually becomes nearly unbearable due to demand (I fulfill online orders), and I don't think I can keep going. So I want to finally quit and pursue what I've wanted to do since I was 12: art. A notoriously hard profession to be in, I suppose, but the only one I can really see myself being happy with. I want to be freelance, if possible. It's scary and I'm worried my parents will disapprove, because obviously having a consistent income is a pretty smart move, but I want to put my happiness first. I want to quit my job, I want to go back to school, and I want to be my own boss.\n\nSo I think I've decided that I *am* going to quit my job, probably this week, and dedicate all of my time to practicing my craft. I need to make this work, I'm determined. I might also look into starting a YouTube channel as well, maybe to share some drawing stuff, maybe some cooking, maybe even some video games? Or maybe I should learn how to stream? Either way, I'm going to make it someday.\n\nSo I'll put in my two weeks tomorrow and see what happens!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"u_iluvpotions","subreddit_id":"t5_1j7t23","subreddit_subscribers":0,"subreddit_type":"user","suggested_sort":"qa","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I'm going to quit my day job to be an artist","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/u_iluvpotions\/comments\/jlv6xz\/im_going_to_quit_my_day_job_to_be_an_artist\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}
