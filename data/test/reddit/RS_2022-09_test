My few limits are rape, gore and scat\/piss. That said pretty much everything else is good to go, such things would include rough sex, cock worship, big asses, free use, incest, public\/sneaky sex and teasing. Kinks are open though for a lot. \n\nIf you want to do a Critical Role scene then you will be put ahead of the rest since that one is a favourite of mine and rare for others to play. \n\nCritical role scene: this one is for a select few who know about cr but I really want to rp a caleb\/jester scene. I'm open to other character pairings if you want but they have to have an interesting scene. The scene itself for Caleb and jester is pretty open so we can figure out something together that we will like. \n\nMom\/son scenes: these scenes could be as simple as a day with my free use mom or maybe the two of us go to the beach or we are going on a family road trip and dad overpacked the car so theres only one seat left for the two of us. \nThere is one mom\/son scene that I know specifically where you are the queen and I'm the prince of a kingdom. On my birthday you offer me to have any one girl to become mine from a line of girls and I instead pick you. \nIf you know Xev Bellringer I would be up for a rp with her as my mom based around one of her scenes or anything. \n\nPokemon scenes: I would love to rp as a trainer with his very sexy pokemon that he travels with, fights with and fucks with or if you want I can play the male pokemon and you the female trainer. \n\n\nHelltaker: For this we can do it as I am the helltaker and I come down and take care of all the demons in multiple ways. Or we could have it where I am a regular person and I jokingly do a summoning and bring one of them under my control then we can bring others in afterwards. \n\nFive nights at Freddy's: I'm pretty open with this one. Wanting to do a rp where I'm the security guard and have to keep track of the animatronics that try to jump fuck-I mean scare me. Or whatever you might be thinking.\n\nAvatar: This one is much more open and I don't have many concrete ideas with I just kind of want to do a rp with it. You can be pretty much any female and I'll be pretty much any male, although my favourite for you would be korra. \n\nGenie: this is one where it can go either way but I would prefer you being my gorgeous female genie. We can work out the specifics of any rules, the amount of wishes as well as our natural look and modified look if you are into that. \n\nMy Hero Academia: I don't have any specific scenes with this one since it'll vary on who each of us are playing. I'm up for playing most of the males, mineta being a no and bakugo being a no unless the scene is good enough. I'm up for you playing any of the females but I am a bit more partial to Mina, uraraka and mountain lady. \n\nGoblin: this scenario is very open and can vary depending on what you are thinking. Could be in a high fantasy theme where we are an adventuring party or in a modern world with fantasy races. I have some pics for thicc goblins but if you have any I'd love to see them. \n\nThere are many more so send me your ideas and what you want to play or just take one from above that I'm more partial to. You know my limits already. Also I am okay playing here on reddit pm but discord and kik are easier for me so if you want to chat there send me your info. \nI'm a detailed first person roleplayer you can play in any person I just ask for detail in return \n\nMy kik is dante19A and I prefer to rp there but I'm open to an orange envelope.

To clarify I don‚Äôt have any issues with others breastfeeding and I know it‚Äôs normal &amp;natural, however the thought of it is sickening to me specifically. Any time I see breast milk being pumped or poured into a bottle\/bag I gag and feel like my skin is crawling. I have a strong aversion to regular cows milk as well and it has always freaked me out even as a young child. I don‚Äôt have a dairy allergy or anything and I was not breast fed as a baby. (as a baby I was severely neglected and bottle fed other things like formula, juice and soda; that ultimately traumatized me and \/seriously affected my health. Long story short due to the neglect among other things; I was placed in foster care. After I was adopted my adoptive parents forced me to drink milk regularly and it was so sickening to me that I would throw up and cry any time I was forced to drink it.) Im not sure if this aversion to milk is linked to my childhood trauma however it‚Äôs incredibly inconvenient as a FTM. I am 38 weeks &amp; I want to breastfeed my son but I‚Äôm terrified I won‚Äôt be able to. I have been slowly trying to get more comfortable with the idea of it and I want to at the very least try to breastfeed. I think maybe skin to skin contact will make breastfeeding easier for me, and maybe I can just avoid pumping\/ storing my breast milk. Although I‚Äôm worried if my baby doesn‚Äôt latch or it becomes difficult to feed him directly I will have to pump.

Sucking up my cousins fat cock (that‚Äôs another story. Check my old post). I am 30 now I still dress with my own clothes or other panties that I‚Äôve taken from my wife, mother in law, family friend, and coworker. \n\n I was away for work in a hotel in the SF Bay Area, once my meetings were over I went back to my room and started dressing up, I was wearing a bright red VS thong, fishnet pantyhose under my black leather mini skirt, and couldn‚Äôt miss my sparkly pink butt plug. My top was a lace black long sleeve body suit, I started doing my make up for the fist time, bright red lipstick to match my red thong, and a black long wig. I looked amazing big Latina ass long legs however I didn‚Äôt feel all that passable because I have a beard. \n\nI started to post pictures on local SF Reddit forums begging for cock pictures to edge myself, it seemed that the guys really liked my ass, my Kik inbox was filled with request and filled of cocks. I entertained all of them, however there was this guy, (let‚Äôs name him Carlos) that caught my attention, he was nice called me a princess and actually entertained a good conversation. I asked for his cock picture and omg! He was packing a big fat veiny cock, his balls were shaved, he had a dad bod and hairy chest, his pictures made me even more horny, I was drooling all over and my clitty was wet with precum. I wanted him so bad, I told him I was alone at a local hotel, he told me he wanted to come over and spend the night with me. I was nervous and scared to share my location, as I had never meet up with another man other than my cousin. I was afraid to get robbed or beat, since there are a lot of people out there that unfortunately hate our community, but also I was so horny that I really wanted to be with him. I gave in ti my cock craving instinct and gave him the address and room number of the hotel I was in.\n\nHe told me it‚Äôll take him about 30 min to get here, as I was waiting all dressed up for him, those 30min were the longest of my life, I was regretting everything I hid my wallet car keys. Then he sends me a message on Kik saying that he is here, my legs started shaking but my craving for him was stronger I peek trough the peep hole and see a tall Latino brown skin black hair, about 6,3 I was so happy that it was the real Carlos from Kik and I wasn‚Äôt being catfished. I let him in, he had a bottle of wine in his hand, I high him and kiss him on the cheek, he instantly highs me tight and grabs my big ass. He smelled so masculine I felt like such a girl next to him, he offers me a glass of wine as we talk about our day. I tell him this is my first time doing this, and he tells me that this is also his fist time , that he had recently gone trough a break up and my pictures had made him question if he was straight. \n\nWe were on our 3rd glass of Chardonnay I was feeling it, and so was Carlos. We started making out and next thing you know I was pressed against the wall he started to grab my big ass and told me how much he loved that mini skirt on me. I could see the bulge in his pants growing so I get on my knees undo his pants and take his thick veiny uncut cock in my mouth, I feel it grow harder in my mouth, it tasted like pee and smelled like sweat but I loved it. He smelled like a real man, I struggled to take his full cock in my mouth but he kept forcing it in making me gag and my eyes water, ruining my make up.\n\n\nPlease comment and vote if you want me to continue","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"cdstoriesgonewild","subreddit_id":"t5_32z7r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/cdstoriesgonewild","subreddit_subscribers":27973,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"First hook up with Reddit Stud (Dreamüòú) pt 1","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.94,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cdstoriesgonewild\/comments\/x2sujq\/first_hook_up_with_reddit_stud_dream_pt_1\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

So if you expected straight smut, sorry!\n\n**Ideas:**\n\n**Free use**\n\nAs it‚Äôs just you and I in the house. We grew closer and closer to the point we‚Äôre always naked and don‚Äôt care about boundaries. Allowing the other to use us whenever they wanted. Freely offering or asking for sex and it was totally normal to do even if we are busy with something else.\n\n\n**No Boundaries**\n\n(Limited Sex)\nAs a family we have no boundaries, being naked, jerking of, talking about sex. Nothing is off the table and we are more than happy to help eachother out, keeping our feelings away from our actions. Usually buying toys or recommending porn videos to eachother.\n\n\n**Family Bonding**\n\nMe and your father caught you watching us one night, we where a little shocked but didn‚Äôt mind too much. Getting more comfortable being sexually open around our son. Eventually we leave the door wide open and do it all around the house. Inviting you, the son to watch and play with yourself as you watch us.\n\n\n**Sex Casino Mom**\n\nI work at a sex casino, an establishment where the customers bet and fuck all they want. Women walking around filled with cum going to other customers or to clean up. Casually pleasuring the customer as they gamble millions of dollars. \nSince I worked there I was given a room at the hotel to live at with you, and now you‚Äôre earning better money you come and gamble. I‚Äôm more than happy to pleasure any customer including my son or just seeing him around with other women.\n\n\n\n**Come here son, have a go with your mother**\n\nYour father offers my holes for you to use and I‚Äôm happy to help out. He gives tips and pointers, pulling you out and sliding in casually to show you how to thrust and position yourself. Father and son truly bonding over pussy and ass.\n\n\n**Only Fans**\n\n(Limited Sex)\nWe had always been close and open, so when I mention I wanted to try only fans it wasn‚Äôt a shock and you offered to help research and take the pictures and videos. This starting our new business as it starts to boom and we earn huge amounts of money.\n\n\n**Futa**\n\nI have been a proud and open Futa for many years. Always not embarrassed to show my bulge under my jeans or skirt. Having a few Futa friends as it started to become more popular and accepted. I always made sure to answer any questions you had about my cock and life as a Futa.(best mixed with other ideas)\n\n\n**Pop-Star Mom**\n\nI am an extremely popular pop-star (of other music category) and you are my son. I am heavily sexualised, wearing crazy outfits and filming borderline soft core porn as my music videos. I go on tour and perform infront of thousands.\n\n\n**Super Mom**\n\nI am a super hero(I have many powers in mind but you can choose one for me of you‚Äôd prefer) I am the peek of super-humans and I fight to defend against villains most days. Usually doing press and marketing stuff rather than fighting. \n\n\n**Shapeshifter Mom**\n\nSome humans posses the ability to change their face and body at will to anyone they‚Äôve seen before. Able to turn into anything human or not. I am one of these people. Rarely using my power as the government keeps tracks on me for obvious reasons, but every now and then I feel like changing to someone else as a break from myself.\n\n\n**Crime Family**\n\nSince your father died, I took over the family business. Handing drugs and dealing with politicians, I earned millions every day for my gang and I made sure to spend it like crazy as well. You‚Äôre my son that I plan to give the business to when I retire or I believe you can do a better job then me.\n\n\n**Monstergirl Mommy**\n\nI am a monster girl and your father was human. Resulting in you turning out human or mostly human. This role goes best mixed with another. For the monster I am. I can play any monster girl or monster. Please send what monster you want me to play ideally without a reference or two!\n\n\n**Succubus Mom**\n\nI am a succubus, I eat and sleep like any human. But to survive I need sexual attention and activity. So as your mother I would require attention and ‚Äòdonations‚Äô to keep me fed. \n\n\n**Mommys a little crazy**\n\nI would play as a demonic worshiper. Being crazy and aloof, spending most of my time doing all sorts of rituals and spells to please my satanic gods. Usually asking you for help in collecting stuff for the rituals or participating directly.\n\n\n**Drunk Mom**\n\nSince your father left us or died. I had turned to alcohol to help me cope. Causing me to be drunk most of the time and very groggy in the mornings. My constant wine drinking would cause mood swings between cute, way to open, flirty, playful, dancing, and every over mood.\n\n\n**Custom**\n\nFeel free to bring your own changes and ideas. I don‚Äôt like to follow the prompts I have exactly and am always looking for new things to add or change!\n\n\nReferences: \n\nI have loads of refs so please describe if you have a preferred body type, hair colour or style or anything. They‚Äôre all drawn refs.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nI don‚Äôt mind playing many characters but not all at once, I‚Äôd LOVE someone happy or willing to play multiple characters too! Priority will go to those willing to play as the son and the father!\n\nPlease be literate and detailed as I will just block you if I do not feel like you are detailed enough.\n\nI have no limits at all! But I prefer to keep things not gross haha.\nAll characters 18+ I have many refs for my character and I would like you to bring a few of your own.\n\nI‚Äôd like this to be as relaxed and chilled as possible haha\n_____________________________________\n\nPlease send more then hi or hey, I‚Äôd like to be told everything about your ideas and experience and style. The more I get told the more likely I‚Äôll roleplay with you!\n\nOr just send me a good ass starter and I won‚Äôt be able to hold myself back.\n\nKik - Charl.rp\n\nDo NOT message me on Reddit, kik only.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"KikRoleplay","subreddit_id":"t5_3g4xs","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/KikRoleplay","subreddit_subscribers":26680,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[F4M] - Unique Mother and son prompts!

Father and son truly bonding over pussy and ass.\n\n\n**Only Fans**\n\n(Limited Sex)\nWe had always been close and open, so when I mention I wanted to try only fans it wasn‚Äôt a shock and you offered to help research and take the pictures and videos. This starting our new business as it starts to boom and we earn huge amounts of money.\n\n\n**Futa**\n\nI have been a proud and open Futa for many years. Always not embarrassed to show my bulge under my jeans or skirt. Having a few Futa friends as it started to become more popular and accepted. I always made sure to answer any questions you had about my cock and life as a Futa.(best mixed with other ideas)\n\n\n**Pop-Star Mom**\n\nI am an extremely popular pop-star (of other music category) and you are my son. I am heavily sexualised, wearing crazy outfits and filming borderline soft core porn as my music videos. I go on tour and perform infront of thousands.\n\n\n**Super Mom**\n\nI am a super hero(I have many powers in mind but you can choose one for me of you‚Äôd prefer) I am the peek of super-humans and I fight to defend against villains most days. Usually doing press and marketing stuff rather than fighting. \n\n\n**Shapeshifter Mom**\n\nSome humans posses the ability to change their face and body at will to anyone they‚Äôve seen before. Able to turn into anything human or not. I am one of these people. Rarely using my power as the government keeps tracks on me for obvious reasons, but every now and then I feel like changing to someone else as a break from myself.\n\n\n**Crime Family**\n\nSince your father died, I took over the family business. Handing drugs and dealing with politicians, I earned millions every day for my gang and I made sure to spend it like crazy as well. You‚Äôre my son that I plan to give the business to when I retire or I believe you can do a better job then me.\n\n\n**Monstergirl Mommy**\n\nI am a monster girl and your father was human. Resulting in you turning out human or mostly human. This role goes best mixed with another. For the monster I am. I can play any monster girl or monster. Please send what monster you want me to play ideally without a reference or two!\n\n\n**Succubus Mom**\n\nI am a succubus, I eat and sleep like any human. But to survive I need sexual attention and activity. So as your mother I would require attention and ‚Äòdonations‚Äô to keep me fed. \n\n\n**Mommys a little crazy**\n\nI would play as a demonic worshiper. Being crazy and aloof, spending most of my time doing all sorts of rituals and spells to please my satanic gods. Usually asking you for help in collecting stuff for the rituals or participating directly.\n\n\n**Drunk Mom**\n\nSince your father left us or died. I had turned to alcohol to help me cope. Causing me to be drunk most of the time and very groggy in the mornings. My constant wine drinking would cause mood swings between cute, way to open, flirty, playful, dancing, and every over mood.\n\n\n**Custom**\n\nFeel free to bring your own changes and ideas. I don‚Äôt like to follow the prompts I have exactly and am always looking for new things to add or change!\n\n\nReferences: \n\nI have loads of refs so please describe if you have a preferred body type, hair colour or style or anything. They‚Äôre all drawn refs.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nI don‚Äôt mind playing many characters but not all at once, I‚Äôd LOVE someone happy or willing to play multiple characters too! Priority will go to those willing to play as the son and the father!\n\nPlease be literate and detailed as I will just block you if I do not feel like you are detailed enough.\n\nI have no limits at all! But I prefer to keep things not gross haha.\nAll characters 18+ I have many refs for my character and I would like you to bring a few of your own.\n\nI‚Äôd like this to be as relaxed and chilled as possible haha\n_____________________________________\n\nPlease send more then hi or hey, I‚Äôd like to be told everything about your ideas and experience and style. The more I get told the more likely I‚Äôll roleplay with you!\n\nOr just send me a good ass starter and I won‚Äôt be able to hold myself back.\n\nKik - Charl.rp\n\nDo NOT message me on Reddit, kik only.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DirtyKIKRoleplay","subreddit_id":"t5_3kem5","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/DirtyKIKRoleplay","subreddit_subscribers":60753,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[F4M] - Unique Mother and son prompts!

This is going to be very short and to the point (and completely edited from last time because woo boo have the rules on this sub reddit changed and I honestly don't get it but whatever.) Anyway, I'm coming off of a pretty bad thing of burnout and just all around mental health issues and I'm craving writing. I love rp'ing - I've been doing it since I was a wee lass. So I want to try and pick that up again if possible. I do need to give a warning that I am *incredibly* picky. It's not personal, I've just been doing this for so damn long that I know what I want and if the vibes don't vibe then it's a no go.\n\n**ABOUT ME:**  \n\\- My name is Katy. I'm 30. I have been rp'ing for I think 17 years at this point text wise and do in person ttrpgs for the past 6. I know what I'm doing, thanks!  \n\\- Because of this, I want all my partners to be 21+. Preferably 25+.- I roleplay in third person, past tense. No other options for me, sorry. I also do prefer to use face claims when it comes to our characters - and real life ones at that. No anime, no drawings. We totally do not have to use them at all, I just like having an idea of what your OC looks like in my mind. But feel free to describe away through our prose - that's fine too. Just know the likelihood of me using one is high.  \n\\- Addendum to the above - I'm not gonna play a face claim you come to me to play. Sorry, but no. I'm not here to fulfill your kinks and crushes. I might ask for a final say when I narrow it down but besides that, nah. I also won't come to you with a face claim to play. That's not my style. It's *your* OC, not mine.  \n\\- I don't tend to describe myself as Advanced Lit any longer - since I sort of left that behind on gaia forums and such - but I do know how to write. I know how to write well. I prefer well written, descriptive, novella style posts that range anywhere in the 2 - 3 paragraph range. That being said, if we are in the middle of dialogue and rapid firing then sure we can go shorter. If we are doing intros or really chewing the scenery then let's go longer. I don't want this rp to be a chore, especially since I'm coming off of bad burnout. Let's be chill - talk ooc if we want, have fun plotting and planning and talking about our OCs. Don't rush me to post and I won't rush you. I tend to say that after a week and a half with no word, I'll move on. I'm very ghost friendly. This is a hobby - I literally do not care. I will warn you that if I really like a rp I will post quickly. I WFH so I'm usually around my phone or computer. I can post daily multiple times but please do not feel like you have to as wel!.  \n\\- Limits for me are eh. I don't like bathroom stuff and harm to children\/minors is a big no no for me (you can talk about abuse in a characters past in passing but please no harsh details). I'm pretty okay with most taboo things. That being said, if you have things that are no nos for you, please tell me so I can abide by them. And if you plan on bringing in some kink that we haven't talked about, please run it by me first. I would like to be prepared. I enjoy ERP, I enjoy adult situations and they're really fun for me! But I also want plot. I want things that will inspire me to keep writing. I can only handle writing sex so much before I nope out of there.  \n\\- At the moment I'm wanting to play a female character. That's just how it is. I get in moods and that's where I'm at right now. I also don't double - I truly do not see the point. I love wide ranges of NPC casts and such and including them in our stories, as well as building the world around us. But right now I really just wanna focus on our mains.  \n\\- I rp through discord servers that either you or I will set up, email, or GDocs (if you are willing to teach me because I've never done it before and would love to learn). Please do not contact me through reddit chat as I have it turned off. The best way would be to contact me through a message here and we can go over some things and then head off from there!\n\n**RPS I WANT**\\- (these are all things i'm craving so feel free to pick any of them. i am very indecisive so have it narrowed down to a couple of options please)  \n\\- Something ala Spy x Family (I like the idea of a spy and an assassin having to work together. Even elements of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Also fake marriage is a god tier trope)  \n\\- Soulmates reuniting years after being pushed apart for whatever reason (this can be literally anything we want to go with and can be set in nearly any era. i have an idea for a couple in an arranged marriage that love each other, but married young, and then the man goes to war for like 5-10 years so the woman wonders if he would move on\/or forget her by the time he gets back but it leads to them having to relearn each other)  \n\\- Dark drama of affairs (Maybe two people whose families are close start having an affair. Maybe it's a one night stand that turns into more when they realize their kids go to school together. This can  \n\\- Criminals on the run (southern gothic, desert vibes, killing others to keep each other alive, all that good tropey stuff)  \n\\- I have a shameless love for the pious priest caught up in his lust for someone in his congregation. I like the idea of it being a sex worker - someone looking to him for help. But this can be anything really.  \n\\- I am really craving some classic gothic vampire horror. Think Castlevania or Van Helsing. The idea of an *innocent maiden* getting stuck in the vampire's lair but not being innocent at all. I don't know - we'd have to plot it out.  \n\\- If you've seen the Kdrama Tomorrow then I want something like that. Grim reapers work together but don't realize that they have a pull toward each other because one of them did an unspeakable sin in their past life.  \n\\- Slice of life and Fantasy pairings\/settings are fine with me. Just come to me with ideas. The worst that's gonna happen is I'm gonna say no!  \n\\- I'm currently obsessed with Eddie x Chrissy from Stranger things. I don't want a Stranger Things rp because I don't do fandom rps, but I would *love* that pairing. Weird guy from the wrong side of the tracks and the perfect cheerleader princess who's actually falling apart at the seams. It's pretty SoL but we can add our own things, yeah?\n\nGonna include a sample here below since that's apparently a thing you do now.**SAMPLE:**\n\n&gt;!While the comment about Dr. King's husband caught her off guard, she couldn't help but laugh a bit. Especially given the confidence Dr. Finn delivered it. She was sure she'd never heard anything about Dr. King's husband, not when the conversation was typically about herself and her own life and relationships. It was interesting, in a way, to get some sort of insight into the woman she spilled her thoughts to biweekly. It made her seem much more regular, at least to Rose. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Her mind was pulled away from her usual doctor though when the subject was once more switched back to her. She could only sigh, figuring that she had to make an attempt to keep the appointment as normal as possible. This outlier was sure to stick in her head for the rest of the week - the least she could do was attempt to deal with it head-on in the present. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!She took him in slowly, noticing how he seemed to appreciate the fact that she was as equally prepared. The last thing she wanted was this appointment to be a waste, so she looked down at her notepad, eyes scanning the words she'd jotted down through the week. It was definitely her version of a security blanket, something that she gravitated toward when she felt her world becoming too overwhelming. Jotting down her thoughts at the moment seemed to ground her, even if she would look back on them hours later and not understand a damn thing she'd written. While she still couldn't feel the usual air of comfort she felt with Dr. King, she nodded and flipped a few pages in her notebook. She shifted and bent her legs underneath her, getting as comfortable as she could in the chair. \"First off,\" she began, eyes rising to meet his again, \"I'm not agitated.\" Maybe it wasn't exactly the truth, but he didn't have to know that.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!‚ÄúMy week was normal, I guess. Slow, for the most part. I spent a lot of time trying to convince people to volunteer in the reading program‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off for a moment, remembering how frustrating the last week had been. It had all crashed down on her in waves that she‚Äôd struggled to cope with. She kept her face turned down, staring at the notebook perched on her lap while she thought through the week she‚Äôd had. ‚ÄúI had a little bit of a breakdown in my office.‚Äù Dr. King had told her that it happened, even while trying to feel better. But she still didn‚Äôt like the way it felt, and she liked telling it to a stranger even less. ‚ÄúI had to go home early.‚Äù!&lt;","send_replies":false,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AdvancedLiterateRP","subreddit_id":"t5_p7a4j","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AdvancedLiterateRP","subreddit_subscribers":6460,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Craving Roleplays [F f A playing M]","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AdvancedLiterateRP\/comments\/x2szub\/craving_roleplays_f_f_a_playing_m\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I'm 60 and started running seriously back in February. I ramped up slowly and got to the point this month where I was now easily doing 4 to 5k runs 3 to 4 times a week. My numbers like RHR dropped to the high 40 's, low 50's. I was happy with my progress. A few weeks ago during a routine visit to my doctor, he sent me for an EKG just to make sure everything was happy with my heart, and said he was going to drop a beta blocker I had been taking for years. It's called Bisoprolol. With all your healthy lifestyle changes, I don't think you need to keep taking this. He sent me for another EKG 2 weeks later and said that he was satisfied with my new heart vitals.\n\n With the first EKG, he thought my heart rate was too low. My RHR has now climbed about 10 beats a minute, so now high 50's.. My HRV has also tanked from mid 40's to low 30's. Garmin keeps saying you're stressed, you're stressed to the point that even when I took several days away from running, it still says I'm stressed. Just sitting in a chair, with a heart rate of 72 and Garmin is tacking on recovery time because stress is supposedly sapping all my energy. \n\nI also have an Oura and it also has detected a drop in HRV and a rise in RHR. It also keeps saying recovery recovery recovery. I'm thinking all this has to be happening because I no longer have an artificially low HR and that the rise is skewing all of my data? I'm just wondering if anyone else has gone through a similar experience and if or when Garmin and Oura realize that this is the new norm and chill out.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"GarminWatches","subreddit_id":"t5_3yt9w9","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/GarminWatches","subreddit_subscribers":9559,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Change in Medication routine and Garmin goes insane?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GarminWatches\/comments\/x2t0vx\/change_in_medication_routine_and_garmin_goes\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Seems safer) to manage stress. I'd say biologically I absolutely do not have the alcoholic gene or I'd be dead by now, but I do have a mental health and drinking\/porn problem. I'm not able to manage those feelings \"sober\", it seems. Anyway I drank 20-25\/week for about 5 years, then progressed up to 55 in 2020 for 6 months, and have slowly brought it back down to 25-30 this year. Last week I drank 30\n.\n\n\nI'm here again because I struggle to believe anything I say. I just can't seem to stick with anything. This week my goal is to a) Stick with mostly light beer (I allow myself the first one to be IPA or similar), try to keep it every other day, and just 28 and keep dropping.\n.\n\n\nAlso my insomnia and general mental health has been way off (that's the main reason I've allowed myself to drink lately, it's really nice having 2-3 hours of drinking beer, watching movies to look forward too) so I'm just kind of hanging on. I feel all these crazy highs and lows and don't see them coming, it's really disconcerting. I like having the \"stability\"\/consistency that alcohol offers.\n.\n\n\nBut I know it's very tenuous at best, and if I'm really going to become mentally strong the alcohol has got to go.\n.\n\n\nI just feel like if I let go of the thing holding me together I'm not sure how I'll make it. Maybe if I make a ritual of having chamomile tea, and good book, and splurging on at least semi-healthy food in the evenings instead. Even then that anhedonia ü§Æ\n.\n\n\nAnyway thanks for reading.

At times I seriously wonder what he sees in me; sometimes I suspect he's only after sex (which I'm weirdly okay with because I'm pretty inexperienced but I'm feeling some type of way and really want it). When he tells me I'm pretty or hot I just...don't really believe it but I still think he's sweet for trying. I'm not pretty in the face either...I can't imagine what my face must look like during sex; I cringe when I think about it.\n\nAnyway, sex is looking like a real possibility soon but I'm *so* self-conscious about my body. I'm a brown girl. I have hyperpigmentation on my inner thighs and genitals (they're really dark). My skin scars really easily...like I have mosquito bite scars from 2016 type skin going on here. I have a roll of fat and it's exaggerated by my bra (the bra bulge is real). My arms are jiggly and so are my thighs. My belly has a very pronounced pouch. My thighs have stretch marks all over them. All I keep thinking about is this really fit, thin guy grabbing at all my squishy parts and him being disgusted by it, by me and all these flaws.\n\nI really like him, I'm really attracted to him, and want to be able to have good sex with him but like, my body is getting in the way. Like, I haven't been good at getting into rhythm, don't have much bj experience, pretty inexperienced all around except for a handful of times. Should I just blow him off if I have this much self-doubt? WTF do I do?\n\nI‚Äôm trying to be more comfortable with my sexuality, but my very few encounters have really got me in my head and just feeling embarrassed and awkward. I‚Äôm just worried I‚Äôll be the worst this guy has ever had and it‚Äôs eating at me.\n\nAlso, how do you move your hips during missionary and doggy style?

While I am in decent shape I know some women do not like short men and that's cool, we all have our preferences. Just wanted to throw that out there, so if you don't mind that then keep on reading.\n\nA little about vanilla me is that I enjoy exercising, hiking, cooking, wine, watching movies and anime, and leathercraft.\n\nOn the kink side, I am a Dom and am interested in training, setting rules and tasks, rewards and punishments, outfit control, collaring, bondage, praise, spanking, slapping, choking, hair pulling, throat fuck, rough play, public play (I don't want to get caught though lol), anal, feet. Even if there is something I did not list, I am willing to try as long as it is not in my hard limits. My hard limits are scat, diapers, blood, knife play, permanent damage to your body. I have a sadist side, but this is something that I only want to do during scenes or play. Most of the time I like to be silly and joke around. I am caring, supportive, encouraging, and I truly believe I am a good listener. I really like praising if someone is being a good girl. I could be your hype man and #1 fan, but will remind you I am still in charge. Essentially, I am very attracted to the caregiver and nurturing side of ddgl outside of play, but have sadist tendencies during play, if that makes sense? Of course, aftercare and safewords are very important for me and hope that any potential sub would also take this seriously.\n\nI am looking for a girl who is obedient and wants to serve. Of course I know that I will first have to earn your obedience and submission. I do not expect nor want you to start calling me daddy\/master\/whatever after 3 messages.

Well, I stopped a few weeks ago when things were heating up with the job hunt, and now that I'm in the company, they required a drug screening. Well, I had the drug screening today (2:15 PM). I had some at home tests, and they were all coming back positive until I drank this detox drink plus a ton of water, then they started showing up negative (around 1:45 PM). Thrilled, I went to the screening site (Around 2:05 PM), and gave my urine sample (around 2:15 PM). When I came back home (around 2:45 PM), I thought all was good. I decided to use my last drug test just to see whether or not my urine concentration was still showing up negative.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt wasn't.

I didn't want to straight up admit to my manager that I smoked weed, so I gave him heads up a few days ago that I \"used CBD oil\" a few weeks back and that stuff may contain traces of THC, and he told me \"I wouldn't worry about it\" and to send him the product so he could let them know if they ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a b s o l u t e l y fucking ridiculous that I have to sweat over fucking WEED of all things!

She's smart, pretty, loving, caring, sweet and kind person. She amazing only a year older than me as well. We've got a good friendship and I'm always happy to go swimming to see her there by her locker waiting for me. \n\nThe problem is I can't ask her out. I know a lot of people would say \"you're young\" or \"you shouldn't worry about this stuff\" I know that. I also know this will go on to the future. It breaks my heart to know if someone asked me to marry them I'd start crying and say no as well as apologising a thousand times. When I was in primary me and this girl (call her Cat) were friends. Cat then started to get more abusive and controlling.\n\nShe sa me mutuiplute time while I tried protecting myself. I told her many times to stop and she'd ignore me. We would have an argument everyday she'd say \"you're a massive bitch you know, no wonder nobody likes you\" or \"you're being sensitive shut the fuck up.\" She had hit me a couple of times if I didn't do anything she wanted me to do. She even started bannging and screaming at the bathroom stall I was in all because I got changed in the bathroom instead of the changing room. If I mentioned an argument to short out she ignored me or yelled at me. She even sexualized me and made disgusting and horrible jokes of me. Because of this I started have nightmares or flashbacks of it and it would feel so real. I could re feel it in a way. \n\nAfter that she went to a different school I had new friends and was okay. One friend completely triggered me. They no stop vent to me and wouldn't let me speak. I felt so used. Nothing but a doll to beat over and over. People started to forget I had feelings. After this I told them I wouldn't be friends with them they had a full tantrum over it. I had to this 3 times. I got scared. I am scared. I feel like I can't speak. A recent event happened to me. I was at a lake and got sa. He kept saying I was pretty and that he loved me. I felt uncomfortable I didn't know what to do. What happened if I said no? I was frightened he would hurt me. He hugged me mutuiplute times and was trying to kiss me. He managed to touch me somewhere. I feel upset and angry. I hate myself. I feel like its my fault. Like I'm the problem right? I got told I'm the problem. \n\nI hate my life. I should have ended it instead of crying. I hate myself. I'm the problem. Everyone must hate me. Why did this happen to me? What did I do? What have I done wrong? I don't know. I'm scared to ask her out. What happens if she hurts me? What happened if she hates me? What happens if she didn't listen to me when I say no or stop? I hate this, my life, myself and what little confidence I have in myself. My problems have been left to rot. Those people have done more than that as well. Expect for they guy I've said everything what he's done and I'll hopefully never see him again.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"venting","subreddit_id":"t5_2sdi7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/venting","subreddit_subscribers":77190,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I can't have a relationship because of other people.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.99,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/venting\/comments\/x2tpdi\/i_cant_have_a_relationship_because_of_other_people\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}

Thanks for clicking‚ÄîI‚Äôve organized this into sections for your convenience and (if you‚Äôre a total freak like me) pleasure.\n\n**Who am I?**\n\nI‚Äôm an enthusiastically nerdy person. I have four separate ongoing DnD campaigns, I truly love games of all sorts, and I am a successful scientist. These are unavoidably significant portions of my identity.\n\nPhysically, I am very much on the end of the bell curve in most ways. I'm 6' 6\" and 250 lbs., and in pretty good shape (as long as you don't mind a little squishiness in the midsection). The kind of thick that gets stuck in doorways and has a reeeeeally hard time finding pants that fit thighs and calves. Seriously, don't message me unless you're cool with extra inches in every way. Very strong, tattoos, full beard, *some* hair (I'm 32, lets be realistic here).\n\n**Who am I looking for?**\n\nIdeally, you are: open-minded, enthusiastic, kind, and emotionally mature (whatever that means to you). You have a good sense of style and an *excellent* sense of humor. You are physically active, and I choose that word specifically because I think ‚Äúfit‚Äù conflates bodyshape and physical fitness. I‚Äôm a very active person, and I would expect my partner to be too.\n\nPhysically, you should be shorter than me (which eliminates basically nobody üòÇ), and curvy. But, and I cannot stress this enough **I can be attracted to any shape, any size, given the right combination of other attractors**. If you‚Äôre petite, message me. If you‚Äôre thicc, message me. If you‚Äôre a trans-dimensional eldritch temptress who wants to fall in love, please fucking message me right now, I have questions. I am very picky, but your shot deserves to be‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶shot. So shoot!\n\n**What am I looking for?**\n\nNothing strictly platonic or strictly sexual. I need emotional connection, mutual attraction, sexual chemistry, and more. If you aren't interested in pursuing that, I don't believe we'll get very far.\n\nAlso, location isn't an issue for me--I travel frequently and I'm more than happy to discuss regular visits if things go that way (and I hope they do!)\n\n**Some potential topics of discussion, should you choose to message me:**\n\n* My interests (video games, board games, 3D printing, political reform, sex &amp; sex culture)\n* Your interests (hot takes included and encouraged!)\n* The weather (actually let me save you the hassle: the weather is a constant reminder of how we've poisoned the planet. Okay wait, maybe don't talk about the weather.)\n* This totally sick model of the Space Shuttle Discovery I just built, and the rapidly vanishing space in my office with which to display it. üòÖ\n* How totally horny you are for bulleted lists.
