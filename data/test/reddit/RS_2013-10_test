I had almost no desire to take the driving test for a car because in my state, you can&amp;#39;t have passengers for the first year, so I might as well just keep using my 70mpg bike and wait until I&amp;#39;m 18 when I can drive a car without restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a reservation at 9AM to take the test.

The website says that the quick stop is done by accelerating to 20mph, then braking quickly when told to. The instructor told me to floor the accelerator and that she would tell me when to stop quickly. I asked her if she was sure, because my mom&amp;#39;s car, which I was using, has a 5.0 V8. She said yes, and to go, so I floored it. By the time she managed to scream stop we were doing 40. I hit the brakes hard so we didn&amp;#39;t run out of pavement, and the tires locked at the very end of the stop. The car has ABS but the tires still locked. Failed that part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next part was backing into a parking space. Did that no problem. She told me to pull out to the right and then told me to stop. She wanted me to parallel park in some cones a good five or six feet to the right of us. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe she didn&amp;#39;t tell me I was going to have to do this beforehand, so I could have properly positioned myself for it. I backed in, straighten up going forward, and was about to shift into reverse for the final bit to make it right and she said that I only get two maneuvers and that I failed that part as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next thing is on the road. Normal 2 lane divided highway for about 2 miles and then some side streets and intersections. No problem, right? I made sure to over-thoroughly check my blind spots when changing lanes because I heard that this was something they could count you off for. Toward the end of the test she told me to take a u-turn at an intersection. I thought I nailed the whole actual driving part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got back and she asked me how I thought I did. I told her that I know I messed up at the beginning but I thought I did decent the rest of the way. Apparently I got marked off a ton while driving on the road for not relying heavily enough on my mirrors and turning my head and looking too much....... also the u-turn she told me to do was supposed to be a 3-point-turn and not a u-turn.

He was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good-looking, though, so when I reactivated my account recently I decided it was finally time to give him a shot. I was taken by surprise our first date by his honesty and openness. He was just as attractive in person as he was in his photos, and he absolutely radiated with a kind of warmth and affection I had never seen before. There were sparks flying everywhere. We went for a ridiculously romantic walk in a nearby park and kissed as the sun was setting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite a big potential hitch on the second date (I decided to go home at the end of our second date and smoke weed with him, but got way too high and had a moderately serious freakout), it was obvious we were both really into each other. We talked for hours, constantly, about everything, and had a natural comfort around each other that took me months to build with others in previous relationships. He touched me in a way that made me want him, badly; when you&amp;#39;re as driven by touch and affection as I am, it&amp;#39;s like a secret language, and his touch was simultaneously sweetly affectionate and desiring. There was a lot of buildup around our having sex because it&amp;#39;d been a while since I&amp;#39;d had emotionally significant sex and I already liked him way too much than I thought was good for me, so the proposition was kind of scary, but on Sunday I went over to his place and our conversation on his bed segwayed into sex without a whole lot of fuss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t that great, sadly. While I already knew he was an amazing kisser and knew how to touch me in a way that turned me on and gave me all kinds of warm fuzzies, he was just not great at the mechanical aspects of sex. Too impatient, too rough, too uncoordinated, and didn&amp;#39;t last long. His penis was so big it was almost painful, and he hit my cervix a bunch of times. Sex was over once he was finished. I&amp;#39;m not difficult to please; I can climax in all the &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; ways (oral, manual, and penetration), I&amp;#39;ve climaxed my first time with new partners, and there have been men I&amp;#39;ve been multiorgasmic, or climaxed 10+ times, with. All it takes is a little bit of skill, gentleness, or patience, but sadly he didn&amp;#39;t really have any of these things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made sure he enjoyed what I was doing, at least. After the act, he talked a lot about what constitutes &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; sex and seemed to be under the impression that ours was a lot better than how I experienced it and I didn&amp;#39;t have the heart to break it to him. Which is odd, because although I came close, I obviously didn&amp;#39;t climax, fake climaxing, and didn&amp;#39;t lie about it when he asked. During some post-coital cuddle talk, it came out that he wasn&amp;#39;t really into the idea of being in a relationship, which I can&amp;#39;t really fault him for seeing as how he was in one on and off for six years which ended with her leaving him for another man. I slept over and we had sex again the following morning, which was even shorter and just as unsatisfying for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...So kind of a bummer ending.&lt;/strong&gt; Although I very much enjoy this gentleman&amp;#39;s conversation and company, have wicked chemistry with him, am super attracted to him and etc., it looks like nothing much is going to work with him, either as a casual lover or in terms of a relationship.

I lost the weight and I want to bulk up!","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhx4","author":"[deleted]","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1njka5/what_now_i_lost_the_weight_and_i_want_to_bulk_up/","is_self":true,"selftext":"Hello /r/fitness\n\nFirst off the helpful info,  I am 32 years old, as of this morning I weight 169 pounds I am 5'11\" and male.  I used to smoke 2 years ago and quit cold turkey.  I have a Membership to a Gym (La Fitness) and go 3x a week and commute to work 5x a week for a round trip of 14 miles and also ride 2 times a week between 30-45 miles and alternate once a week with mountain biking for about 15 miles.  I have been trying to loose weight to look good for my wedding coming up in April and for the last few months with regular exercise and cycling I have all but accomplished that goal in the last 7 months. \n\nMy diet currently consists of a few things, in the mornings I eat carbs an hour before my commute to work for the needed energy (I'm averaging around 16 mph) which usually consists of a bagel and some sort of fruit when I'm at work after the ride.  For lunch its usually one of those smart one's frozen dinners and a protein shake.  Dinner is usually more carbs or sushi (salmon).  \n\nI dropped 30 pounds, so now I'm to that second part, gaining muscle mass.  My main problem as I've been told at this point is my diet, I'm vegetarian and have been so for the last 25 of 32 years of my life.

I used to smoke 2 years ago and quit cold turkey.  I have a Membership to a Gym (La Fitness) and go 3x a week and commute to work 5x a week for a round trip of 14 miles and also ride 2 times a week between 30-45 miles and alternate once a week with mountain biking for about 15 miles.  I have been trying to loose weight to look good for my wedding coming up in April and for the last few months with regular exercise and cycling I have all but accomplished that goal in the last 7 months. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My diet currently consists of a few things, in the mornings I eat carbs an hour before my commute to work for the needed energy (I&amp;#39;m averaging around 16 mph) which usually consists of a bagel and some sort of fruit when I&amp;#39;m at work after the ride.  For lunch its usually one of those smart one&amp;#39;s frozen dinners and a protein shake.  Dinner is usually more carbs or sushi (salmon).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dropped 30 pounds, so now I&amp;#39;m to that second part, gaining muscle mass.  My main problem as I&amp;#39;ve been told at this point is my diet, I&amp;#39;m vegetarian and have been so for the last 25 of 32 years of my life.

I spend more time on the computer, but I&amp;#39;m focused on being productive or having fun with my friends while I&amp;#39;m on it. My mind has become a lot worse since I started to quit and I have sexual thoughts about every female that breathes even though I can shake them off most of the time.  Once the pressure builds up, no matter how pumped I am to abstain from fapping,no matter how determined I am to quit, I fail in just 1 moment of weakness and blow it all apart.  I can spend hours on a computer and not come close to watching porn or masturbating, but that time where I&amp;#39;m online for just a few minutes to do homework is where I really fail.  Here recently I have started falling more to porn instead of fapping just by thoughts or brain images.  My streaks are getting shorter almost everytime.  I just can&amp;#39;t tell what I&amp;#39;m doing wrong.  Can someone out there try and point out to me what I might be doing wrong?  I really need some guidance here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","mod_reports":[]}

Sorry in advance, I&amp;#39;m super wordy even when I try not to be:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband and I have been married for 3 years, but together for nearly 11 at this point.  I&amp;#39;m 28 and he&amp;#39;s 27. We always knew we wanted kids, but were waiting until the timing was right.  (Financially secure, education finished, wanting to move to the next step, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, we both decided in August that the timing was right, after a cross-country move and DH getting a fantastic new job after grad school.  I had to quit my job for the move, and have been job-hunting ever since with no luck :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So basically aside from getting into shape (I&amp;#39;m down 20lbs and back to my high school/college weight!) finding a new job and trying to meet new people I don&amp;#39;t have a ton to distract me from the TTC process.  I kept getting more and more anxious to start in case it took us a long time or we had any problems, since it&amp;#39;s been a BABY EXPLOSION with our friends over the past couple of years.  I&amp;#39;m talking 9 babies, here.  So when DH gave the green light to start TTC I was incredibly excited.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;August was a bit of a bust, because the green light came basically as I was ovulating, and we didn&amp;#39;t get to time BD perfectly.  Plus I had been putting off ordering OPKs and HPTs or reading TTC specific books/forums because I was expecting him to be ready more in the September/October time frame, so I wasn&amp;#39;t really prepared and didn&amp;#39;t want to go crazy before we&amp;#39;d even started.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, since then I dove right in started scouring the web for everything TTC related and am definitely starting to go crazy.  I downloaded OvuView for my phone, and started documenting all my weird symptoms.  Even though I knew the chances were slim that I&amp;#39;d get pregnant our first try, especially since our timing wasn&amp;#39;t all that great, I held out some hope. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought I might have had implantation bleeding 9dpo last cycle but then a couple of days later my normally very regular 28/29 day cycle decided to troll me by giving me AF early.  So last month I had my first 26 day cycle EVER.  I was a bit bummed, but resolved to do a better job next cycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well this cycle rolled around, and aside from not charting temps, I think we did everything as well as we could have:  I tested using Wondfo OPKs, got a + on CD15, 16 &amp;amp; 17, which was a couple of days later than I assume I O&amp;#39;d last month, so that was interesting.  I started feeling my usual achy mittelschmerz pain late in the evening on the 16th, so my best guess is that I O&amp;#39;d between the 16th and 17th.  We BD on CD 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, &amp;amp; 19.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Near the end there it wasn&amp;#39;t our best work, but we got the job done.  We don&amp;#39;t usually have that much sex so it got a bit tiring.  I think next time we might ease up on the early BDing so we don&amp;#39;t wear ourselves out right before the critical O period hits.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever seen EWCM, but I know it got quite watery right around the O date, and I think that&amp;#39;s as fertile as my CM ever gets.  If we don&amp;#39;t end up with a pregnancy this month I&amp;#39;ll add Mucinex next time to see if that helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then I&amp;#39;ve been hanging out in my TWW, chasing at shadows and symptom spotting.  I&amp;#39;ve had cramping since O day, been dizzy and nauseated, had extra sore boobs, weird CM patterns, felt run down/exhausted, the works.  I know it&amp;#39;s probably just my body being a troll but it gives me hope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told myself I&amp;#39;d wait until AF was late (and my period has never been late by even a day in my entire life) before testing, but I have all these Wondfos and am scheduled for my pre-conception check up/pap tomorrow, so I figured I might as well test because if I AM pregnant I&amp;#39;d rather tell my new GYN at my appointment than have to call back and schedule another right after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So today at 9DPO (if I O&amp;#39;d on the night of the CD16 like I think I did) I took my first ever HPT.  It was a stark white failure.  No color at all, not even the faintest of squinty lines.  Just nothing.  Even though I know it&amp;#39;s still early, and nothing&amp;#39;s over until AF appears, it really socked me in the gut. If I got pregnant this cycle then it would have been perfect timing to tell all of our friends/family face to face when we travel home for the holidays...I&amp;#39;d already started thinking of clever ways to break the news.  Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll test again tomorrow before my appointment so if there&amp;#39;s any change I can let my new GYN know, but after that I&amp;#39;m just going to wait for AF to rear her ugly head.  It just sucks because after I get my pap tomorrow I&amp;#39;ll probably have some spotting and the whole time I&amp;#39;ll just be wishing it was implantation spotting instead. Ughhhhh. So frustrating.  And I&amp;#39;m only in cycle #2!  AF is due on Saturday so I&amp;#39;m just holding out hope that maybe she&amp;#39;ll be late this month. The TWW sucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Edit-\nTook another test this morning at 10DPO - BFN.  I&amp;#39;m going to wait until AF is late before I test again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Went to the gyno and got my pap, talked about TTC, and was tested for the Thalassemia trait (my husband is a carrier and I know his grandmother lost two babies due to having it, so I wanted to double check that I&amp;#39;m not also a carrier.)  She kept acting as though I&amp;#39;m already pregnant or would be soon, which is very positive, but also felt weird.  She also basically forced me to have a chlamydia test done &amp;quot;because it can affect a baby&amp;#39;s eyesight and you might be pregnant soon!&amp;quot; even though there&amp;#39;s no reason so suspect I have chlamydia or STIs of any type and I&amp;#39;m not pregnant yet. Wasn&amp;#39;t a huge fan of that, but I allowed her do the test just in case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She also chastised me for dieting (I just got back down to a normal BMI) because I had ketones in my urine.  I&amp;#39;m definitely not diabetic, but I&amp;#39;m about 2lbs away from my ideal weight goal and I didn&amp;#39;t get a chance to eat breakfast because I was running late for my appointment so I was like &amp;quot;Yeah I&amp;#39;m losing weight, to be healthier for a baby! &amp;quot; I get the impression she thought I was starving myself to be a lot thinner than I am currently which is not the case, I just finally reached a healthy weight goal after being 20lbs overweight is all!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I definitely bled during my pap (although that&amp;#39;s normal for me) but she didn&amp;#39;t offer me a pad or anything which I thought was odd. Now my uterus is all crampy and I&amp;#39;m spotting a bit.  Ugh. Overall she wasn&amp;#39;t the worst gyn I&amp;#39;ve ever seen, but I&amp;#39;m not sure if I&amp;#39;ll be keeping her.  She told me the most common first sign of pregnancy was sore boobs and I was like &amp;quot;my boobs are sore all the time.&amp;quot;  She also kept telling me about non-Thalassemia related genetic testing, for things that don&amp;#39;t run in my or DH&amp;#39;s family, and I was like &amp;quot;Yeah, I know.

Like a lot of good public jobs, the plan for my wife and baby is a LOT cheaper than the one with me included. \n\nMy work offers a spending credit plan, which I've been putting into a 401k instead of premiums for a good five years. I don't want to give this up as this is money on top of my meager salary. \n\nSo I'm thinking of just getting a high-deductible health plan privately for myself, keeping my 401K spending credit and moving off from my wife's health plan.\n\nI see some of these plans have out of pocket maxes of $6500 or so.

I am now convinced it's haunted.","author":"Mister_Blank","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjxn","stickied":false,"subreddit":"Paranormal","selftext":"I lived in this house from when I was 6 years old until about age 12 when my parents divorced and I went to live with my mom. My dad and I grew apart after that because he remarried and basically started a whole separate family. \n\nI am 32 now and don't have any kids of my own. But now his kids who are 18 and 19, my half brothers, are grown and heading off to college and he recently contacted me because he wanted to be in my life more. His wife died a couple of years ago from ovarian cancer and with the boys gone he was feeling very lonely.  I had never met her but I could tell he really misses her. \n\nSo I agreed I would drive down and stay the weekend with him and we would catch up. It was pretty awkward. I enjoyed seeing him again (we talked on the phone every so often), but we really didn't have much to talk about so I decided to turn in early. I slept in my old room which has a door that is connected to the room next to it which was a guest room when I lived there as a kid and it was one of my brother's rooms until he moved out.\n\nSomething odd I noticed was that in both rooms there was furniture pushed up against both sides of the door that the rooms shared. I figured it was because the brothers wanted their privacy. I don't know either of them at all, but I really don't want to, they both seem like douchebags. Anyways, I laid down in the bed and started to doze off when I heard what sounded like something being dragged across the floor.  \n\nI sat up thinking maybe my dad was doing something out in the living room but the lights were off. All throughout the night I kept hearing it just as I was falling to sleep and in the morning when I got up I noticed that the dresser had been moved about 6 inches at an angle away from the door.\n\nI walked out into the living room and asked my dad if he had come into the room at all the night before and he said no why? I told him that the dresser had been moved. I swear he went pale for a minute and said he didn't know but not to move the dresser because the boys would get mad (uh, ok?).\n\nThat next night, nothing happened, but Sunday night on my last night there, the same thing happened. I made absolutely sure the dresser was pushed all the way towards the door as far as it could go. And sure enough as I began to fall asleep it happened again. I turned on the light and it was 3-4 inches away from the wall. I got up and went out into the living room to watch TV and my dad came out and asked if everything was alright. I told him what happened and he said yeah that's why the furniture is there otherwise the door keeps opening....\"You don't remember?\"  And I was like, huh?  He said weird things had been happening ever since we had first moved in when I was a kid.\n\nHe told me I used to tell him a little girl would come up to the bed and ask me to play with her. He told me a previous owner's child had drowned in the in ground pool in the backyard and that when I described her the description matched.  I have absolutely no recollection of that happening, but then again I was very young. I do remember once when a dog we had gave birth to a litter of puppies, one of them went under the house and I was the only one small enough to go in and get her. I vaguely remember telling my mom and dad that I saw someone under there, but I don't remember the actual incident. I have a terrible memory FYI.  \n\nAnyways, just thought I would share. My dad acts like it's no big deal, he is not scared and just lives with it but he does not like talking about it, not because he is afraid but because he is kind of the typical macho dad who thinks stuff like that is stupid and if it is real just ignore because it can't hurt you.  \n\nI am going down to stay with him again this weekend and his boys, my half brothers Randy and Dale will be there too. It ought to be interesting. I will update if anything else weird happens, or see if either one of them says anything about what goes on there.\n\nSome have suggested adding my updates on the situation to the original post so that they are all together, so here they are.\n\n*Update 1:*\n\nSo I just had lunch with my mom and decided to ask her about our old house. First of all, she was pissed that I went to see my dad and didn't tell her. They have not spoken in years and are not on good terms at all. She told me that when I was a kid I would talk about seeing a little girl in my room just like my dad said. \n\nI was blown away by what she told me next. The little girl who drowned was the daughter of the previous owner, the owner who sold the house to my parents! Apparently the woman's name is Wendy and she was a friend of my mom and dad. My mom never told me because she didn't think it was necessary, but when I started to see the girl when I was younger they didn't know what to think. \n\nI mean, I have vague memories of playing with kids at that house and yes, one of them was a little blond headed girl who was my age at the time, but I don't ever remember being scared. My mom said I only saw her until I was about 9 or 10 and then I didn't mention her anymore, except for one time when they were having a Christmas party and I came out and asked my mom tell the little girl to stop waking me up. Thing is, no one at the party had brought any kids with them. \n\nAnyways, she said some more stuff but I am actually at work so I will tell what else she said when I get off.\n\n*Update 2:*\n\nSo here is what my mom told me. She said I was not the only one who saw and heard things, and this is weird for me to hear because I never noticed anything was amiss and don't remember thinking anything was off about my childhood. She said she experienced little things too, hearing a voice, hearing footsteps, stuff going missing and reappearing in weird places. But she never felt scared until I told her I saw a \"black man\" under the house. Not an African-American, mind you. But a man that was all black. Gotta run for now, boss is coming.\n\n*Update 3:* \n\nWell, I spent last night at my dad's again but this time I slept in a different room because my brothers both slept in their own rooms (the two that share the door in the middle). \n\nAt breakfast today I just flat out asked them if anything supernatural happened in the house and they pretty much laughed me out of the room. I talked to my dad later and he said to be honest the activity had been very quiet for many years, only a few odd things happening now and then. \n\nBut it had been pretty active for the week since I left and came back, just like it was when we first lived there. He thinks it's because of me, that maybe this little girl was shy but when I came back she is getting frisky again. The oldest of my younger brothers, Dale, is going back to his dorms today but Randy will still be here which means tonight I will sleep in Dale's room (originally my room) tonight. \n\nI'll update if anything like what happened last week occurs. I don't have a camera still, even my phone is an old flip up Cricket phone. It takes still shots but they are so muddy you can barely see anything. Walmart has some cheap ones but I'm told, especially for catching stuff like this, they are quite crappy so I have nothing to catch any images on really. We'll see how it goes tonight.\n\n\n*Update 4:*\n\nThis past weekend was hit and miss. The problem is now that I am expecting to see odd things, everything seems like it could be supernatural. Every creak, bump or thud has me on edge. I'm not scared, per se, just...anxious?  It was also really cold and very windy all weekend. There was ONE time were I thought I saw something outside my window, but again, I'm just not sure. \n\nFor a moment it looked like a head peaked into the window and went back down. It was a very fluid motion, not quick, not as if someone noticed you saw them and ducked down real fast. The dresser did not move but the door that is wedged between both rooms seemed like it was rattling all night Saturday night. But was it wind coming in through the windows (some air still gets through, they are really old) or something else? Randy says he didn't hear anything, but I know he heard the door rattling too, it was too loud not to.\n\nI did get to meet my dad's next door neighbor. She is 91 years old and her name is Dorothy, the most kindhearted woman I have ever met. She said she remembers when the little girl drowned. Her name was Karen and she was 9 at the time (roughly my age when I lived there as a kid). She said she babysat me a couple of times and I had the most active imagination of any child she had ever seen, that I would play by myself for hours talking to my imaginary friends. I asked her if she ever noticed anything unusual happening in or around my dad's house but if she knew I meant paranormal stuff, she didn't let on. She did say neighborhood kids were rowdy and caused trouble sometimes. \n\nI did ask her if anyone else had passed away in the house and she said a man named Mr. Gruber, a German immigrant, died about 40 years ago but she didn't know from what. At that point I think she knew what I was getting at and she told me she had to go inside because her church group was coming (this was on Sunday and people from her church come to her since she can't really go to them, which I though was nice).\n\nSo aside from learning the little girl's name and thinking I heard the door rattling, as if someone was trying to come in, that's all I have to report. I will not be going to see my dad this coming weekend or the one after that, but I do plan on seeing him near the end of the month even if I just drive down for the day.","created_utc":1380661357,"is_self":true,"link_flair_css_class":null,"media":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":100,"retrieved_on":1411763166,"mod_reports":[],"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lived in this house from when I was 6 years old until about age 12 when my parents divorced and I went to live with my mom. My dad and I grew apart after that because he remarried and basically started a whole separate family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am 32 now and don&amp;#39;t have any kids of my own. But now his kids who are 18 and 19, my half brothers, are grown and heading off to college and he recently contacted me because he wanted to be in my life more. His wife died a couple of years ago from ovarian cancer and with the boys gone he was feeling very lonely.  I had never met her but I could tell he really misses her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I agreed I would drive down and stay the weekend with him and we would catch up. It was pretty awkward. I enjoyed seeing him again (we talked on the phone every so often), but we really didn&amp;#39;t have much to talk about so I decided to turn in early. I slept in my old room which has a door that is connected to the room next to it which was a guest room when I lived there as a kid and it was one of my brother&amp;#39;s rooms until he moved out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something odd I noticed was that in both rooms there was furniture pushed up against both sides of the door that the rooms shared. I figured it was because the brothers wanted their privacy. I don&amp;#39;t know either of them at all, but I really don&amp;#39;t want to, they both seem like douchebags. Anyways, I laid down in the bed and started to doze off when I heard what sounded like something being dragged across the floor.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat up thinking maybe my dad was doing something out in the living room but the lights were off. All throughout the night I kept hearing it just as I was falling to sleep and in the morning when I got up I noticed that the dresser had been moved about 6 inches at an angle away from the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked out into the living room and asked my dad if he had come into the room at all the night before and he said no why? I told him that the dresser had been moved. I swear he went pale for a minute and said he didn&amp;#39;t know but not to move the dresser because the boys would get mad (uh, ok?).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That next night, nothing happened, but Sunday night on my last night there, the same thing happened. I made absolutely sure the dresser was pushed all the way towards the door as far as it could go. And sure enough as I began to fall asleep it happened again. I turned on the light and it was 3-4 inches away from the wall. I got up and went out into the living room to watch TV and my dad came out and asked if everything was alright. I told him what happened and he said yeah that&amp;#39;s why the furniture is there otherwise the door keeps opening....&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t remember?&amp;quot;  And I was like, huh?  He said weird things had been happening ever since we had first moved in when I was a kid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told me I used to tell him a little girl would come up to the bed and ask me to play with her. He told me a previous owner&amp;#39;s child had drowned in the in ground pool in the backyard and that when I described her the description matched.  I have absolutely no recollection of that happening, but then again I was very young. I do remember once when a dog we had gave birth to a litter of puppies, one of them went under the house and I was the only one small enough to go in and get her. I vaguely remember telling my mom and dad that I saw someone under there, but I don&amp;#39;t remember the actual incident. I have a terrible memory FYI.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, just thought I would share. My dad acts like it&amp;#39;s no big deal, he is not scared and just lives with it but he does not like talking about it, not because he is afraid but because he is kind of the typical macho dad who thinks stuff like that is stupid and if it is real just ignore because it can&amp;#39;t hurt you.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am going down to stay with him again this weekend and his boys, my half brothers Randy and Dale will be there too. It ought to be interesting. I will update if anything else weird happens, or see if either one of them says anything about what goes on there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some have suggested adding my updates on the situation to the original post so that they are all together, so here they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 1:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I just had lunch with my mom and decided to ask her about our old house. First of all, she was pissed that I went to see my dad and didn&amp;#39;t tell her. They have not spoken in years and are not on good terms at all. She told me that when I was a kid I would talk about seeing a little girl in my room just like my dad said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was blown away by what she told me next. The little girl who drowned was the daughter of the previous owner, the owner who sold the house to my parents! Apparently the woman&amp;#39;s name is Wendy and she was a friend of my mom and dad. My mom never told me because she didn&amp;#39;t think it was necessary, but when I started to see the girl when I was younger they didn&amp;#39;t know what to think. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, I have vague memories of playing with kids at that house and yes, one of them was a little blond headed girl who was my age at the time, but I don&amp;#39;t ever remember being scared. My mom said I only saw her until I was about 9 or 10 and then I didn&amp;#39;t mention her anymore, except for one time when they were having a Christmas party and I came out and asked my mom tell the little girl to stop waking me up. Thing is, no one at the party had brought any kids with them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, she said some more stuff but I am actually at work so I will tell what else she said when I get off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here is what my mom told me. She said I was not the only one who saw and heard things, and this is weird for me to hear because I never noticed anything was amiss and don&amp;#39;t remember thinking anything was off about my childhood. She said she experienced little things too, hearing a voice, hearing footsteps, stuff going missing and reappearing in weird places. But she never felt scared until I told her I saw a &amp;quot;black man&amp;quot; under the house. Not an African-American, mind you. But a man that was all black. Gotta run for now, boss is coming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 3:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I spent last night at my dad&amp;#39;s again but this time I slept in a different room because my brothers both slept in their own rooms (the two that share the door in the middle). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At breakfast today I just flat out asked them if anything supernatural happened in the house and they pretty much laughed me out of the room. I talked to my dad later and he said to be honest the activity had been very quiet for many years, only a few odd things happening now and then. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it had been pretty active for the week since I left and came back, just like it was when we first lived there. He thinks it&amp;#39;s because of me, that maybe this little girl was shy but when I came back she is getting frisky again. The oldest of my younger brothers, Dale, is going back to his dorms today but Randy will still be here which means tonight I will sleep in Dale&amp;#39;s room (originally my room) tonight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll update if anything like what happened last week occurs. I don&amp;#39;t have a camera still, even my phone is an old flip up Cricket phone. It takes still shots but they are so muddy you can barely see anything. Walmart has some cheap ones but I&amp;#39;m told, especially for catching stuff like this, they are quite crappy so I have nothing to catch any images on really. We&amp;#39;ll see how it goes tonight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 4:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This past weekend was hit and miss. The problem is now that I am expecting to see odd things, everything seems like it could be supernatural. Every creak, bump or thud has me on edge. I&amp;#39;m not scared, per se, just...anxious?  It was also really cold and very windy all weekend. There was ONE time were I thought I saw something outside my window, but again, I&amp;#39;m just not sure. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a moment it looked like a head peaked into the window and went back down. It was a very fluid motion, not quick, not as if someone noticed you saw them and ducked down real fast. The dresser did not move but the door that is wedged between both rooms seemed like it was rattling all night Saturday night. But was it wind coming in through the windows (some air still gets through, they are really old) or something else? Randy says he didn&amp;#39;t hear anything, but I know he heard the door rattling too, it was too loud not to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did get to meet my dad&amp;#39;s next door neighbor. She is 91 years old and her name is Dorothy, the most kindhearted woman I have ever met. She said she remembers when the little girl drowned. Her name was Karen and she was 9 at the time (roughly my age when I lived there as a kid). She said she babysat me a couple of times and I had the most active imagination of any child she had ever seen, that I would play by myself for hours talking to my imaginary friends. I asked her if she ever noticed anything unusual happening in or around my dad&amp;#39;s house but if she knew I meant paranormal stuff, she didn&amp;#39;t let on. She did say neighborhood kids were rowdy and caused trouble sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did ask her if anyone else had passed away in the house and she said a man named Mr. Gruber, a German immigrant, died about 40 years ago but she didn&amp;#39;t know from what.

I think I&amp;#39;m shallow at RB (don&amp;#39;t like anyone other than Morris and Woodhead and Woodhead is a bit of a wild card) and would like a more consistent flex for the future. I am thinking about offering Rodgers and Morris for RG3, Spiller and Antonio Brown. Brown seems like a legit WR2 and I&amp;#39;m hoping to buy low on Spiller.

We go to two different colleges that are only 1.5 hours apart. I know everyone thinks there relationship is different, but I truly think our relationship was different. We had been dating since 8th grade and we were best friends and did everything together. She was there for me through the toughest parts of my life (mom's suicide attempt and constant moving). We always had each other's back and would do anything for one another. This past summer I lived at her house since my mom moved away from me and left me and my dog to fend for ourselves. The summer was a blast and the best one I had ever had in my life. We didn't fight and had fun. She went to college over the summer for 6 weeks and we didn't have any problems or anything.\n\nEverything we both went to college. When we first came to college, I had really bad anxiety of being away and not knowing anything. I know I pushed her away during this time, but it only lasted a week and a half. During that time, we took a one day break just so I could clear my head. Then, the next weekend we saw each other and everything was good and normal. Then, I went back to school and I w as fine for the most part. I was better and we just acted like we had always done. The only issue we had was that I got upset one time that she didnt call me back. I had waited an hour for her to call me back and she said \"Oh, my phone was on the couch and I was playing with my friends.\" All I said was that I understand and don't mind that you are hanging with your friends and stuff, but I just thought you were going to call me back. I said next time just send me quick text to let me know. She said okay and everything was fine. A week passed, and it was a Thursday. She was supposed to come up and visit me that weekend for my birthday. However, I could tell something was bothering her, so I asked. She said \"I'll tell you later.\" I waited and she told me later we should take a \"week break because she needed space and she didn't feel as strongly anymore.\" That week was terrible, waiting, but not knowing what for. Anyways, I made it the week and she told me \"I think we should break up.\" I was devastated and never saw it coming. Where had the girl who wanted to be with me forever gone? I later found out that she had bought me a promise ring and sold it during the week break. I also found out that her roommate, who I have never had any communication with, was telling her to break up with me, but her other roommate was telling her to stay with me. Also, during the week break she developed a crush on another guy. I talked to her about this and I know it is just a rebound crush and because he is there to comfort her. She told me that we would not have problems if we went to the same school. I feel betrayed. We have so many good memories and I just feel like she has forgotten about all of them. She had always been the one that I thought loved me more and she always fantasized about our future together. Where has this girl gone?\n\nI am still madly in love with her and I understand she is lost and confused, but I just don't understand what went wrong. I get she is in a new environment with new people, but what we had was so strong and she's always with our friends. She thinks that we will end up together in the future, but I know that I cannot wait around for her. I just feel lost sometimes and stuck. It all happened so fast and it was all her choice. We didn't have a fight or anything. I know people change, but it was a matter of 3 days between when she bought the promise ring and decided to take the break. I am upset and miss her, but I feel bad for her at the same time since she is so confused.

Please note that normally I go to clubs once a month maximum, usually feeling awkward dancing and failing at attracting female attention. Looks wise I'm 5'10\", about 13% bodyfat but noticeable levels of muscle, I've also pretty stylish as I love fashion. Nevertheless, whilst I can hold good conversation, I'm pretty introverted and this certainly is out of character for me.\n\nIt's first week of college/uni and I'm going into third year, all the freshers are here and there's quite the party atmosphere at night.\n\n**Enjoy the music.**\n\nLast night me and my 3 mates decided to have a night out. We're all shamefully terrible at dancing and lack a fair bit of confidence with girls. Before i went out I had 3 or 4 shots and shared a bowl of weed with one of my buddies.\n\nWhen I got to the club, after already playing loads of dance music at home, I was incredibly high energy. The dance floor was empty and everybody was scared to take the plunge, me and my buddies just went for it, with no cares in the world we just danced and truly enjoyed ourselves.\n\nIt didn't take long to fill up. Once people saw us having insane fun, not caring about our 'dance moves' and just moving to the music people naturally gravitate and want to be a part of it. It was at this point I stopped worrying about not knowing how to dance, the club was empty and I was using loads of space, I wasn't gaming at this point, I was loving the moment.\n\nOnly 15 minutes in a girl dancing suspiciously close and seductively caught my eye. I'm not sure how I should describe her other than small-ish, brunette with a cute face and a total killer arse. I started with eye contact and a smile, I was in my own world and didn't know how to progress from here other than enjoy the music.\n\n**Escalate.**\n\nHere I started to do something that I accidentally developed recently on holiday in Greece, I shamelessly checked her out. She had already given me IOIs and aside from wanting to check her out I wanted her to know I was doing it. I instantly make eye contact afterwards and she doesn't break it, I approach. At this point she was stood in a circle of people, as I formed space in the circle, directing my attention to her, I smiled and danced jokingly with the AFC who had been dancing with her the entire time. He was no threat to me now.\n\nEscalating to the next stage took another 10 minutes or so of dancing, if I wasn't slightly high I would have done it faster, albeit certainly not as smoothly. I danced with her shamelessly, slowly turning my body away from the group and isolating just me and her. I played the girl in this game and grinded my glutes on her. I danced outrageously, when she looked at me funny or questioningly at my dance moves, I was unphased, I laughed and continued. I kept speaking to the bare minimum I found her name and made a joke about some pop culture related to it which she has probably heard all the time, but I made it smoothly and confidently. \n\nAfter continued physical contact I went for a kiss, at first she seemed reluctant but as I've read a thousand times I didn't change my frame, I stepped one stage back on the escalation ladder and tried again successfully only minutes later. I made sure to break away from the kiss first before continuing it 30 seconds later. The kissing ramped up quickly, soon we were squeezing each other close and she was grabbing my hair and back. \n**\nIsolate.**\n\nNext stage I knew to isolate, I convinced her to go to the smoking area, again the first time I was met with a reluctance which I nonchalantly brushed off. Following her up the stairs I made an effort to check her out, when she turned around at the top of the stairs I didn;t change my actions, I pulled a face which could only look like [this\n](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/012/834/manfaceaua.jpg)\n\nOutside I sat close enough so I could touch her legs and her back the entire time. I spoke incredibly honestly and naturally about everything, I didn't pause to think 'is this what I should be saying at this point'. Rather I spoke to her as though she was another person who I was frankly deeply interested in. She explicitly stated she wouldn't sleep with me tonight and I jokingly batted it away. As we were speaking I lost all track of time, conversation flowed so easily it felt like it wasn't even me.\n\nHere's a problem I never thought I would encounter. She had huge resistance to my advances as she believed I was some sort of pick up artist who prayed on first years, she said I've done this a thousand times, that there was only one thing i was interested in. I was shocked. Really? Was this actually happening? Me? I continued to play with her, stopping to kiss her, grabbing her number before friends arrived and again being truthfully honest to hope she didn't believe this was some sort of regular occurrence to me, particularly when my retorts were so slick - For example, when asking her what nationality she was (she looked a little exotic) she told me she was a part spanish, without missing a beat and with all the confidence in the world I told her that explained her great arse. \n\nBy the time she had to go leave and find her friends I had convinced her I'm not some sort of casanova, I casually told her I'll text her and as we parted ways I left her with a cheeky slap on the arse and a smile. \n\n**Afterwards.**\n\nWhen I left her I was on cloud 9, I wasn't sure if I was still high or just pulsing with adrenaline and excitement. I went to the dance floor and just lost myself, I didn't care what anybody thought. Everybody was coming up to me and smiling, high fiving; guys and girls alike. A couple times a girl would physically dance towards and into me seductively, trying to get me to grind with her, but I didn't care. I was far too excited with what just occurred and I wanted to enjoy the moment.\n\nOnce home I jokingly text her saying I'm safe, that I know shes concerned. She quickly responded that she's sorry she isn't here with me and that she will 'always come back with me if I need'. Wow.\n\n**Teaching points.**\n\nEnjoy yourself first in a club, become the highest energy person and have the most fun out of anybody\nDon't care if you can't dance, move to the music and beat, smile.\nEye contact, escalate.\nIf you get knocked back don't stop kino, just go back one stage on the ladder and try again.\nIsolate.\nBe a man.\n\nI truly thank all the contributors to this subreddit and to the community. Although I couldn't see myself using pickup to try get one night stands all the time (I'm a bit too emotional for that), it's given me an incredibly confidence and ability to meet girls I could only before dream of meeting.\n\nMajor respect to you for reading this and I wish you all the success.\n","is_self":true,"media":null,"link_flair_css_class":"frflair","author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":82,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First time posting here, it&amp;#39;s a throwaway as I don&amp;#39;t want to link it to my other account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So after reading a lot about seduction in order to improve myself as a person and gain confidence/a chance with girls I just had the best night of my life.
