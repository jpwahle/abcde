I am very insecure with my crossdressing but seeing everyone on here gives me a level of comfort haha.\n\nI'm going to give a little life story if that's alright.\n\nI've been into feminine clothing since I was little but I've never really brought it out too much in public. Back when I was in middle school I actually went to school one day wearing a feminine top and jeans.\n\nI got ridiculed by other kids and it made me burst into tears. Even after that I still haven't lost my love for dressing up.\n\nFast forward to now and I'm 26 and I own various articles of female clothing, but I mainly just wear them all inside my home. The only thing I wear out in public is stuff no one can really see haha.\n\nAnyway, I'm writing this hoping I can gain some confidence and just express myself in the near future. I want to be able to pass in public and just be who I am inside, you know? Life's too short for me to worry, yet I'm still deathly scared to take that leap forward.\n\nI know it's crucial to take it one step at a time yet it's finding it within myself to make that first step. I don't really have many irl friends to support me either atm. 😅\n\nSorry for the life story, I needed to get this aired out somehow.

It isn't strictly sex, although that does play a major role. I'd love to sneak out and go dancing, night swimming, etc. I like lying in bed naked listening to new music. I am very 420 friendly, and grow my own so it'd be nice to have a lab rat as well haha. \n\nA little about me: I am 5' 10\", broad shoulders and a dad bod. Tattoos, beard, and as I'm told, great hair. I like gardening, music, and cooking. I am a chef, and I've always had fun sneaking my APs into work after close, cooking some food and having some fun in my office.  \n\nWhat I'm looking for in a mistress: Feminine is a must. Smooth, silky, and slim. Short is a plus, but taller doesn't bother me much. You must be someone that can host, for obvious reasons. I like having somewhere to go when the responsibilities of life get heavy and I need to unwind. Open to all kinds and walks of life. I'd like to get to know you a bit too. Likes\/dislikes. \n\nDon't be afraid to message first, I'm pretty approachable and outgoing. Let me know your favorite food!

In this RP I'll be playing as Shion, a 32-year-old fox girl (kitsune), who has long straight white hair that matches her fur around her fluffy ears and tail. She has clear sky blue eyes and soft lips. She is on the curvier side, especially on her hips and thighs. She has very pale skin and a mole under her left eye. Finally, she's 5'5 and has a D cup.\n\nThis can be a short term scenario or a longer one if we click\/we want to take it far! In this RP I'd love to play as an average monster girl, nothing too outstanding about her (or at least she thinks that way). And that's what bothers her. She's missing a spark and decides to get herself out there. She'll reopen her old tinder profile, she'd go to her favourite café wearing nicer outfits and make up... And that's where you show up! How do we meet is up to you, but those were my hooks! :)  I have no real preferences for your looks tho I would like you to be a bit younger than her ( between 21 and 31) but around her age is fine too. We can choose to make it a one night thing or develop into something greater. \n\nSo here's something to give you a better idea of the prompt:\nAfter I stopped working, closing down my laptop, I looked around the internet café. The chilly air of an early autumn sent a shiver around my legs as a young couple stepped inside. It was clear he was the nerdier one, dragging her down to the little comic book section the café had. I smiled but quickly sighed after taking a sip of my hot chocolate. I realized something. I'm 32... I'm getting older... I'll probably never experience something like that girl is again. Is it too late for me? No. \n\n\"Shion...\" I whispered to myself while shaking my head \"Are you actually doing this?\". I smiled as I looked at my older pictures on my tinder profile. Fitter, sexier, younger... \"Would guys that age still like me?\" I thought to myself as I set the app to look for guys from 21 and up. \"Well that was dumb, surely none of those would match me\" \n\n\"The morning was unproductively spent on tinder, let's go to the internet café and get to work, shall we?\" I thought reaching for my usual shirt. I lingered for a second before tossing it away. I pulled out of the closet a nice cream colored low cut sweater, letting my shoulders and a bit of cleavage show. My blue jeans were swapped for a black skirt, so tight it barely fit, but didn't look bad at all. Thigh highs to match and some light make up on my face... \"That was quite the transformation... I guess?\" I thought and shrugged as I took everything and headed off.\n\n\nSo here it is! Hopefully you like it enough to send me a chat! Don't use messages please.\n\nI'd like for you to introduce yourself a bit first, tell me about your character, your kinks and limits and finally if you want to tweak anything about this RP.\n\nMy kinks are cumplay, being sub or switch, breeding, name calling, cheating, monster girls (I like my bit of fantasy) and a few more that I'm willing to explore.\n\nMy limits are piss, scat, gore and generally some of the most extreme stuff.\nI hope to hear from you soon, bye!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dirtypenpals","subreddit_subscribers":486629,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[F4M] Fuck, Marry or Breed the sexy fox lady","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.88,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtypenpals\/comments\/xsgzuy\/f4m_fuck_marry_or_breed_the_sexy_fox_lady\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Thanks for everyone in advance who will read this mess. &lt;3\n\nWell, I'm also a \"completionist\" in Overwatch: except OWL team skins and golden weapons, I own every item (including Pink Mercy, Blizzcon Bastion, etc.) and I also have around 188000 coins left. The thing is, I loved the previous system in Overwatch: if you played the game (not even for an excessive time) and farmed out the arcade lootboxes (I completed every arcade weekly challenges for the 3 lootboxes since the beginning, and never missed one), you were able to stack up this amount of coins and also getting every new item. Yes, lootboxes had it's unfairness, being totally random, and having the possibility to not earning the item you wanted, but honestly, the drop rates wasn't that horrible.\n\nActually, the last time I bought lootboxes was the first Archives event! After that I never had to pay real money, because for a little bit of grinding I was able to get every new item and if I didn't, I was able to get coins from the duplicates to buy them. It was a great and fair system, you had the B option to earn a specific item. Well, it was fair at least for completionists like me, and I understand that this system was so fair, that Blizzard didn't get much money out of me. \n\nOW2 will be my first game with a BP system and I was a bit scared that I couldn't grind out all 80 levels. I'm 33, have other priorities, I can't play that much anymore, but OW is my comfy game and being rewarded for investing my little spare time into the game felt good. Now my concerns aren't the BP anymore. The fact that you can buy the BP but you basically get an old event's grey, blue and some purple tier items is a huge let down, and the Shop system is probably the worst. As I explained before, you had many ways to get an item in OW: lucky lootbox openings, getting coins from duplicates, and you were able to farm both. My main issue is that you CAN'T grind enough to have enough premium coins to unlock everything and if I get it right, there are certain items you HAVE TO pay real money and no other way to get them? So even premium coins isn't enough now, which has more value now but also waaaay more expensive and you can't \"cheap\" them out with playing and grinding? \n\nI was always a collecting type of personality and the reason I loved OW is that it's item earning system never felt unfair and the amount of grinding in a week was just perfect for a 33 year old guy with other hobbies and a job. I was so hyped about OW2 but now I'm just stressed and confused. Yes, I know, it's not mandatory to get all new items, yes, these are just cosmetics, but if you have a full collection in OW (and many of us do), locking content behind paywalls and microtransactions just doesn't feel right, especially with these prices. I get that the game is free to play, but they should've come up with a more user friendlier approach, setting a new way and standards in this monetization system. Betrayed might be a strong word to describe my feelings toward the new OW2 system, but I do feel disappointed and being let down. Especially in this crazy world where so many currencies are inflating in the world, it's just ruff. I just wanted to have fun and collecting the items by just playing the game sometimes.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Overwatch","subreddit_id":"t5_2u5kl","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Overwatch","subreddit_subscribers":4006777,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"About the new system in OW2 ~ an item collector's perspective","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.57,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Overwatch\/comments\/xsh1j1\/about_the_new_system_in_ow2_an_item_collectors\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

That being said if you are not from west aus I am still more than happy to chat with you!\n\nMy name is Jack, I'm 19 and I'm studying cyber forensics and internetworking security at uni, I'm in my 2nd year but I hope to go on for a few more years to get some more letters at the start of my name! haha\n\nThat has to be my biggest long term goal, however some other goals of mine would be to find my dream car (I'm so close!), move out, finish my undergraduate degree, improve my skin and hair care (I'm trying quite a bit of products and I have the hair care okay (not the style lol) and my skin is better but I'd love to have it better) and find a girlfriend, hence why I am here!\n\nFor the past few years I've been heavily into formula 1, never missing a race (even the 3am ones and even worse, the 7 am ones!) I also enjoy doing photography and have recently started thinking about more landscape\/urban photography. I also do enjoy gaming, I really want to get into animal crossing more but I've been super busy with uni, however I've somehow found time for my current addiction of Destiny 2. I also play rainbow six siege, less than before unfortunately, but I'd like to get more into it (for those wondering my highest rank is diamond 3). I also mentioned before about buying my dream car, I love JDM cars and unfortunately haven't been to a car meet in over a year now. My introduction to photography was through cars so if you'd like to see some of my photos do let me know! \n\nAs for what I look like I'm 5\"11' brown hair that touches the base of my neck and never acts normally. I am 73kg and I have brown eyes. That's a basic description of me but if you want a picture that's not an issue\n\nI'm not really too good at writing these advertisements or making titles or finishing them off so I'll just say if I sound appealing to you or you wanna know more do shoot me a message!\n\nThanks for reading!

I've always been a good (Christian) girl, I go to church three times a week, twice on Sunday and every Wednesday Night.\nWednesdays we had youth group, but I recently switched over to the \"Christ in College\" class for older kids. (I guess kids isn't the right word, but I still feel like and call myself one so I'll use it) \n\nFor some context, I'm 18 as of April, very petite about 5'5 with long black hair, and very pale skin.\nMy eyes are blueish grey (depending on the light). \nI'm also a B cup, but I sometimes don't wear bras or bralettes. (Remember this) \n\nThe class is about 25 people, most of whom I know and see at church all the time. I joined with 3 others a few weeks ago when school started back up. \n\nI normally keep to myself, but when I joined the new class with some new faces and people who didn't have an already made opinion of me, I wanted to make more of myself.\nI started dressing up for the Wednesday classes, wearing makeup, and talking more.\nIt felt good.\nWednesday I wore a red sweater (it's always cold in the Church), knee length white skirt, white pantyhose, brown boots, and a black belt around the waist. \n\nClass is normally three parts; a game, food, then reading\/a lesson.\nEach part is normally a half hour, and after the lesson is over some of us stay around and just play games and hang out.\nWell, the game was mad house dodge ball.\nA constant-motion never-ending game with two teams. \n\nMy team lost, but it was still fun.\nI'm very competitive tho, and I played hard.\nBy the time it was over and we were all in line for food I was tired and mildly sweaty.\nOur leader (Pastor Matt), began his lesson while we were eating. The whole time one kid (named Bryson) kept looking at me, and it was obvious where he was looking.\nI looked down and to my horror, I had boob sweat. It wasn't bad, just two dark spots under my bust. But it was there, clear as day. And worse, my nipples were also showing through my sweater, again not crazy bad, but evident nonetheless. \n\nI was so embarrassed, I just melted into my seat and fiddled with my skirt making sure it was appropriate.\nThe lesson flew by, but I hardly got any of it.\nAfter it was over I went to a friend of mine (Bri) and asked her to text me her notes later.\nShe was(is) always so organized I knew I'd get something good from her.\nWhile talking to her I see Bryson out of the corner of my eye, still staring at me.\nHe comes up as soon as I'm done to tell me that \"I need to wear a bra\", and that I was \"taking his eyes off God.\"\nI was amazed at his guts, but knew in my heart he was right. \n\nI went to find Matt just before leaving to quickly apologize and tell him it was a good lesson.\nHe was in the kitchen cleaning up so I asked if he needed help, he said yes and that he was meaning to talk to me about something anyways.\nMy heart sank.\nI felt I knew what he was gonna say before he even said it.\nBut his words surprised me, he asked if I was \"wearing panties?\"\nMy mind went blank but then I told him honestly, \"No, just my pantyhose\"\nHe smiled and said \"And that's normal Violet, most women don't wear underwear with pantyhose, and that's okay...\nIt's the same with your bra,\nIf there's a verse in the Bible about needing to wear a bra I sure haven't seen it\"\nI was stunned and just stood in silence saying nothing.\n\"Here, come here,\" He said as he was waving his arms over for a hug. \n\nI was so confused, how did he know to say that? Was he right? What should I do?\nI felt so lost, I just went up to him and hugged him.\nAs he was holding me close I closed my eyes and relaxed.\nHe smelled nice.\nHis big arms keeping me safe, I'd never felt that way except with my dad. \n\nAll of a sudden he moved his hand up from my back up to my neck, he traces a line down my back and then up again before putting his hand under my neck. Lifting my head to his, I open my eyes and smile.\n\"God made you a woman of amazing beauty, I'll worship you as I would all his perfect creation.\"\nAs he finishes that thought, his other hand finds my breast and pinches my nipple through my shirt. \n\nThe touch was electric, I gasped. It felt good, but I knew it was wrong.\nI started to back away, but he still had a hand on my neck.\nHe squeezed and moved his other hand around my back, pulling me into him.\nMy breath was caught in my throat.\nHe smiled and whispered into my ear, \"God rewards his people right?\" \n\"Y-yy-ye-es,\" I said catching more of my breath as he loosed his grip slightly, I was starting to cry. \n\"Would you dare deprive me of His reward?\" He asked.\nI shook my head no.\nHe smiled again and kissed the top of my head, \"good girl\"\nThe feeling I had was so intense, but I felt good despite my confusion.\nI smiled and wiped my tears with my sleeve.\nI was feeling heat all over my body. \n\nHe pulled away and told me to stay there then left out into the rest of the church.\nI was left there thinking over what I wanted to do, over what just happened.\nIt was a lot, but I decided he was right, I was going to reward him.\nThe thought made me laugh as I came up with a plan, it felt so naughty.\nI went behind the counter and took off my boots, pantyhose, and belt.\nThe lights in the other rooms were turning off through the doorway.\nHe came back shortly and said he locked the doors and everyone was gone now.\nI smirked and looked him in the eyes. Just before I started with my plan he asked \"are you sure you want to do this V?\"\nStepping from behind the counter holding my pantyhose I told him, \"yes\" \n\nAll things considered, I was still very modest at the moment. My womanhood was warm and damp, and I was feeling the need to be touched, filled, and embraced.\nBut all Matt saw was a petite teen girl with runny makeup forcing a smile as she held her freshly worn pantyhose.\nMy body was mostly hidden from him as I still had on the sweater and skirt.\nHe was slow to remedy that. \n\nThe first thing he did was grab the garment from my hand, he brought them up to his nose and inhaled deeply.\nA moan escaped him. I giggled and grabbed his hand, lifting it to my breast.\nHe took it into his hand greedily, groping and feeling my chest. He was rubbing me all over, pulling me close, and squeezing my butt with my chest pressed into his.\nI gasped and moaned as he felt me.\nI kissed his neck\/chest and wished I was taller so I could reach his face.\nHe reached up under my skirt and touched my slit lightly.\nIt was on fire, I moaned more and started to cry again.\nIt was all so much, moving so fast.\nI think I came, my breaths were hard, heavy, and fast. \n\nBut then the worst happened.\nMy phone rang and based on the tone, I knew who it was.\nMy dad... \n\nEnd of pt1,\nThat all happened Wednesday, and some more happened after that, and again today (Friday)\nWe plan to meet again Sunday, if y'all like I'll share more.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Erotica","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqyy","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Erotica","subreddit_subscribers":179917,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I (F18) got touched by my pastor (M27)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.85,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Erotica\/comments\/xsh86o\/i_f18_got_touched_by_my_pastor_m27\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Working as a mercenary as one fateful day he meets (ur character) deciding to join her and help her [ofcorse we can do like the anime's story and i get added after installing military grade cybernetics but its up to u really]\n\nI only really have that idea we can try, so i request that we try making one together since it can make it more fun. For characters i prefer u rp as lucy as i wanna give her a more happy ending, though i wont force u to be her. So really just be whoever u want, i just ask u play as a female\n\nDm me and we can chat where we can rp on discord","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"KikRoleplay","subreddit_id":"t5_3g4xs","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/KikRoleplay","subreddit_subscribers":27248,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M4F] Cyberpunk Edgerunners rp","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/KikRoleplay\/comments\/xsh9ur\/m4f_cyberpunk_edgerunners_rp\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I've always been a good (Christian) girl, I go to church three times a week, twice on Sunday and every Wednesday Night.\nWednesdays we had youth group, but I recently switched over to the \"Christ in College\" class for older kids. (I guess kids isn't the right word, but I still feel like and call myself one so I'll use it) \n\nFor some context, I'm 18 as of April, very petite about 5'5 with long black hair, and very pale skin.\nMy eyes are blueish grey (depending on the light). \nI'm also a B cup, but I sometimes don't wear bras or bralettes. (Remember this) \n\nThe class is about 25 people, most of whom I know and see at church all the time. I joined with 3 others a few weeks ago when school started back up. \n\nI normally keep to myself, but when I joined the new class with some new faces and people who didn't have an already made opinion of me, I wanted to make more of myself.\nI started dressing up for the Wednesday classes, wearing makeup, and talking more.\nIt felt good.\nWednesday I wore a red sweater (it's always cold in the Church), knee length white skirt, white pantyhose, brown boots, and a black belt around the waist. \n\nClass is normally three parts; a game, food, then reading\/a lesson.\nEach part is normally a half hour, and after the lesson is over some of us stay around and just play games and hang out.\nWell, the game was mad house dodge ball.\nA constant-motion never-ending game with two teams. \n\nMy team lost, but it was still fun.\nI'm very competitive tho, and I played hard.\nBy the time it was over and we were all in line for food I was tired and mildly sweaty.\nOur leader (Pastor Matt), began his lesson while we were eating. The whole time one kid (named Bryson) kept looking at me, and it was obvious where he was looking.\nI looked down and to my horror, I had boob sweat. It wasn't bad, just two dark spots under my bust. But it was there, clear as day. And worse, my nipples were also showing through my sweater, again not crazy bad, but evident nonetheless. \n\nI was so embarrassed, I just melted into my seat and fiddled with my skirt making sure it was appropriate.\nThe lesson flew by, but I hardly got any of it.\nAfter it was over I went to a friend of mine (Bri) and asked her to text me her notes later.\nShe was(is) always so organized I knew I'd get something good from her.\nWhile talking to her I see Bryson out of the corner of my eye, still staring at me.\nHe comes up as soon as I'm done to tell me that \"I need to wear a bra\", and that I was \"taking his eyes off God.\"\nI was amazed at his guts, but knew in my heart he was right. \n\nI went to find Matt just before leaving to quickly apologize and tell him it was a good lesson.\nHe was in the kitchen cleaning up so I asked if he needed help, he said yes and that he was meaning to talk to me about something anyways.\nMy heart sank.\nI felt I knew what he was gonna say before he even said it.\nBut his words surprised me, he asked if I was \"wearing panties?\"\nMy mind went blank but then I told him honestly, \"No, just my pantyhose\"\nHe smiled and said \"And that's normal Violet, most women don't wear underwear with pantyhose, and that's okay...\nIt's the same with your bra,\nIf there's a verse in the Bible about needing to wear a bra I sure haven't seen it\"\nI was stunned and just stood in silence saying nothing.\n\"Here, come here,\" He said as he was waving his arms over for a hug. \n\nI was so confused, how did he know to say that? Was he right? What should I do?\nI felt so lost, I just went up to him and hugged him.\nAs he was holding me close I closed my eyes and relaxed.\nHe smelled nice.\nHis big arms keeping me safe, I'd never felt that way except with my dad. \n\nAll of a sudden he moved his hand up from my back up to my neck, he traces a line down my back and then up again before putting his hand under my neck. Lifting my head to his, I open my eyes and smile.\n\"God made you a woman of amazing beauty, I'll worship you as I would all his perfect creation.\"\nAs he finishes that thought, his other hand finds my breast and pinches my nipple through my shirt. \n\nThe touch was electric, I gasped. It felt good, but I knew it was wrong.\nI started to back away, but he still had a hand on my neck.\nHe squeezed and moved his other hand around my back, pulling me into him.\nMy breath was caught in my throat.\nHe smiled and whispered into my ear, \"God rewards his people right?\" \n\"Y-yy-ye-es,\" I said catching more of my breath as he loosed his grip slightly, I was starting to cry. \n\"Would you dare deprive me of His reward?\" He asked.\nI shook my head no.\nHe smiled again and kissed the top of my head, \"good girl\"\nThe feeling I had was so intense, but I felt good despite my confusion.\nI smiled and wiped my tears with my sleeve.\nI was feeling heat all over my body. \n\nHe pulled away and told me to stay there then left out into the rest of the church.\nI was left there thinking over what I wanted to do, over what just happened.\nIt was a lot, but I decided he was right, I was going to reward him.\nThe thought made me laugh as I came up with a plan, it felt so naughty.\nI went behind the counter and took off my boots, pantyhose, and belt.\nThe lights in the other rooms were turning off through the doorway.\nHe came back shortly and said he locked the doors and everyone was gone now.\nI smirked and looked him in the eyes. Just before I started with my plan he asked \"are you sure you want to do this V?\"\nStepping from behind the counter holding my pantyhose I told him, \"yes\" \n\nAll things considered, I was still very modest at the moment. My womanhood was warm and damp, and I was feeling the need to be touched, filled, and embraced.\nBut all Matt saw was a petite teen girl with runny makeup forcing a smile as she held her freshly worn pantyhose.\nMy body was mostly hidden from him as I still had on the sweater and skirt.\nHe was slow to remedy that. \n\nThe first thing he did was grab the garment from my hand, he brought them up to his nose and inhaled deeply.\nA moan escaped him. I giggled and grabbed his hand, lifting it to my breast.\nHe took it into his hand greedily, groping and feeling my chest. He was rubbing me all over, pulling me close, and squeezing my butt with my chest pressed into his.\nI gasped and moaned as he felt me.\nI kissed his neck\/chest and wished I was taller so I could reach his face.\nHe reached up under my skirt and touched my slit lightly.\nIt was on fire, I moaned more and started to cry again.\nIt was all so much, moving so fast.\nI think I came, my breaths were hard, heavy, and fast. \n\nBut then the worst happened.\nMy phone rang and based on the tone, I knew who it was.\nMy dad... \n\nEnd of pt1,\nThat all happened Wednesday, and some more happened after that, and again today (Friday)\nWe plan to meet again Sunday, if y'all like I'll share more.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"sexstories","subreddit_id":"t5_2qt19","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/sexstories","subreddit_subscribers":401244,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I (F18) got touched by my pastor (M27)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.92,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/sexstories\/comments\/xshb0c\/i_f18_got_touched_by_my_pastor_m27\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

My period has been very late ever since I got covid February or this year…my doctor told me this was common and many other women experienced the same issue. However… I have not gotten my period since july 30th. Throughout August, i took many pregnancy tests that resulted in a negative result. Last weekend I went on an all girls party trip and took one the night before… negative. However, when I got home I took two more as I was still concerned about not getting my period. I took another three (which was yesterday)… all positive. However, I took 2 more today and believe I am testing negative? My sister thinks I may be experiencing a chemical pregnancy given that I partied hard during the girls trip. I know it’s impossible to tell with just a reddit post but has anyone experienced a similar thing? What does it mean? I have been experiencing period symptoms (cramps, sore boobs, acne, etc) but the period has yet to arrive. That being said, it would be ideal for me to not be pregnant considering I am only back with my partner after getting over some unfaithfulness… (please don’t judge 😣).\n\nMy ultrasound is on Tuesday and I have another OBGYN appointment on the 17th but I can’t wait that long!

So I did not think any of it. Since mid-August, I have been back home and getting used to my regular schedule again. I do smoke weed and many nights when I do, I get turned on. But I simply can not get there. The nights that I am able to start doing things alone, midway I just start feeling nothing. I want to, but I just can not get there. It just doesn't feel right. I don't know how to explain it. at the moment I do not have a sexual partner so i am only able to compare how masturbating feels now compared to before birth control.

My name is Anthony, and I'm looking for a cis F little, age 20-35, in the US or Canada (preferably in the southeast US). But please don't call me \"Daddy\" right away. I want the title to mean something, and I'd rather earn it over time as an emotional connection develops. Likewise, I won't use any titles quickly.\n\nMy ideal girl is an ABDL (most preferred), or into wetting herself. Accident-prone or even incontinent girls are welcome too. Basically, I want a very soggy relationship with a wet girl. And I'd adore having to change lots of wet diapers and\/or clothes daily. If any of this resonates with you, maybe I could be your guy.\n\nI also have a physical type in mind. I want you to be shorter than I (I'm 6'). If you're closer to 5', that'd be amazing. I also want you to be smaller than I (I'm 190-195 pounds). If you're small enough to fit in Pullups or Goodnites, that'd be adorably perfect. But, as long as you could comfortably sit in my lap, I'd love that too. And if you have long hair that I could twirl and play with, I'd also adore that.\n\nI'll want the whole DDlg experience too. I want to be immersed in everything girly and Disney, and whatever else you're into too. I love stuffies, onesies, baby bottles, and everything else baby- or little-related.\n\nI try my best to show consistent effort in communication and making time for someone, and want to receive the same effort. If you're not great at conversation, or if you abruptly disappear a lot, or can rarely ever talk for more than a few minutes at a time, then we won't get along well. However, curiosity that leads to thoughtful\/fun questions could easily win my heart and get me to open up. If you're clingy, I'd wish I could hug you tightly and never let you go (not even to let you pee, haha). And if you slip into baby\/little space, I'd encourage you; I'd love baby talk, as long as I can still make out what you're saying.\n\nConnections will start online, but I don't want online-only. I eventually want an offline relationship. I don't want to go longer than several months without an attempt or at least a serious discussion about making a real-life meeting happen. Also, if we reach 1 month of talking, I will want a video call.\n\nTo be extra clear, I'm only looking for connections with long-term potential. I'm not here for short-term play, especially if it leads to ghosting in mere days or less. If you have questions about any of my criteria, then please feel free to ask; I'd gladly clarify anything. But if you know you don't meet my criteria, especially regarding communication and long-term connections, then please don't contact me. I'm also not interested in anyone on another continent, outside my age range, or in a relationship\/dynamic already.\n\nIf this post catches your interest, then maybe you'd enjoy my [bdsmpersonals post](https:\/\/redd.it\/slmewc) too, especially if you're a Disney fan, as I hid 30+ references to Disney songs. It's a much longer version of this post, albeit a bit outdated now since my offline goals for this year did not and will not happen the way I hoped, but everything else I wrote still holds up.\n\nIf I catch your interest, please message or chat me (chat preferred) and tell me something about yourself. Tell me about either your first or favorite stuffy too, so I know you've read this (if somehow you don't have any stuffies, that's fine too—just be honest). I won't want to keep conversations on Reddit for long, however. I'll eventually want to move to any other better app(s).","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ABDLPersonals","subreddit_id":"t5_2vjo1","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ABDLPersonals","subreddit_subscribers":24714,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"34 [M4F] GA daddy dom looking for an ABDL little (online with IRL potential)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ABDLPersonals\/comments\/xshrn5\/34_m4f_ga_daddy_dom_looking_for_an_abdl_little\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}
