Shortly after I noticed that three of my teeth felt loose. I could visibly move them with my tongue and finger, much more than what looks like regular tooth movement. Sometimes my jaw pops and clicks on the right side.\n\nI brought this up with my dentist and he didn't seem concerned and told me tooth movement is fairly normal. I asked him about it a few more times and I got the same answer. About three weeks ago, I visited another dentist at the same clinic and had some x-rays done. Once again, I asked about the loose teeth and he said there was nothing wrong with them, though one felt more loose than the others. I forgot to mention that they sometimes feel... well, weird. It's kind of like a pain but it's not sharp. It doesn't feel like cavity pain.\n\nI will freely admit that I have problems with anxiety and I clench my teeth at night.

Also I'm 6'3 but don't have the most muscles to show for that height. Not scrawny, but not bulky by any means. So here are a few pictures of me.

If my muscle definition is indeed poor, I would like to know work outs I could do to show off a little bit more. My abs are nothing to write home about, but I'm on a strict diet so there's not a lot of fat there. If people would like an ab picture I will supply, but I didn't want to be a douche bag uploading ab pictures, if no one wanted to see.\nFinally the Face, It turns out I'm God awful at taking photos of just my face haha. I wont ever make a good teenage girl unfortunately [3] http://i.imgur.com/fvW1W.jpg  This picture is the one I would like the most criticism for. Give me hell about my eye brows.

If my muscle definition is indeed poor, I would like to know work outs I could do to show off a little bit more. My abs are nothing to write home about, but I'm on a strict diet so there's not a lot of fat there. If people would like an ab picture I will supply, but I didn't want to be a douche bag uploading ab pictures, if no one wanted to see. \n\nFinally the Face, It turns out I'm God awful at taking photos of just my face haha.

Being a highschooler, I find myself floating away from the crowd fairly often. I could care less about highschool, but when I get to college this summer, I want to walk into it confident and feeling and looking good. That is why I picked up my copy of \"Rules Of The Game\" If you all haven't read it, I would suggest it.

Day 5 is the day where you take an insecurity about yourself and change it, such as going with a new hairstyle, changing your wardrobe, or tanning. Honestly, anything you could think of that makes you feel mediocre compared to other guys. Not to be cocky, but I&amp;#39;ve always considered myself as being an attractive guy, my downfall comes from more social awkwardness than anything, however there isn&amp;#39;t anyone out there who doesn&amp;#39;t have their imperfections, and I would love to pinpoint mine and take them out. I feel like the one I truly have a problem with is bushy eye brows. I don&amp;#39;t have a unibrow, but my eye brows are really bushy, and girls and guys have pointed that out to me before. Also I&amp;#39;m 6&amp;#39;3 but don&amp;#39;t have the most muscles to show for that height. Not scrawny, but not bulky by any means. So here are a few pictures of me.

Perhaps because I wasted so much of my twenties.\n\nI am not really interested in telling you my life story, but to fully appreciate my situation I feel the need to paint you a picture.\n\nI have been depressed for a long time, I have never sought help because I cannot afford it and I don't really know how to seek it otherwise. The depression comes and goes, without that dark cloud over my head I am typically a well rounded happy social person. I have some issues though. For starters, I weight between 450 and 500lbs depending on what time of day it is. No exercise, slow metabolism, consume too much liquid sugar, some days I don't eat others I eat too much. I have been big for a long time, at least 15 years, but it didn't start getting obscene till after my dad died. Who was killed in a standoff with police in 2002 at 48 years of age. The last 10 years things haven't gotten better, despite some improvements that never seem to stick. The lack of stability has made it really hard to concentrate on this personal goal over simply surviving.\n\nI didn't graduate even high school, I spent way too much time fucking off in class (I could pass tests but coursework/homework seemed to require too much effort) I left after 10th grade, went right to community college a week later, got a GED and started taking classes. The ability to ditch class and give zero fucks seemed to be too tempting to resist. I failed at that too. Subsequently I do not have a very good resume.\n\nI meet a girl a few couple years ago and suffice to say it didn't work out, she had/has mental issues and refuses to seek help. That relationship took me from Seattle to Austin to San Diego, put me thousands MORE dollars in debt, and I ended up with her two cats, which she cannot take because she lives with my roommates girlfriends  millionaire husband now, in NY. (yes, I said that right). I should also mention my ex has a husband as well.\n\nWhen things went to shit with her, I came back from Cali, packed her stuff and my stuff into a storage locker and lived with family with her cats as I had no job. I ended up getting my job back and decided to pretty much start fresh with my current roommate in a pretty decent place. Things seemed pretty stable for a couple months, till he got back together with his ex (the wife of the guy in NY my ex is with) and now has decided he wants out of the lease and I essentially have 30 days to find roommates, or pack my shit and move too.\n\nHere is the thing about my job now. Its pretty much a system admin/marketing/maintenance position. I am getting paid as a contractor though, so I have no benefits and no job security. Also I have to pay taxes, which I have not done in 3 years and the IRS is starting to get pissy about it. I probably owe them 20Gs. Right now I cant really afford to make ends meet.\n\nI have more thousands in medical bills, mostly from ER visits because my teeth are destroyed courtesy of all that sugar (Thanks Mt Dew) and not brushing frequently enough. I brush regularly now, its just the damage is done. Last week I was in the ER 3 times, as an infection started to spread across my face, its a week later and my face is still numb. I honestly do not know if the feeling is going to come back now.\n\nI really fell in love with SoCal while I was there, the beaches, the warmth, the weed and the food. It felt a lot like paradise and all I can really think about is how I want to get back to that. I have become delusional thinking it will be awesome and perfect. Even have considered selling everything I own, re-homing the pets and getting in the car and starting fresh. Put myself in some sort of sink or swim situation I feel I need to force myself to be less lazy and more motivated. Aside from my little location preference every morning I wake with the strong desire to change, to be exited about something, to meet new people and experience life in new ways. Regardless of my poor outlook now, I want to do something amazing. If I got on the right path now and lost a bunch of weight, I think that with the damage I have already done to my body my life is most likely half over.\n\nThe point here is, I feel like I lack direction, ambition and motivation. There is no passion, I have nothing to be exited about and the clock is ticking. In terms of my time left alive and what exactly I am going to do in 30 days, and well beyond that.\n\n","domain":"self.WTF","num_comments":4,"likes":null,"clicked":false,"thumbnail":"default","saved":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh61","ups":3,"approved_by":null,"score":0,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I posted this in Ask Reddit last night and I got a few good comments, but  was hoping to hear from a few more people and was told that cross posting this to here would gain a bit more attention.

Feel free to ask me questions pertaining to my life if it helps you give me some sort of advice.\n\n\n\nAfter reading the “Any Redditors 40+ living the life they imagined at 20?” thread, I’m looking for some advice on my situation. I am 19 years old and stuck at a sort of “crossroad” in life. So if anyone (young or old) has advice for me, I would greatly appreciate it. I apologize for the wall of text so I’ll include a short tldr at the bottom.\n\n\n\nFirst, I’m just going to share some history. Ever since I was a child, I’ve always had a huge passion for music. To me, my passion is much more than the typical persons \"omg music is my life\". I got my first drum set at the age of 15. I was completely in love with it. I had no interest in lessons. I simply would play along with my favorite songs at the time. After 3 years of practicing day after day, I finally met a similar minded guitarist to jam with. We shared the same passion for music, same style of music and so on. After jamming together for a few months and writing a few songs, we found a vocalist and started a band. Honestly, the GREATEST feeling in my life to this point is playing shows for other people that enjoyed our music. I'm usually a pretty shy person. I never will just start moving or letting lose at a party or anything (unless I’m drunk of course). But playing music, it takes over my body. I completely let loose and it’s the greatest feeling ever. The same goes for when I go to shows. The composition of the instruments put together just fills my body with an unexplainable energy. With that being said, there is nothing more fulfilling to me than writing music and performing it for other people to feel the same way I feel when I hear it.\n\n\n\nBut now here's my issue. My family is pretty successful I guess you would say. Most of my cousins and other relatives have all gone to a decent college and are making $60,000 their first year out of college. No one in my family has any job tied to music. So after graduating high school with a proficient understanding of math and computers, I was basically \"forced\" to go to college. Currently I am studying Computer Science at a 2 year college with supposed plans to transfer to a 4 year afterwards and complete a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. The problem is I can't see myself living that life. The thought of going through my life and working a job that I don't completely love and enjoy is kind of depressing to me. I have a small amount of time on this planet, and to me, I can’t see myself wasting it by working a job that I don’t truly enjoy. I want to pursue my dreams and pursue happiness in life. My dream life would be to write music and tour around the world playing it for other people. After that phase of my life dies off, I would love to possibly open up a venue or get some kind of job in the music industry. I truly believe in myself and my abilities to do this. I have always been a creative person and talented in most things that I do. I do realize that the music industry is incredibly tough to get known and actually make a living off of it, especially in the type of music that I play and listen to (indie/mathcore/progressive rock/post-hardcore/metal). I am not a materialistic type of person. I can see myself living in an apartment with little needs for fancy cars and nice everything. Those things don’t bring any true happiness to me. There are many bands and artists that have lived this life and inspire me greatly.\nAnyways, I guess what I’m asking advice for is what I should do with my life right now. The reason I don’t enjoy school is because I know that it’s just leading to more schooling that will lead to a career that I don’t enjoy. The way I see it, I basically have two options. I can work hard to finish my Computer Science degree and obtain a job in that field, while playing music as a hobby on the side. Or I can finish my associate’s degree while working a side job to live off of for the time being, and completely dedicate my life to writing music and all of the things involved with it (promoting the band, playing shows, getting signed, etc). I just don’t want to go through with one and end up completely regretting it, even though I can’t see myself regretting pursuing my dreams.\n\n\n\nTLDR: I am 19 years old with a burning passion for music. I truly believe in myself and my abilities to write and perform music for a living. I am going to school right now for computer science, but I can’t see myself living that life. I want to pursue my dreams and pursue happiness, and that type of career doesn’t truly bring me either. So I can keep going to school, finish my bachelor’s degree, and get a career in programming while playing music on the side as a hobby.

I have been putting this off for too long now.\n\nFor those short on time I'll add a TL:DR at the bottom.\n\nI am a 21 year old Biological Male, serving in the US Army. This is my story, and this is where I ask for your help.\n\nSince my childhood I've know something about myself was \"different\" than most of the people around me. I don't think I have *ever* felt comfortable with my body. One of my earliest childhood memories take place in a shower, I'm 4 or 5 years old, still young enough to be being bathed by my mother. I know our bodies are different. Something is wrong, because even then, as a child, I knew mine should be like hers. So I reach down and *adjust* as necessary, \"Look Mommy, I'm just like you\" I say with a true honest smile.\n\nSome time later as a pre-teen my emotions start to catch up with me. Family difficulties, legal problems, social services, foster care, and other traumatic life events racked my world. I have pretty much always been a odd boy. Never really making friends, never enjoying what the other boys find happiness in. I liked being left alone to my thoughts, I loved to imagine a different world for myself. I started to sink into depression, and isolation, soon I had an eating disorder, next I started self harming.\n\nI did my best in high school. I hide well among the crowds. Stayed positive, worked to better my future. I made some friends, tried to fit in, worked my damnest to find a sport or hobby that fulfilled me. Nothing filled the gap inside me. I held my life together not for myself anymore, but for others. By 15 I had almost given up on ever finding happiness, I couldn't figure out what was missing in life.\n\nSlowly I found myself being more and more interested in stereotypically \"feminine\" things. It didn't bother me, it did the opposite, it made me happy. I now lived a secret life, by day I was the stern masculine high school athlete, by night I wrote poems, listened to love songs, real romantic novels, and dreamed of the day I'd find a magical way to wake up from the dream world I lived in.\nI didn't know a thing. My knowledge of LGBT was next to none. I had no notion of transgender, HRT, SRS, anything outside the *norms*.\n\nI don't know how it came up but I remember my parents telling me the origin of my name. They told me they had decided on names before they knew my sex, \"William if it's a boy, Veronica if it's a girl.\" I *feel* like a Veronica... It brings me to tears thinking how close I was.\n\nA couple at my highschool changed my views on everything. Two girls, in love, a happy highschool couple.

I have been putting this off for too long now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those short on time I&amp;#39;ll add a TL:DR at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a 21 year old Biological Male, serving in the US Army. This is my story, and this is where I ask for your help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since my childhood I&amp;#39;ve know something about myself was &amp;quot;different&amp;quot; than most of the people around me. I don&amp;#39;t think I have &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; felt comfortable with my body. One of my earliest childhood memories take place in a shower, I&amp;#39;m 4 or 5 years old, still young enough to be being bathed by my mother. I know our bodies are different. Something is wrong, because even then, as a child, I knew mine should be like hers. So I reach down and &lt;em&gt;adjust&lt;/em&gt; as necessary, &amp;quot;Look Mommy, I&amp;#39;m just like you&amp;quot; I say with a true honest smile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some time later as a pre-teen my emotions start to catch up with me. Family difficulties, legal problems, social services, foster care, and other traumatic life events racked my world. I have pretty much always been a odd boy. Never really making friends, never enjoying what the other boys find happiness in. I liked being left alone to my thoughts, I loved to imagine a different world for myself. I started to sink into depression, and isolation, soon I had an eating disorder, next I started self harming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did my best in high school. I hide well among the crowds. Stayed positive, worked to better my future. I made some friends, tried to fit in, worked my damnest to find a sport or hobby that fulfilled me. Nothing filled the gap inside me. I held my life together not for myself anymore, but for others. By 15 I had almost given up on ever finding happiness, I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out what was missing in life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slowly I found myself being more and more interested in stereotypically &amp;quot;feminine&amp;quot; things. It didn&amp;#39;t bother me, it did the opposite, it made me happy. I now lived a secret life, by day I was the stern masculine high school athlete, by night I wrote poems, listened to love songs, real romantic novels, and dreamed of the day I&amp;#39;d find a magical way to wake up from the dream world I lived in.\nI didn&amp;#39;t know a thing. My knowledge of LGBT was next to none. I had no notion of transgender, HRT, SRS, anything outside the &lt;em&gt;norms&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how it came up but I remember my parents telling me the origin of my name. They told me they had decided on names before they knew my sex, &amp;quot;William if it&amp;#39;s a boy, Veronica if it&amp;#39;s a girl.&amp;quot; I &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like a Veronica... It brings me to tears thinking how close I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple at my highschool changed my views on everything. Two girls, in love, a happy highschool couple. Something clicked in my mind when I saw them. they were both girls but it didn&amp;#39;t matter! what the world around them said didn&amp;#39;t matter, they were happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began to explore myself and grown.

I hold a 3.89 GPA in my MBA program.  I'm still attending college because I spent four years in the military.\n\nI mention these things because when people say they are at 900 ELO I immediately think they are either stupid or bad at video games.  I automatically assume they are not smart enough to do things like ward, counterpick, and evaluate their mistakes after games.  I also assume that if this is not the case they simply lack the hand-eye coordination to play properly.  I do not feel I have any of these negative qualities.\n\nYet no matter what I do I fail constantly.  If you read my post history, I recently had a 26 game win streak.  20 normals and 6 ranked.  Almost all of them were with Yorick.  Last night I decided to queue ranked and got solo top both games with Yorick, my strongest character.  \n\nI went 0/4/0 vs Fioria in the first game, and 0/4/0 vs Nasus in the second.  The Fioria game ended at 20, the Nasus game I eventually ended with positive KDR, but my team lost and I obviously failed laning.  \n\nDuring the Fioria game I was beating her up so bad.  It wasn't even close.  I was winning in CS too.  Malphite came up to gank me at the perfect time and I was running Teleport + Ignight, so without flash I died.  I still felt okay, I was winning in CS and it was just one death.  I proceeded to beat Fioria up again, this time with proper ward placement for Malphite.  Malphite comes up to hold the lane while Fioria B's, and I just under estimated how much dmg the two of them could do when she got back and they turret dove me.  Third death I was beating up Fioria again and I turret dove her and failed.  Fourth death she was just so much higher in gold and lvl than me she just solo'd me.\n\nMy jungle never came up once, but I didn't complain.  I understand at 900 ELO a good player could just handle it by himself.  How do you people do it?  I just don't understand.\n\nIn the Nasus game it was a similar deal.  I was crushing him.  I warded properly, avoided the first gank.  Avoided second gank.  My ward ran out and Akali (mid) came up and I died.  I start beating up Nasus again, I avoid another jungle gank but shen teleports in and snags me, I die 3v1.  The next death was another jungle + Akali + Nasus 3v1, and my final death was Nasus being too far ahead for me to kill.\n\nIn both of these games if it was 1v1 I would have won with 0 deaths.  I was better at top lane than both of these people, with an easier/stronger laning character.  It was the result of our surroundings that I died and they did not, but I know a good player would have compensated for the shortcomings of his teammates.  I just don't get how.\n\nWhen you beat someone up top lane and as a result the lane gets pushed, but you didnt get a ward on your first buy, what do you do?  Do you farm at their turret without a ward?  Do you let all that CS and experience go to waste?  Do you just passively farm and try to not have your lane pushed?  \n\nWhen you have two people pushing your turret but you avoided the gank, yet you are so low you are at risk to be tower dove, what do you do?  B and let the tower go?  Try to fend them off?  What's the secret?\n\nIn my normal game prior to these two fails I went 14/7/10.  How do you guys do it?  I am obviously missing something.

I know it’s different for everyone but when I told my friends it was rather “blunt” to say the least, it was because I knew if I tried to do some longwinded speech I wouldn’t be able to say it at all. But for my parents I don’t want it to be blunt as I don’t think it will help the situation in any positive manner. I am kind of trying to make myself tell them by the end of the week (possibly the start of next week) which I know isn’t very far away, but not telling them is literally making me feel awful, and not being able to be true to myself in front of all the people I see every day just feels like I am lying to them constantly :( Any advice is much appreciated :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1330622492,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}
