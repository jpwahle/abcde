Since March 26, I&amp;#39;ve started my job (as a golf caddie; which I enjoy every weekend when I get the chance) that I do every year that prolongs throughout the summer. Since then I&amp;#39;ve made plans to go to Cedar Point, I have all money ready and all I need is to figure out who I want to go with me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, I&amp;#39;ve continued to be depressed and I&amp;#39;ve only concluded onto two things. First, I&amp;#39;m lonely relationship wise, and being closeted I don&amp;#39;t want to attempt to be outed. Second, I&amp;#39;m lonely in friendship, I have plenty of friends, but since my mother gained custody of me I&amp;#39;m 30 minutes away from the school of where I go to, I don&amp;#39;t get a chance to hang out with them, and then I&amp;#39;m mostly never invited into places. Plus, I haven&amp;#39;t seen things develop out the way I want to. The trip I&amp;#39;ve planned to Cedar Point is still on, but only Saturday did I learn that the guy who I have a, somewhat, crush on and was most likely was going to invite, isn&amp;#39;t a fan of roller coasters, that was a huge downer and hasn&amp;#39;t helped. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never been in a relationship (hetero or same-sex) and I have literally no ability to approach a guy, and &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be extremely sub-conscious, along with that I have no idea how to stop being depressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any idea on what I should do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: Read the damn wall or get out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1335919535,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

There's no address, so I use Craigslist to get in touch with the poster, and I receive this email:\n\n\n&gt; Hello, Thanks for taking the time to look at my property.My name is Cindy Wilson,I'm 38years old,I'm the owner of this condo(2 bedrooms,2 bathrooms, 1247 square footage).It's located in1250 S Michigan Ave, Chicago, IL 60605.The unit is equipped with recessed lighting, central air and heat, the condo come with two parking spots,a storage unit where you can deposit my furniture (if you don't like it and you want use your furniture),there is also a linen closet, and most importantly, a new front loading stacked washer and drier.Pets allowed.I've moved to United Kingdom with my job and decided to rent it because the rent is very expensive here.The price is so low because I'm here and is very hard to find a tenant.I can rent you the condo for min. 1 month and max. 6 years(or more).I really want to find a good and responsible tenant for it, and I hope that you can send me some personal information about yourself.The rent for whole the condo for 1 month is $800.00 including all utilities(water,electricity, internet, cable, parking , airconditioning, fireplace, dishwasher, garbage) and the security deposit is $800.00 (you'll get the deposit back at your departure-or you can use it to pay your last month of rent) and I want to receive the money monthly in my bank account. You can move in the condo in the same day when you receive the keys. The only problem is that I`m the only person who has the keys and I have nobody in United States that could show you the condo. In order to check it, see if you like it(I'm sure that you'll love it), you need to receive the keys and the contract.If you want to rent the condo, please e-mail me back and I will explain you how the payment and shipping will take place! Thank you\n\nHmm. Okay. I responded and asked how I can see the apartment before agreeing to rent or pay anything. She sends me this:\n\n&gt;Thank you for your reply. Before going further with anything I must tell you that for payments I will use the eBay Company, they will secure the transaction of payments. I will open a CASE ID# at eBay Company for this transaction and I will give them your full name, shipping info, phone# and indicate you as my tenant. After that, they will contact you with the payment details, and they will ask you to send them a refundable deposit, $1,600.00 in 24 hours(the money will be for the first month of rent + the security deposit). After they receive your deposit, they will notify me immediately to start the shipping of the keys and the contract. You will receive a tracking number in max 24 hours after they receive your deposit. The keys will reach to you in 3-4 days. After you'll receive the keys and the contract, the 14 days of inspection period will start( you'll have 14 days to see the condo, read the contract, decide if you keep the condo or not).After the inspection you will contact them and tell your decision: TAKE THE CONDO or NOT TAKE THE CONDO! In case you'll take it you'll have to send them a copy of the contract signed by you and they will release the money to me, if not you'll have to send them the contract unsigned and they will refund your money($1,600.00), the contract and the keys will be shipped back at my expenses! I will pay the shipping and you'll have to pay the money transfer fee for the refundable deposit. Once again: 1. If you have the money $1,600.00 and if you want to rent it send me your full name, your shipping address and your phone# 2. I will open a CASE ID# at eBay Company for this transaction , and I will give them your info, and indicate you as my tenant. 3. After that, they will contact you with the payment details(you'll have to send them $1,600.00 via money transfer in the next 24 hours-you'll need cash) 4.

There&amp;#39;s no address, so I use Craigslist to get in touch with the poster, and I receive this email:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hello, Thanks for taking the time to look at my property.My name is Cindy Wilson,I&amp;#39;m 38years old,I&amp;#39;m the owner of this condo(2 bedrooms,2 bathrooms, 1247 square footage).It&amp;#39;s located in1250 S Michigan Ave, Chicago, IL 60605.The unit is equipped with recessed lighting, central air and heat, the condo come with two parking spots,a storage unit where you can deposit my furniture (if you don&amp;#39;t like it and you want use your furniture),there is also a linen closet, and most importantly, a new front loading stacked washer and drier.Pets allowed.I&amp;#39;ve moved to United Kingdom with my job and decided to rent it because the rent is very expensive here.The price is so low because I&amp;#39;m here and is very hard to find a tenant.I can rent you the condo for min. 1 month and max. 6 years(or more).I really want to find a good and responsible tenant for it, and I hope that you can send me some personal information about yourself.The rent for whole the condo for 1 month is $800.00 including all utilities(water,electricity, internet, cable, parking , airconditioning, fireplace, dishwasher, garbage) and the security deposit is $800.00 (you&amp;#39;ll get the deposit back at your departure-or you can use it to pay your last month of rent) and I want to receive the money monthly in my bank account. You can move in the condo in the same day when you receive the keys. The only problem is that I`m the only person who has the keys and I have nobody in United States that could show you the condo. In order to check it, see if you like it(I&amp;#39;m sure that you&amp;#39;ll love it), you need to receive the keys and the contract.If you want to rent the condo, please e-mail me back and I will explain you how the payment and shipping will take place! Thank you&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hmm. Okay. I responded and asked how I can see the apartment before agreeing to rent or pay anything. She sends me this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your reply. Before going further with anything I must tell you that for payments I will use the eBay Company, they will secure the transaction of payments. I will open a CASE ID# at eBay Company for this transaction and I will give them your full name, shipping info, phone# and indicate you as my tenant. After that, they will contact you with the payment details, and they will ask you to send them a refundable deposit, $1,600.00 in 24 hours(the money will be for the first month of rent + the security deposit). After they receive your deposit, they will notify me immediately to start the shipping of the keys and the contract. You will receive a tracking number in max 24 hours after they receive your deposit. The keys will reach to you in 3-4 days. After you&amp;#39;ll receive the keys and the contract, the 14 days of inspection period will start( you&amp;#39;ll have 14 days to see the condo, read the contract, decide if you keep the condo or not).After the inspection you will contact them and tell your decision: TAKE THE CONDO or NOT TAKE THE CONDO! In case you&amp;#39;ll take it you&amp;#39;ll have to send them a copy of the contract signed by you and they will release the money to me, if not you&amp;#39;ll have to send them the contract unsigned and they will refund your money($1,600.00), the contract and the keys will be shipped back at my expenses! I will pay the shipping and you&amp;#39;ll have to pay the money transfer fee for the refundable deposit. Once again: 1. If you have the money $1,600.00 and if you want to rent it send me your full name, your shipping address and your phone# 2. I will open a CASE ID# at eBay Company for this transaction , and I will give them your info, and indicate you as my tenant. 3. After that, they will contact you with the payment details(you&amp;#39;ll have to send them $1,600.00 via money transfer in the next 24 hours-you&amp;#39;ll need cash) 4.

Where to begin, I am a 21 year old Male who has worked with his father in a road construction company for 6 years of my life. I graduated school in 2007 at 16 years old and was told I may save up money and furniture to have a better start in life. I never once wanted to be affiliated with road construction but since it was my fathers company and one by one he was losing men I decided to help, that and I was sort of forced to. For 2 school summers and 5 years of full time I have gotten up at 5:30 in the morning and returned later on around 5-6ish if its a good day. To make sure my body was in peak condition so I could offer up the best labor I rarely ever went out to bars and clubs with my friends and because I stayed at home to make sure I could get proper rest I was single for 4 of those 5 full years. \n\n   Since then, I have learned how to operate heavy machinery, being backhoes, gradars, dump trucks, pavers and learned to become a fine grade specialist and what ever else I was asked to do to help the company. In the process I have replaced everyone my Father has hired so instead of him paying a full salary for 4 guys, he can now pay a descent salary of $12 an hour after taxes for me. Now I'm not completely alone, my younger brother decided to join about a yearish ago. During these years of work I have come to find that I damaged my spine and now it's partially curved so I have to consult a chiropractor every thursday.\n\n   It's not all bad news, I am a giant geek so while I stayed home awaiting my 10 o'clock curfew I would play games, a fuck ton of them. I had lots of fun playing them and competing online, my brother actually got to become a halo 3 pro during this time for a couple of months till he decided to quit for work. To be honest they were the only thing I looked forward to besides my brother and girlfriend now. This year, around late January, I made a decision to quit working with my Father and try to get my advanced Math in highschool on the side so I can take a Co-op computer science course and get a career in a field that excites and interests me. To be blunt, the conversation concerning my resignation did not go over smoothly but I expected it wouldn't. I graduated with a grade 10 math (that's all that is required in Canada) and now I'm working my way up through Grade 10 Advance Math, Grade 11 and Grade 11 Advance Math all to be finished around July. Thankfully through plenty of hard work and determination I have completed 2 of those courses and am now working my way up Grade11 Adv. Math.\n\n   Hopefully you're still with me because this is my last hope for some answers, some guidance. My parents go to work and around the same time I begin my Math studies via books I do at home. In the 10-12 hours till they return I try to keep the house as clean as possible (washing dishes, washing their and my clothes and taking care of 2 dogs) I cannot make a mess in the kitchen and cannot leave a single dish in the sink( I would only put my dishes in the sink if the dishwasher was full) which only forced me to keep them in my room until the coast is clear so I don't get yelled at. I am the type of person who needs to keep things clean so keeping dishes in my room aggravates me a lot and the worst part is they do the exact same thing they tell me not to do except for them it seems to be ok. \n\n   If my wall of text is sounding bland I apologize because I am literally defeated and can't take this anymore. My parents have decided to build our family a dream house, big house on the hillside overlooking the river. Through out my life we have only lived in a small little bungalow so this sounded fantastic! Or so I thought. Our working hours are essentially the same except for the fact the were doing obviously totally different things, the problem is they never see me work on my studies, my parents think I sit in my room and play games all day and simply eat all there food. I have confronted them a couple of times and told them that I buy my own foods (I am allergic to gluten so I need special gluten-free foods) because they never get food for me ,which is fine I'm 21, and have shown them the stacks of books I've completed and the exams I've done that have come back as 80-90% almost every time (which tears me up to how a simple little road construction bumpkin who has been out of school so far has achieved these goals) but still they ignore what I say. It's ok I can let that slide and just pretend with them. I have helped them on the new house a couple of times but because of my schedule I don't have much time to help although today I did. While working I found out that the room they built for me, which I am super grateful for, has no room for some of the thousands of dollars of electronics and furniture I have saved for and bought for my future house. When I asked my Father where I could put my TV and my computer/computer desk, he said, \" I don't know but it looks like you should figure it out fast.\" I stood there shocked, I was told I could buy furniture and save up at home to have a better start in life, now I'm working my way through school to get the career I've dreamed of and they just told me all of that was a lie. I couldn't believe it so I asked him again, my games, my tv, the computer and desk I bought that I'll need for my Computer Science course what do I do with it? Where do I put them? To this, he looked to his new co-worker that replaced me and said in front of me,\" Wow, doesn't my son have it hard? What a hard life?\" My life was just shattered, maybe a little over dramatic but I gave up 6 years of my life for a job that I hated and had no interest in, damaged my spine ,lost connections to friends in the process of not going out and lost a 5 year head start on school where i could have been done and already on my own with a career no less...\n\n   This is what I ask of you reddit. I'm crushed and do not know what to do. The simple answer would be to move out but now I have no income and I have school coming up. From what I've heard and expect Computer Science isn't the easiest course, how do I juggle both? I feel like I gave up so much for my family to have a better company and sacrificed so much and now that they both make a great amount of money to feel very comfortable and they can't help me out to start my life? In no way would I ever expect help to get me started but they told me they would offer any help I need and if staying at home for a few years helped me immensely then no problem. I need to know if I'm a spoiled brat? I am asking too much? I am a horrible son? I get looks and snarks from my parents, my dad mostly, and they tell  their friends about how my brother and I constantly stay in the \"bat cave\" and do nothing all day, we're lazy and useless. I have worked Saturdays and Sundays and never said no or even complained a peep, I have in 6 years never taken a sick day, I have worked 16 hour days and yet still, I say nothing.

Where to begin, I am a 21 year old Male who has worked with his father in a road construction company for 6 years of my life. I graduated school in 2007 at 16 years old and was told I may save up money and furniture to have a better start in life. I never once wanted to be affiliated with road construction but since it was my fathers company and one by one he was losing men I decided to help, that and I was sort of forced to. For 2 school summers and 5 years of full time I have gotten up at 5:30 in the morning and returned later on around 5-6ish if its a good day. To make sure my body was in peak condition so I could offer up the best labor I rarely ever went out to bars and clubs with my friends and because I stayed at home to make sure I could get proper rest I was single for 4 of those 5 full years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have learned how to operate heavy machinery, being backhoes, gradars, dump trucks, pavers and learned to become a fine grade specialist and what ever else I was asked to do to help the company. In the process I have replaced everyone my Father has hired so instead of him paying a full salary for 4 guys, he can now pay a descent salary of $12 an hour after taxes for me. Now I&amp;#39;m not completely alone, my younger brother decided to join about a yearish ago. During these years of work I have come to find that I damaged my spine and now it&amp;#39;s partially curved so I have to consult a chiropractor every thursday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not all bad news, I am a giant geek so while I stayed home awaiting my 10 o&amp;#39;clock curfew I would play games, a fuck ton of them. I had lots of fun playing them and competing online, my brother actually got to become a halo 3 pro during this time for a couple of months till he decided to quit for work. To be honest they were the only thing I looked forward to besides my brother and girlfriend now. This year, around late January, I made a decision to quit working with my Father and try to get my advanced Math in highschool on the side so I can take a Co-op computer science course and get a career in a field that excites and interests me. To be blunt, the conversation concerning my resignation did not go over smoothly but I expected it wouldn&amp;#39;t. I graduated with a grade 10 math (that&amp;#39;s all that is required in Canada) and now I&amp;#39;m working my way up through Grade 10 Advance Math, Grade 11 and Grade 11 Advance Math all to be finished around July. Thankfully through plenty of hard work and determination I have completed 2 of those courses and am now working my way up Grade11 Adv. Math.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you&amp;#39;re still with me because this is my last hope for some answers, some guidance. My parents go to work and around the same time I begin my Math studies via books I do at home. In the 10-12 hours till they return I try to keep the house as clean as possible (washing dishes, washing their and my clothes and taking care of 2 dogs) I cannot make a mess in the kitchen and cannot leave a single dish in the sink( I would only put my dishes in the sink if the dishwasher was full) which only forced me to keep them in my room until the coast is clear so I don&amp;#39;t get yelled at. I am the type of person who needs to keep things clean so keeping dishes in my room aggravates me a lot and the worst part is they do the exact same thing they tell me not to do except for them it seems to be ok. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If my wall of text is sounding bland I apologize because I am literally defeated and can&amp;#39;t take this anymore. My parents have decided to build our family a dream house, big house on the hillside overlooking the river. Through out my life we have only lived in a small little bungalow so this sounded fantastic! Or so I thought. Our working hours are essentially the same except for the fact the were doing obviously totally different things, the problem is they never see me work on my studies, my parents think I sit in my room and play games all day and simply eat all there food. I have confronted them a couple of times and told them that I buy my own foods (I am allergic to gluten so I need special gluten-free foods) because they never get food for me ,which is fine I&amp;#39;m 21, and have shown them the stacks of books I&amp;#39;ve completed and the exams I&amp;#39;ve done that have come back as 80-90% almost every time (which tears me up to how a simple little road construction bumpkin who has been out of school so far has achieved these goals) but still they ignore what I say. It&amp;#39;s ok I can let that slide and just pretend with them. I have helped them on the new house a couple of times but because of my schedule I don&amp;#39;t have much time to help although today I did. While working I found out that the room they built for me, which I am super grateful for, has no room for some of the thousands of dollars of electronics and furniture I have saved for and bought for my future house. When I asked my Father where I could put my TV and my computer/computer desk, he said, &amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t know but it looks like you should figure it out fast.&amp;quot; I stood there shocked, I was told I could buy furniture and save up at home to have a better start in life, now I&amp;#39;m working my way through school to get the career I&amp;#39;ve dreamed of and they just told me all of that was a lie. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it so I asked him again, my games, my tv, the computer and desk I bought that I&amp;#39;ll need for my Computer Science course what do I do with it? Where do I put them? To this, he looked to his new co-worker that replaced me and said in front of me,&amp;quot; Wow, doesn&amp;#39;t my son have it hard? What a hard life?&amp;quot; My life was just shattered, maybe a little over dramatic but I gave up 6 years of my life for a job that I hated and had no interest in, damaged my spine ,lost connections to friends in the process of not going out and lost a 5 year head start on school where i could have been done and already on my own with a career no less...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is what I ask of you reddit. I&amp;#39;m crushed and do not know what to do. The simple answer would be to move out but now I have no income and I have school coming up. From what I&amp;#39;ve heard and expect Computer Science isn&amp;#39;t the easiest course, how do I juggle both? I feel like I gave up so much for my family to have a better company and sacrificed so much and now that they both make a great amount of money to feel very comfortable and they can&amp;#39;t help me out to start my life?

Our entire relationship was toxic but I didn't know any better at the time. All of this left me feeling kinda worthless for years. I went from that pretty much right into another LTR and didn't get much learning in the short time I had between the two. Im great with girls when I know them but I've had a hard time approaching girls that I'm not already close to or introduced to. I quit drinking for two years after my son was born because I was into some bad shit with bad people and finally hit my breaking point where I decided I needed to be a better man. I've spent that time cutting toxic people out of my life, save for a few that I can't seem to let go of, and generally trying to become a better person. I've been lurking seddit for almost a year now and slowly putting lessons into play.\n\nMy goals are not just to get laid, but more to being able to approach and meet new people and being a person that's worth getting to know. As I've matured I know that I'm good looking now (still have a hard time saying that),  and when I'm on beat I have some serious swagger. People love me, I'm intelligent and really awesome to be around once I'm comfortable with you. I've been hit on constantly throughout the years and either don't notice or choose to ignore it I guess. My biggest concern is that I live in a smaller town and I fear that fucking up approaches will get blabbed about all over town, but lets see if seddit can help finish making me the man I know I could be. \n\nWent out sat night with a couple buds. Started off with a few beer and some food. Went to the strippers for a bit to play pool and warm up a bit before heading to the bar. One friend bailed but another joined us. So I'm now at the bar 'with' two friends awesome time, ran into alot of old friends, chattin and playin with some girls but I either knew most of these girls or wouldn't have taken them home anyways so it was just good fun. Outside smoking, both my friends there and a few more that I knew, just blew off a random after some light flirting when this girl (an 8 or a 9 wearing this super sexy black dress that stuck to her body in all the right places)  walks out the door, sees me, blows off two good looking guys trying to catch her attention and walks right up to me never breaking eye contact says hi tells me its her bday and asks for a smoke. I oblige wish her a happy bday and go for a hug and she proceeds to call me out by name. I'm shocked a bit and she can see it so she clarifies by telling me where she  knows me from, (I used to own a delivery company that had the work from a restaurant she worked at about two years ago). Says im hot and she always got excited when I came in to pick up orders. Says that the other girls used to come get her so she could talk to me and that they all kinda had crushes on me and repeats that I'm really hot like 3 more times.  (This is where it clicks and I recognize her now and I'm also flabbergasted at how hard she came at me and side tracted by my buddies shitting their pants behind her watching this whole thing go down). I laugh and take her hand and tell her I recognize her but I don't remember her name, she gives it (call her alice for this post) . I smile and while lightly kino with her hand tell her its great to see her again and that I thought she was pretty hot too. She likes the touch doesn't pull away but didn't hear me so I repeat that I thought she was hot too.  She lets go of my hand asks for a lighter, and and says sorry I'm just being honest. I couldnt think of anything to say so i just occupied myself with finding the lighter. As I'm giving her the lighter she jokes and asks if i'd smoke it for her too I respond with a no but i'd gladly smoke with her. I start to back into the street trying to pull her away from the group a bit and she rubs her arms saying she is cold and asks if she could wear my hoody. I take it off and she reaches for it but I pull it away and gesture for her to slip into it while I hold it for her. As she does I kino both hands from her shoulders down her arms to make sure the front was straight (stayed respectfully away from breasts this early in public with lots of eyes on us) and with my left hand I pull her back into me by her hip. She leans into me for a second before turning to face me again and this is where everything starts to pile up on me.\n\nBefore I can re engage convo one of the two guys she originally cold shouldered to talk to me gets her to halfway turn around to respond to a question he asked and my buddy walks up and literally pulls me a few feet away from her. Two things happened here, she completely turns away from me and engages this random who I think she did know from somewhere, and my buddy proceeds to loudly proclaim that \"if I play my cards right I'm taking her home tonight and that's why him and the other buddy moved away \" (now I've watched him screw up approaches for other friends and know that he doesn't help at all so I start trying to brush him off and quiet him down) he gets louder and tells me I'm fucking it up, I tell him to fuck off and I'm trying to get back but he keeps yelling shit that I know she can over hear. Tells me to just walk over and cut between her and this other guy. (I might be wrong for not doing it but I didn't want to be an asshole and i didn't want to end up in a fight either) . I needed my smokes so I reached into the hoody she was still wearing and intentionally put pressure against her body. She didn't resist or pull away. I did it again looking for my phone in the other pocket and this time the guy she was talking to tries to get confrontational with me and says I shouldn't be reaching into her pockets. I said my hoody, my pockets and she really doesn't seem to mind. This pissed him off but I ignored and started up a convo with a girl standing nearby that I knew. (With my buddy still yackin about how I'm fuckin it all up) finished my smoke and decided I really needed a drink and to just change the situation. As I walk by her I touch her arm and hand gesture for drinks as i back away from her and motion for her to follow me. She looked right at me and started to follow and then stopped when the other guy stepped in to block her under the pretense of butting his smoke out. The doorway started to fill up as everyone was suddenly wanting to go inside, he was actively trying to keep her away from me and she took the hoody off and handed it to me awkwardly through the crowd. I could tell she was debating whether to stay or come with me and I suddenly felt really awkward so I latched onto my buddies as they were goin in and walked away from her, drug them to the bar for drinks planning to reopen later. \n\nIll chop most details out of the rest of the night but suffice it to say that the opportunity never presented itself again, couldn't find her when I wanted to chickened out when I could have. Bar was less than an hour from closing I got drunker, ran into her once when I cut through a line at the main bar, but I just pinched her ass as I walked past (total douchebag move I know however she did smile when I looked back before walking outside for another smoke) and then next thing I know the bar was closing and she was gone. I know she didn't go home with the other guy because he was still around giving my the stink eye and puffing himself up like he was gonna start a fight and the girl she was there with was gone as well so I'm assuming they left together. It didn't totally ruin my night I still had fun with people I knew there and to be honest that's all I really wanted from her. Sex would have been nice but I'm more regretful of the missed opportunity to play that interaction out. \n\nLessons I learned : 1) I'm more attractive and fun than I give myself credit for and that conversation really drove that home for me. 2) My good buddy is toxic to my game and I need to learn how to work around that. 3) I really need to stop being in my head and just live in the moment.\n\nSeddit, I give you fresh meat and ask for your pointers and critique. I apologize for any formatting issues but this is posted from my phone and I beg leniency from the hivemind. I've found her on FB and I know she works at a new restaurant.  I'm hesitant to FB her because I keep my account pretty private and with less than 60 friends of whom are all my closest friends family id hate to have to explain not adding her. But I'm hesitant aboit trying to run into her at her work too because, well, its her work. I know she's single now and she has a child that appears to be about 2. What do seddit?\n\nAlso as a final note, I'm in an open relationship. If its this hard just trying to re open her how the hell is it gonna go when I slip in the fact that I have a gf.","domain":"self.seduction","num_comments":4,"likes":null,"clicked":false,"thumbnail":"default","saved":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhrv","ups":1,"approved_by":null,"score":0,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi seddit Im sorry for the length of this but as my first post I really didn&amp;#39;t want to leave anything out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quick bio - I&amp;#39;m 27, never really dated before, I was kind of scrawny with big ugly glasses and of course the first in my age group to start growing copious amounts of thick dark facial and body hair in school and just before graduating got into a 5 yr long relationship with someone who ended it by cheating on me with my best friend, lots.

My biggest concern is that I live in a smaller town and I fear that fucking up approaches will get blabbed about all over town, but lets see if seddit can help finish making me the man I know I could be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Went out sat night with a couple buds. Started off with a few beer and some food. Went to the strippers for a bit to play pool and warm up a bit before heading to the bar. One friend bailed but another joined us. So I&amp;#39;m now at the bar &amp;#39;with&amp;#39; two friends awesome time, ran into alot of old friends, chattin and playin with some girls but I either knew most of these girls or wouldn&amp;#39;t have taken them home anyways so it was just good fun. Outside smoking, both my friends there and a few more that I knew, just blew off a random after some light flirting when this girl (an 8 or a 9 wearing this super sexy black dress that stuck to her body in all the right places)  walks out the door, sees me, blows off two good looking guys trying to catch her attention and walks right up to me never breaking eye contact says hi tells me its her bday and asks for a smoke. I oblige wish her a happy bday and go for a hug and she proceeds to call me out by name. I&amp;#39;m shocked a bit and she can see it so she clarifies by telling me where she  knows me from, (I used to own a delivery company that had the work from a restaurant she worked at about two years ago). Says im hot and she always got excited when I came in to pick up orders. Says that the other girls used to come get her so she could talk to me and that they all kinda had crushes on me and repeats that I&amp;#39;m really hot like 3 more times.  (This is where it clicks and I recognize her now and I&amp;#39;m also flabbergasted at how hard she came at me and side tracted by my buddies shitting their pants behind her watching this whole thing go down). I laugh and take her hand and tell her I recognize her but I don&amp;#39;t remember her name, she gives it (call her alice for this post) . I smile and while lightly kino with her hand tell her its great to see her again and that I thought she was pretty hot too. She likes the touch doesn&amp;#39;t pull away but didn&amp;#39;t hear me so I repeat that I thought she was hot too.  She lets go of my hand asks for a lighter, and and says sorry I&amp;#39;m just being honest. I couldnt think of anything to say so i just occupied myself with finding the lighter. As I&amp;#39;m giving her the lighter she jokes and asks if i&amp;#39;d smoke it for her too I respond with a no but i&amp;#39;d gladly smoke with her. I start to back into the street trying to pull her away from the group a bit and she rubs her arms saying she is cold and asks if she could wear my hoody. I take it off and she reaches for it but I pull it away and gesture for her to slip into it while I hold it for her. As she does I kino both hands from her shoulders down her arms to make sure the front was straight (stayed respectfully away from breasts this early in public with lots of eyes on us) and with my left hand I pull her back into me by her hip. She leans into me for a second before turning to face me again and this is where everything starts to pile up on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I can re engage convo one of the two guys she originally cold shouldered to talk to me gets her to halfway turn around to respond to a question he asked and my buddy walks up and literally pulls me a few feet away from her. Two things happened here, she completely turns away from me and engages this random who I think she did know from somewhere, and my buddy proceeds to loudly proclaim that &amp;quot;if I play my cards right I&amp;#39;m taking her home tonight and that&amp;#39;s why him and the other buddy moved away &amp;quot; (now I&amp;#39;ve watched him screw up approaches for other friends and know that he doesn&amp;#39;t help at all so I start trying to brush him off and quiet him down) he gets louder and tells me I&amp;#39;m fucking it up, I tell him to fuck off and I&amp;#39;m trying to get back but he keeps yelling shit that I know she can over hear. Tells me to just walk over and cut between her and this other guy. (I might be wrong for not doing it but I didn&amp;#39;t want to be an asshole and i didn&amp;#39;t want to end up in a fight either) . I needed my smokes so I reached into the hoody she was still wearing and intentionally put pressure against her body. She didn&amp;#39;t resist or pull away. I did it again looking for my phone in the other pocket and this time the guy she was talking to tries to get confrontational with me and says I shouldn&amp;#39;t be reaching into her pockets. I said my hoody, my pockets and she really doesn&amp;#39;t seem to mind. This pissed him off but I ignored and started up a convo with a girl standing nearby that I knew. (With my buddy still yackin about how I&amp;#39;m fuckin it all up) finished my smoke and decided I really needed a drink and to just change the situation. As I walk by her I touch her arm and hand gesture for drinks as i back away from her and motion for her to follow me. She looked right at me and started to follow and then stopped when the other guy stepped in to block her under the pretense of butting his smoke out. The doorway started to fill up as everyone was suddenly wanting to go inside, he was actively trying to keep her away from me and she took the hoody off and handed it to me awkwardly through the crowd. I could tell she was debating whether to stay or come with me and I suddenly felt really awkward so I latched onto my buddies as they were goin in and walked away from her, drug them to the bar for drinks planning to reopen later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ill chop most details out of the rest of the night but suffice it to say that the opportunity never presented itself again, couldn&amp;#39;t find her when I wanted to chickened out when I could have. Bar was less than an hour from closing I got drunker, ran into her once when I cut through a line at the main bar, but I just pinched her ass as I walked past (total douchebag move I know however she did smile when I looked back before walking outside for another smoke) and then next thing I know the bar was closing and she was gone. I know she didn&amp;#39;t go home with the other guy because he was still around giving my the stink eye and puffing himself up like he was gonna start a fight and the girl she was there with was gone as well so I&amp;#39;m assuming they left together. It didn&amp;#39;t totally ruin my night I still had fun with people I knew there and to be honest that&amp;#39;s all I really wanted from her. Sex would have been nice but I&amp;#39;m more regretful of the missed opportunity to play that interaction out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lessons I learned : 1) I&amp;#39;m more attractive and fun than I give myself credit for and that conversation really drove that home for me. 2) My good buddy is toxic to my game and I need to learn how to work around that. 3) I really need to stop being in my head and just live in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seddit, I give you fresh meat and ask for your pointers and critique. I apologize for any formatting issues but this is posted from my phone and I beg leniency from the hivemind. I&amp;#39;ve found her on FB and I know she works at a new restaurant.  I&amp;#39;m hesitant to FB her because I keep my account pretty private and with less than 60 friends of whom are all my closest friends family id hate to have to explain not adding her. But I&amp;#39;m hesitant aboit trying to run into her at her work too because, well, its her work. I know she&amp;#39;s single now and she has a child that appears to be about 2. What do seddit?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also as a final note, I&amp;#39;m in an open relationship. If its this hard just trying to re open her how the hell is it gonna go when I slip in the fact that I have a gf.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1335913584,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

I have a family history of skin cancer and MS.\n \nThis ~~might be~~ is too long and detailed.  I’m getting a little irritated feeling this way, but wary of going to the doctor unnecessarily. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nFor over a year I have been feeling quite run down.  It started around the time I got a promotion (read: stress) so I brushed it off.  Then, I started losing weight really fast. Between last May and August I went from 175 to 135 without any effort. I knew it wasn't normal, but again attributed it to stress.  \n\nWork calmed down last Fall, but I was still dogging it.  My weight also kept slowly creeping lower despite increasing the amount I ate and decreasing my activity level. I need(ed) naps every day. I figured maybe I was depressed and it was causing physical symptoms.  \n\nI went to a psychiatrist in November who agreed and started me on Wellbutrin. He said it would especially help with my fatigue symptoms. However, he wanted me to get a full physical because my weight loss was a little abnormal for just depression. \n\nMy PCP agreed that the weight loss was troubling. She ordered all sorts of blood work, stool samples, and what not.  During the physical exam she felt an enlarged lymph node behind my ear and thought she felt something on my thyroid.  She ordered an ultrasound of my thyroid.  \n\nIn the first week of December I hear back that the ultrasound showed a small benign colloid cyst on my thyroid.  I also learned that all my blood work etc. came back normal (including thyroid levels).  My PCP wanted me to go see an Endocrinologist even though it seemed like there was nothing wrong with my thyroid just in case.  I took the first appointment that was available for the Endocrinologist my PCP recommended (mid-March).\n \nIn the meantime, the Wellbutrin improved my mood but didn't really effect my energy level or weight.  I did notice that I would get a wicked hangover after only 2 beers.  The doc warned me it wasn't ideal to be drinking with the Wellbutrin, but I still had 1 beer every week or two without much problem.  \n\nI also noticed on a long plane ride in January that I still had that enlarged lymph node behind my ear and maybe a second one near it. The larger one was about the size of a Jelly Belly and the smaller one about half that size.  Neither of them were (are) sore or anything.  They felt (feel) rubbery and don’t move when pushed.\n\nWhen my appointment with the Endocrinologist came in mid-March, the lymph nodes had roughly doubled in size to a Jelly Belly and Peanut M&amp;M (I have a sweet tooth and can't think of other size/shape references). The Endocrinologist confirms they are lymph nodes, but didn't seem concerned with them or my thyroid. He suggested getting my thyroid levels taken every year and that my fatigue might have been related to seasonal affective disorder.\n\nAfter being reassured by the endocrinologist I inwardly tell myself to suck it up and forget about the fatigue and be thankful for the weight loss and ability to eat whatever I wanted. As Spring came into full effect and my fatigue didn't go away with the change of season I started to figure I might have Mono or something.\n\nAbout a month ago I started to get really nauseated after only a sip of beer.  I figured that was the Wellbutrin.  But then I started having a constant feeling in my stomach similar to how I feel when I am slightly motion sick. It gets worse with some foods (fatty, acidic, and spicy foods).  Regardless of what I eat, if I eat a lot and my stomach is full, I get a pain in my upper left stomach area. I think maybe I have an ulcer? It has been limiting how much I eat and now I'm down to 125 lbs.\n\nThe lymph nodes haven’t gotten any bigger since March (Jelly Belly and Peanut M&amp;M).  The only other thing I can think of that might be related is that in the last 2 months I have been sweating like crazy once a week or so at night.  I think that has to do with the temperature change though.\n\nI am really sick of the fatigue and nausea cramping my style, but I have been reassured by 3 doctors.

First I'll start on the weight then explain quiting smoking. By the way I'm 5'11\". No before or after pics here, sorry. \n\n**Background**\n\nPretty much in high school I weighed around 185-190 until about senior year, combining that and the freshman 15 I weighed around 215 at the end of freshman year. For the first two years of college, I maintained a pretty good work out plan, despite my weight being stagnant at 215 during the entire time. I did not really diet, and I would say I ate neither healthy nor/unhealthy, just kinda whatever.\n\nThen I turned 21, over the next couple of years my weight fluxuated a lot, I gave up working out, probably got up to around 230. Then, when I was 23, I started just packing on pounds. It got to the point where I started actually feeling I weighed too much, and early in my 24th year two events happened that decided I had to change. \n\n1. I weighed myself one day and I broke the 260 barrier. For some reason that was the line, I broke down crying that day, I couldn't believe what I was seeing, and was disgusted with myself. \n\n2. After a check up and a blood test, it showed that I was border line pre-diabetic (but not yet), and was borderline high cholestoral. My doctor pretty much said while I'm ok now, if I keep this up we're gonna start seeing things go south. \n\n\n**Some False Starts**\n\nThe first few months after this I got a gym membership, and began working out, I stuck with the elipitcal machine because it was the only machine I felt comfortable that I could maintain a steady pace at. I worked myself up to doing an hour a day, although I hardly did any lifting, and I had several failed diet attempts. I had managed to get down to 241 (19 pounds lost) but after getting in the lower 240s I hardly saw any drop at all. \n\n**A month off**\n\nI had various family events that caused me to abandon my working out for about a month, during this time I stayed in the lower 240s until the very end when I went back to the upper 240s, around this time was when I got the blood test back and it literally scared me back into working out. \n\n**What did I do**\n\n**Exercise:** To me, this was a lot easier than dieting. I believe it is because you can see results easier than dieting, meaning you can lift more, run faster/longer etc etc. When I decided to get back, I preped with 2 weeks yoga and light cardio, before undergoing 90 days of p90x. I pushed myself as much as I could, but for much of the first few weeks there were exercises was I was pretty much skipping or only doing a 1/3 of. On days I felt I had a lot more energy I'd add cardio. After the 90 days, I sorta started over/went to the gym to lift more because I started feeling more comfortable at the gym. \n\n\n**Diet** This was the hardest for me. I didn't stick with a particular diet because everytime I tried I failed. Instead, I did a little custom method, and slowly took baby steps towards healthy eating. Instead of a 32 oz coke, I began getting 12 oz diet cans, after I felt comfortable with that, I began mixing coffee in, until I was pretty much off sodas. Burgers, I'd say no to fries, eventually I moved to chicken sandwiches. Desserts? Instead of a 300 calorie ice cream, I moved to popscicles, only 30 calories, this allowed me to have 2 or 3 somedays and still save a couple of hundred calories. \n\nThis is way I believe some people should do it. It's simply too hard for people to move from unhealthy eating to healthy eating overnight. Portion control barely worked for me, because I was drastically increasing the amount of calories I was burning (is what I believe). Every week, I tried to eliminate something unhealthy. I wish I wouldve done more, but my economic/other life situations made it nearly impossible to. \n\n\n**Smoking** This was by far the hardest, and I had prescription help. I was already on wellbutrin (an anti depressant which is also used as a drug to quit smoking), so my doctor switched my dosage from one 200 mg of the extended release a day, to two 150 mg instant release a day. \n\nDespite having this it was still nearly impossible. I read somewhere that the average craving lasts 3 minutes, so whenever I felt a craving I tried to do something that I knew would take a while and I wouldn't associate with smoking. \n\nThe hardest part is what you hear about quitting. Everyone tells you the first 4-5 days are the hardest and from there its easy. While the first 4-5 are definitely the hardest, its really the first couple of weeks to a month that are still pretty darn hard, and a lot of people don't see that coming.\n\n\n\nMoral of the story is today I weighed myself, and I was at 199, this time I cried again (in a good way). I'm gonna eat a super unhealthy meal tonight to celebrate. My goal is 185, which would put my BMI in the healthy category....so I still have a slight amount of work to do. \n\nAnyways I've rambled on for a bit, so I'll answer any questions.\n\n","domain":"self.loseit","num_comments":4,"likes":null,"clicked":false,"thumbnail":"default","saved":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rz8w","ups":14,"approved_by":null,"score":12,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, just thought I&amp;#39;d share my story with everyone, I know people say this all I time, but if I can do it, ANYONE can.

No before or after pics here, sorry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty much in high school I weighed around 185-190 until about senior year, combining that and the freshman 15 I weighed around 215 at the end of freshman year. For the first two years of college, I maintained a pretty good work out plan, despite my weight being stagnant at 215 during the entire time. I did not really diet, and I would say I ate neither healthy nor/unhealthy, just kinda whatever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I turned 21, over the next couple of years my weight fluxuated a lot, I gave up working out, probably got up to around 230. Then, when I was 23, I started just packing on pounds. It got to the point where I started actually feeling I weighed too much, and early in my 24th year two events happened that decided I had to change. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I weighed myself one day and I broke the 260 barrier. For some reason that was the line, I broke down crying that day, I couldn&amp;#39;t believe what I was seeing, and was disgusted with myself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a check up and a blood test, it showed that I was border line pre-diabetic (but not yet), and was borderline high cholestoral. My doctor pretty much said while I&amp;#39;m ok now, if I keep this up we&amp;#39;re gonna start seeing things go south. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some False Starts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first few months after this I got a gym membership, and began working out, I stuck with the elipitcal machine because it was the only machine I felt comfortable that I could maintain a steady pace at. I worked myself up to doing an hour a day, although I hardly did any lifting, and I had several failed diet attempts.

My fiancee and I just did a weekend trip to NYC and used one of the Chinatown buses, and I wanted to let r/cincinnati know how it was, and some tips on riding the Chinatown bus (note: we took Sky Horse because it was the cheapest, also my fiancee found that it has a good safety record.

If you board in Cincinnati the driver takes your ticket and gives you stub &amp; you can sit anywhere (**sit middle-front, away from the toilet**).

In the buses we were in the lower numbers were towards the front and away from the smelly toilet.\n\nPrice: it is now $50 if you travel Friday, Saturday or Sunday, $30 for all other days.\n\nTickets: I went through GoToBus.com and printed out our tickets. Worked fine.\n\nParking: There is no official parking for the bus. We parked in one of the large parking lots in the area (near the mall), took a cab to where the bus is and didn't get towed.

I am 22, 5'5, white, and moderately handsome. I don't have the *best* response rate. So we happily chatted, and when I asked for her number, she said she wanted to get to know me better first. Fast forward a week of Skype IMing, and messages over OKc, we finally exchanged numbers. Onto our first date.\n\nIt went amazingly, we went to an arcade, played games, got dinner, kissed. However, there were two glaring red flags. Recently out of a relationship ~3 weeks. To boot, she was still living with the ex currently. Not to worry though, she said! She was moving within the week and all would right itself! Well she was moving, into a three bedroom apartment, with her friend, and HER EX! This was not something she made clear. \n\nFast forward to date 3. We are chilling at my place, cuddling and things are getting hot and heavy. She lets out that she is abstinent right now, she wants to stay that way for a month. I really like her at this point, and although sex is VERY important to me, I can wait for the right person. I am going to add here though that she is quite the tease, every time we would get together after that, once we were together things would escalate until last night.... Date 5.\n\nI drive out to her place, through an hour of oppressive traffic on our beloved 405 freeway. I rolled a joint for the way there, and with the throbbing bassilines from my speakers, the romp was bearable. I park my car and walk happily to meet her in front of her place. We go grab dinner, and have great conversation, then go next door into the furniture store to look at stuff. I start pretending like we are furnishing our house, and she plays a long. We come to rest after laughs and laughs, upon a huge brown leather sofa. We sit there, talk, and exchange kisses for about 30 minutes, when we see an older couple coming through to look at the furniture. We are commenting on how adorable we thought they were when they pass by and tell us how cute we are together. After we drove to a lookout I know of, high over the valley, she told me the ex was working in the Studio, and invited me to come back to her place. We laid on her bed and things quickly escalated, eventually we were naked and we had sex twice.\n\nThis morning, she calls me and says that she was uncomfortable about us having sex last night. She said also she saw a few things she saw as dealbreakers. **ATTENTION: you will scold me for this if you read on** For one, I hadn't pulled out. She has some type of condition where she does not ovulate, and therefore can't have kids, so there was no condom use. However, she still expected me to know to pull out, like that is obvious. (Maybe it is to some, but not to me) She also said that I had come twice, and I didn't make sure she came between the first and second that I had. When I had my second, she was approaching climax, but I stopped short (had she said something I could have kept going, I am not overly sensitive and can keep on keeping on). So basically what I read from all this is: I feel bad about having sex with you, you should too, and I just *had* to call you to tell you about it. \n\nI don't know where to go from here Reddit. I really enjoy this girls personality, and have been enjoying the time we have been spending together. However, I shouldn't feel bad about having consensual sex, and it's kind of fucked up to call someone to criticize their performance after the first time you have sex. I was honestly really embarassed she didn't come. I am usually a very skilled lover. I think the whole situation just reeks of disaster. \n\n**TL;DR** Meet girl on OKC. Had sex, calls following morning to tell regret. *~Fade to past~* Going on dates, going on dates, red flag or three, going on dates. Sexy night arrives, followup morning call from girl, \"Hey, you should feel bad because I said I wanted to be abstinent for a month, and btw, you sucked b/c I didn't cum\".

I really enjoy this girls personality, and have been enjoying the time we have been spending together. However, I shouldn&amp;#39;t feel bad about having consensual sex, and it&amp;#39;s kind of fucked up to call someone to criticize their performance after the first time you have sex. I was honestly really embarassed she didn&amp;#39;t come. I am usually a very skilled lover. I think the whole situation just reeks of disaster. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; Meet girl on OKC. Had sex, calls following morning to tell regret. &lt;em&gt;~Fade to past~&lt;/em&gt; Going on dates, going on dates, red flag or three, going on dates. Sexy night arrives, followup morning call from girl, &amp;quot;Hey, you should feel bad because I said I wanted to be abstinent for a month, and btw, you sucked b/c I didn&amp;#39;t cum&amp;quot;. Don&amp;#39;t know how to handle situation, and be diplomatic. WHAT DO I SAY TO THIS GIRL?! Do I call her, wait for her to call me? Should I feel bad here?

I had asked him to do it before and he always refused so it was kind of weird. However, he did enjoy breaking into song and dance every Saturday morning while making breakfast.

I tried so hard to never tell anyone about it, but he was pretty involved - came to games and other events - and I got over it. My school kept trying to use him to host fundraisers, but he always refused. There was this time where he took a bunch of my friends and I snowboarding, which turned into a cluster in the parking lot.. part of the reason being not only is he Carlton, but he also was wearing a purple ski suit.\n |All I've ever gotten out of him was that she was psychotic and on an array of things.\n[Add a helmet and he would've been the first official PURPLE POWER RANGER FTW!

I started spotting people trying to come over to say something to him and I gave them the coldest death eye I could muster and most of the time it worked. When I got older I started being more vocal about it, but I think it might have started to annoy him because people were to scared to interrupt us.\n[How does Alfonso feel about Carlton?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0r8l/ama_alfonso_ribeiro_carlton_is_my_stepfather/c4ik4mq?context=5)|It's a love/hate relationship. He still thrives on being recognized and still tries to make a career out of it, but he hates that he is still type-casted. He went through a phase where he really hated being Carlton.. right about the time that Family Guy made fun of him and Urban Outfitters came out with the neon t-shirt. I had to walk by that shirt in the window of Urban for several months my junior year of college. \n[Did you ever get to meet any cool people through him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0r8l/ama_alfonso_ribeiro_carlton_is_my_stepfather/c4ikb2t?context=5)|Depends on your definition of cool.

Alfonso has gotten rid of all memorabilia that connects him to that movie and tries to forget it was ever a part of his career.

I'll try to make this \n\nquick. I'm 21 years old. I did go to college after\n\nhigh school because that's what my parents wanted. I quit after a \n\nyear and half because I wanted to focus on\n\nmy needs and my desires and what I wanted out of life. Backtracking \n\na lil bit to the first days of college. To pay\n\nthe bills off, I got a job at a place called Opportunity Village. My job \n\nrequired me to drive to parents' homes and\n\ntake care of their disabled child. I was with Opp Vill for two years (I \n\ncall the family I worked with my family\n\nnow.) before moving away to try and make my dream become a \n\nreality. And that is to build a charity casino.\n\nWhere I am living now, I was unemployed for 6 months before finding \n\na job a month ago. I couldn't do any of my\n\nideas I had planned because I had no source of income and I lived off \n\nmy brother for half a year, bringing up my\n\ndebt outstandingly. But since I got my first paycheck, I have been \n\ntaking baby steps towards my goal and that\n\nwould be selling cookies to the town to try and raise some sort of \n\ncapital to build upon. That got me thinking\n\nsince I needed to raise money where are some places to go to place \n\ndonation boxes around town? A Church. A\n\nchurch is full of nice people always wanting to do good deeds and \n\nhelp out others. So I drove around town\n\nlooking for churches. After a couple hours of driving around, I figured \n\nI'll put 5 donation boxes in 5 different\n\nchurches. \"Yeah, I could get at least a few hundred dollars out of the \n\nmonth\", as I thought to myself. Boy was I\n\never wrong.\n\nThe next day on the Sunday morning, as I walked into the church, \n\nthe majority of the people were in the lobby\n\ntalking, gossiping, catching up, waiting for mass to start. I was happy \n\nbecause I was thinking \"This is such a\n\ngreat idea.\" As excited as I was, I asked a kind lady where the pastor \n\nwas, to seek his permission to put a\n\ndonation box in the church. The kind lady went away for a while and \n\ncame back with the pastor. We did our\n\nmeet and greets and then we got to business. I stated my case. I \n\ntold him. I have a dream of building a charity\n\ncasino that will give 100% of its profits to organizations, charities, \n\nand businesses to find/fund: Cures for\n\ndiseases, renewable resources, building shelters for the homeless, \n\nclear the pollution/ clean the environment,\n\nhelp low income families, and so on. Giving me a puzzled look as if \n\nsaying with his facial expression \"Wow! This\n\nisn't what I was expecting.\" He then got his sense back and said \" \n\nWell Josh, I don't like it. You would be\n\nexploiting people.\" \"What do you mean?\" I ask. He says \" If you built \n\nthis charity casino people would come to\n\nyour casino and spend there hard earned money at your casino and \n\npossibly walk out with nothing. So I say\n\n\"You don't think people are doing that anyway?\" \"People are gonna \n\ngamble until the end of time.\" \"No there not\"\n\nas he cuts in. I give him one of my own puzzled looks as if to say \n\n\"Seriously? You think so?\" I tell him what I\n\nthink about casinos right now in this day and age and tell him \"There \n\nare casinos right now that are doing just\n\nthat, there taking peoples hard earned money and keeping it for \n\nthemselves.\" \"Do we see any of that money\n\nused towards a just cause? No.\" \"So why don't we use that money \n\nand try to bring some good out of the\n\nsituation.\" He then gets off topic, the pastor asks me if I had a \n\nchurch. I say \"No\". He tells me, \"I think it would\n\nbe best if you found God first, he can help you in many different \n\nways. Disappointed, I summon up the words to\n\nsay \" I'll think about it.\" Minutes turn to ten minutes ten to twenty of \n\nhim talking about God. The pastor\n\npreaches to me that Jesus was either a liar, a lunatic, or a lord. Still \n\ndisappointed and non interested I say\n\nnothing. He talks on about changes and how god can only make those \n\nchanges in people. All the while, I'm in my\n\nown mind thinking \" And you still preach this mans teachings if you \n\nthink he was a liar, a lunatic, or a lord?\" (I\n\nwas baffled that a priest would even say that.) I finally caught what \n\nhe was saying at the end of his preaching,\n\nhe went as said \"Only God can make a change in your life.\" I say \n\nnothing to do the fact that if I did say\n\nsomething the battle of religion and thirty more minutes of preaching \n\nwould continue and I still had 4 churches\n\nto go too. Realizing we have been talking for quite some time the \n\npriest looks at his watch and says \"Oh mass is\n\nabout to start\" \"Hey Josh, can I pray for you? As I lift up my donation \n\nbox that's made out of a milk jug, I say \"\n\nOnly if you let me put this in your church\" \"No, I can'y let you put \n\nthat in here.\" he quickly replies. \"Well then no\n\nyou can't pray for me.\" I say. He says, \"Oh I'll pray for you anyway\" \n\n\"No, seriously don't pray for me.\" And I turn\n\nmy head and walked out of the church, having my entire perspective \n\nchanged... I can't associate with any type\n\nof religion. I do believe we have a creator but I'm not going to pay \n\nattention to that because when I die, I\n\nbelieve all my answers will be answered. My attention is focused on \n\nthe people in this world. There is to many\n\ndiseases, wars, destruction, hunger, poverty, crime, and corruption in \n\nmy book. And if my casino will help in even\n\nthe smallest of percents, if there is a chance to cure cancer and \n\nmany other diseases/disabilities then I'll\n\ncontinue to press onward. I don't want help from religion, only want \n\nhelp from the people in this world. If I seen\n\nthe priest again I would like to ask him \" So you believe in a higher \n\npower do ya? God has a plan for everyone\n\nright? Well this may have been his plan to heal the world and you, a \n\npriest of all people, spat in his face. How\n\ndoes that make you feel?. I would probably get a response like \"No \n\none knows Gods plan\" or You may be right,\n\nyou may be wrong but I'll still believe in God, the Holy Spirit and in \n\nthis here, Holy Bible. That reminds me, I told\n\nthe priest I think to many hands have been on the bible. Its been \n\naltered with to many times for my liking .\n\nMy journey towards the casino continues. I'm selling cookies to the \n\nneighbors. I got a profit of $100 so far.\n\nThat's good for a first couple of baby steps. And I'll still be selling \n\nuntil the end of the summer and possibly even\n\nlonger. I decided a couple months ago, that I NEED to go back to \n\nschool for a business degree just so that\n\npeople will take me more seriously.\n\nI believe working at Opp Vill has changed my life for the better. I can \n\nalready see differences from when I was in\n\nhigh school. I care about making a positive change in this world and \n\nI'll carry that out throughout life.\n\nTo see one of the kids I worked with click on the link down below. \n\nCaution!

I&amp;#39;ll try to make this &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;quick. I&amp;#39;m 21 years old. I did go to college after&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;high school because that&amp;#39;s what my parents wanted. I quit after a &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;year and half because I wanted to focus on&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;my needs and my desires and what I wanted out of life. Backtracking &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;a lil bit to the first days of college. To pay&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the bills off, I got a job at a place called Opportunity Village. My job &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;required me to drive to parents&amp;#39; homes and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;take care of their disabled child. I was with Opp Vill for two years (I &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;call the family I worked with my family&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;now.) before moving away to try and make my dream become a &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;reality. And that is to build a charity casino.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where I am living now, I was unemployed for 6 months before finding &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;a job a month ago. I couldn&amp;#39;t do any of my&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ideas I had planned because I had no source of income and I lived off &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;my brother for half a year, bringing up my&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;debt outstandingly. But since I got my first paycheck, I have been &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;taking baby steps towards my goal and that&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;would be selling cookies to the town to try and raise some sort of &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;capital to build upon. That got me thinking&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;since I needed to raise money where are some places to go to place &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;donation boxes around town? A Church. A&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;church is full of nice people always wanting to do good deeds and &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;help out others. So I drove around town&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;looking for churches. After a couple hours of driving around, I figured &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll put 5 donation boxes in 5 different&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;churches. &amp;quot;Yeah, I could get at least a few hundred dollars out of the &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;month&amp;quot;, as I thought to myself. Boy was I&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ever wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day on the Sunday morning, as I walked into the church, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the majority of the people were in the lobby&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;talking, gossiping, catching up, waiting for mass to start. I was happy &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;because I was thinking &amp;quot;This is such a&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;great idea.&amp;quot; As excited as I was, I asked a kind lady where the pastor &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;was, to seek his permission to put a&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;donation box in the church. The kind lady went away for a while and &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;came back with the pastor. We did our&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;meet and greets and then we got to business. I stated my case. I &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;told him. I have a dream of building a charity&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;casino that will give 100% of its profits to organizations, charities, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and businesses to find/fund: Cures for&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;diseases, renewable resources, building shelters for the homeless, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;clear the pollution/ clean the environment,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;help low income families, and so on. Giving me a puzzled look as if &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;saying with his facial expression &amp;quot;Wow! This&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;isn&amp;#39;t what I was expecting.&amp;quot; He then got his sense back and said &amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well Josh, I don&amp;#39;t like it. You would be&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;exploiting people.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What do you mean?&amp;quot; I ask. He says &amp;quot; If you built &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;this charity casino people would come to&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;your casino and spend there hard earned money at your casino and &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;possibly walk out with nothing. So I say&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t think people are doing that anyway?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;People are gonna &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;gamble until the end of time.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;No there not&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;as he cuts in.

I've been doing the New Blood program from Convict Conditioning since late October and I've seen some significant gains compared to the nothing that I had before. I'm not sure if I'm going too slow, but I'll type out what I've got so far:\n\n* Pullups: Step 3 (skipped step 2 after trying for many months and getting almost nowhere after a while)\n* Pushups: Step 3, nearly step 4\n* Squats: Step 6\n* Leg Raises: Step 3, almost step 4\n\nI read that I should be able to go up a step each month, but that doesn't seem to be working out. I'm fine with going slowly if I have to, but I'd like to know if I can go any faster.\n\nCurrently my diet is somewhat minimal. I'm 22/m, 5'8\" and have stayed at 135 lbs for several years. I have a lot of flab, but my muscles have gotten noticeably bigger/harder since I started training. I don't know why I don't weigh more, but I see at least a smallish difference in my muscle.\n\nI've been doing research and used Wolfram Alpha to calculate my BMR at 1606 Cal/day. I'm mostly sedentary, so I guess that adjusts it to 1927 Cal/day. So I'm guessing that in order to gain muscle, I have to eat at around 2200 calories per day, right? If I were lifting weights 3 times per week I'd do more. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nI'm pretty concerned with gaining fat if I were to do this. I've heard of bulking/cutting where people gain a lot of muscle and also a lot of fat at the same time, and then they cut calories to lose all that fat. I don't want to go through that. I'll sacrifice speed if it means not getting fat and having to cut. I'm all about the journey, which is partially why I chose to do CC.\n\nAnother concern is about different nutrients. How do I know how much protein, fat, carbs, etc. to eat? I've heard a lot of conflicting ideas, especially about protein. Some people say I need one gram per pound of bodyweight, while others say I only need around 55 grams of protein per day. The latter is apparently according to scientific research. I don't know about the former at all.\n\nI have a kitchen scale and I don't see it as too much of an inconvenience to measure and record everything that I eat, but I don't even know what to eat. I like nuts, fruit, vegetables, tofu, edamame, beans, quinoa, brown rice, and milk/dairy (I'm a vegetarian, no eggs or fish). And because I never actually know what or how much to eat, I end up getting junk food once or twice a day because I just think \"ah, fuck it.\"\n\nHonestly, I'd just like some advice and a push in the right direction. Sorry for typing out so much, but even after a lot of research I've become really confused. I know I have the right foods in mind and some of the right ideas to start with, but I want to solidify it in my mind and start to really eat with a purpose (other than to live, haha).\n\nMy current goal is to get to the later steps of CC and to gain muscle. I know that's ambiguous, but I don't know how much I should weigh or how much body fat percentage I should have (or how to measure that). I'm hoping I can talk through it with a few of you to help me through my goals. Maybe I want to weigh 145 lbs of mostly muscle.

I want to be good at this stuff, I really do, but I also have major self motivation issues (part of why I failed). I&amp;#39;ve been considering not going back to school. I really don&amp;#39;t want to go to school and continue to fail with how expensive it is. I feel like my peers have always had way more knowledge than me and while most my friends graduate, I still have 3 or so years to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should I just suck it up and finish the degree? Is it possible to make a good amount of money without a degree (that 60k average CS graduate pay I hear about sounds nice)? I don&amp;#39;t really want to be an academic or a computer systems programmer, I just want to develop software that is going to help people, to make their lives easier. How can i get GOOD at programming without school? What do you think I should do? I thought that the semester I failed this past fall was extremely stressful, but being out of school has turned out to be just as bad because I spend every single day thinking about how the fuck the rest of my life is going to turn out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1335900974,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

(My last job sent me the 401k check after I quit, and I used it to pay of credit cards. It was only like $700 anyways.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband and I file our taxes jointly, does his income count towards mine for the purposes of getting an IRA? Or do I have to wait until I have a legitimate job?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1335899782,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

I can't really describe it, it wasn't even depression (I didn't feel sad or anything) I just felt so... apathetic. I didn't really think there was any reason to continue living because I'm going to end up dying anyway. I ended up just thinking \"fuck it\" the night before I returned to school, and I ate like a handful of pills (I forget what they're called, they're those round red ones with the sweet coating,) went to bed, wrote a note and fell asleep, expecting to never wake up. Obviously I didn't really do my research and didn't take enough because I woke up at like 5 am feeling weak and threw up... I remember thinking that my room smelled like a hospital or something because even though they weren't that strong I took a LOT of pills. Anyway I hid my note and called my sister in to tell my mom I was sick...

I don't really think it's depression or anything because it only happens sometimes but whatever. I think part of why I'm sad even when I'm out of the house is because while I'm angry at them I still feel bad for my parents... since they're both assholes they don't really have any friends and I always think of them being alone in that empty disgusting house with no one to talk to. My sister, who is 3 years older than me left the house when she was 16 and is on bad terms with them.
