I am excited about the opportunity and for my background/experience it is a great opportunity career wise. However, the major difference between my previous responsibilities and now would be a good deal of travel (~35% / 7-8 overnights a month). I don&amp;#39;t travel at all now and this would be a pretty radical change in my daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My questions are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;a) Does travel usually garner a premium on salary? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;b) should i ask for more money?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;c) For people in the industry, how does this usually work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your thoughts...... &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1320182536,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

You can live off taxpayer dollars the more babies you have and the poorer you are.  That's more.. MORAL HAZARD.  That creates an incentive to continue the cycle.

I saw him again this past weekend (we had been pretty busy) and he spent the night at my house again after a show.  This time, the cuddling/touching was pretty intense, but we still didn't kiss or anything.  I decided to just tell him that I'm into him.  We have a decent conversation about hooking up before we pass out.  My memory is kind of fuzzy on the details unfortunately, but in short he made it seem like he's into me (told me he likes me, thinks I'm attractive) but that he's in a weird place and he's trying not to start anything with anyone.  He just moved here the day before I met him and started grad school, and I know he's busy.  He made it seem like he's trying to force himself to be boring and serious about school, but he said that he doesn't really feel into it anyway and he's not sure how long his weird boringness will last (I asked him and he even said, \"I have no idea.  tomorrow, maybe?  ten seconds from now?\").  We pass out, cuddle all night, and the next afternoon when we wake up, we spend five hours laying in bed, talking, cuddling.

It was shocking because even though she was 79 she had really no serious health problems. She was visiting my mothers house for a few weeks so it was good that I got to spend some time with her before she left but I'm feeling very guilty. I told her Sunday that I was going to see her and I never did, I figured I had all week and I was planning on seeing her today. \n                                                                                                           \nI'm also upset because I'm 24 and I've never been married or had children. She always talked about how beautiful my children would be and wanted me to have one so badly. I always wanted my grandma there to see me get married one day and have children... she's the only grandma I've ever known. My other grandma and grandpa died before I was born. For some reason this bothers me the most and I can't stop thinking about it. Like as a granddaughter I never did my granddaughter duty which to her was make a family and give her great grandchildren. \n\nMy mother got home from work and found my grandma face down in the tub. She died while she was going to the bathroom... they think it was a heart attack. I guess her face was so badly bruised and deformed from the way she smashed her face and she threw up apparently, so they wouldn't let us see her. I'm just afraid that she suffered... she was always afraid to die. It breaks my heart thinking about her scared and alone while she was dying. \n\nI just wanted to talk about it right now... I'm missing her so much. I wish I saw her yesterday or Sunday and gave her a hug goodbye. Can someone relate to this feeling guilty because they never had children or married because it's something that was important to some loved one? How did you get over it?  \n\nEdit: Honestly people if you don't like someones post about their dead grandmother that is fine, but are you really that heartless to downvote something like this? I don't see the point at all... leave it alone if it's something you don't want to read. I've been on Reddit for a year now and people are so different on here then they used to be.

It was shocking because even though she was 79 she had really no serious health problems. She was visiting my mothers house for a few weeks so it was good that I got to spend some time with her before she left but I&amp;#39;m feeling very guilty. I told her Sunday that I was going to see her and I never did, I figured I had all week and I was planning on seeing her today. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also upset because I&amp;#39;m 24 and I&amp;#39;ve never been married or had children. She always talked about how beautiful my children would be and wanted me to have one so badly. I always wanted my grandma there to see me get married one day and have children... she&amp;#39;s the only grandma I&amp;#39;ve ever known. My other grandma and grandpa died before I was born. For some reason this bothers me the most and I can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about it. Like as a granddaughter I never did my granddaughter duty which to her was make a family and give her great grandchildren. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother got home from work and found my grandma face down in the tub. She died while she was going to the bathroom... they think it was a heart attack. I guess her face was so badly bruised and deformed from the way she smashed her face and she threw up apparently, so they wouldn&amp;#39;t let us see her. I&amp;#39;m just afraid that she suffered... she was always afraid to die. It breaks my heart thinking about her scared and alone while she was dying. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to talk about it right now... I&amp;#39;m missing her so much. I wish I saw her yesterday or Sunday and gave her a hug goodbye. Can someone relate to this feeling guilty because they never had children or married because it&amp;#39;s something that was important to some loved one? How did you get over it?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Honestly people if you don&amp;#39;t like someones post about their dead grandmother that is fine, but are you really that heartless to downvote something like this? I don&amp;#39;t see the point at all... leave it alone if it&amp;#39;s something you don&amp;#39;t want to read. I&amp;#39;ve been on Reddit for a year now and people are so different on here then they used to be. I don&amp;#39;t really care about downvotes or upvotes, but I do find it sad that people can be so fucking rude. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1320157662,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}
