I've been lifting at home since the beginning of the school year doing SL 5 x 5 for 4 months (made little gains because no cardio and bad diet) then GSLP for 2 months. I have a few questions and somet things I need advice on. First off, I want to create a nice base so when puberty kicks in, I will be a monster. I just want to look good I don't care about my lifts. My ideal physique is Frank Zane (thegodhimself) but I know that would take many years of training proper diet etc. But I am up for it. When I first started lifting I got sucked into oh be strong then you will look good and did sl. But looking at most peoples progress photos, people who do 6 day splits or spits in general end up looking ALOT better then those doing ss and sl since they aren't focusing on strength. What lifting routine should I be doing if I just want to look good? I work out at home so I only have a leg extension/curl machine, pull up bar, barbell, bench, dumbells and lat pulldown but can not do bench press. My dumbell lifts are low compared to my barbell lifts which are always low. For the past two months I have been eating at near maintence/above which is 2500 cal and 150g or protein while biking for fun and cardio 3 times a week.  What should I be eating to create a nice base so when I hit puberty I look like a god and make huge gains. I do realize it will take lots of time and dedication and I am willing to put forth the effort and wait. Also I feel I have only been making gains on my legs and arms, nowhere else. I think I either have a pulled nerve or tendonitis in my left arm and am wondering what ways should I approach this. Rest and ice or strengthening the tendons since my forearms are pretty weak.  The reason I am not bulking at like 500cal+ is because I am self conscious of my stomach. Is my bodyfat to high to see my abs or is it my abs are weak and not visible, so I should focus on them more? And for a side note, my friend is currently same age as me and not lifting at all. All he plays is tennis and in the last 6 months he has made the same amount if not MORE gains then me from puberty which often leaves me discouraged. How can I not be discouraged when my friend who eats junk food, and doesn't lift looks better then me because of him hitting puberty before me while I get left in the dust?

Since then, I&amp;#39;ve dropped from 195 to 172 lbs. I haven&amp;#39;t been noticing any progress on either my body aesthetics or my lift numbers for about 2 moths now. I think it might be time for me to do a cut or a bulk but I am unsure of which one to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My current bench max is 235, squat is 265 and dead lift is 245. I do chest and triceps on Monday and Wednesday which consists of bench press, incline press, dips, dumbbell press, tricep pull downs and skull crushers. On Tuesday and Thursday I do back, biceps, forearms, and abs which consists of dead lift, barbell rows, pull ups, chin ups, lat pull downs, bicep curls, shoulder raises, hammer curls, military press followed by an ab workout. Sundays I do squats, leg press, hamstring curls and calf raises. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I eat about 2100 calories a day and watch what I eat very closely. Most of my meals consist of egg whites, oatmeal, steak, chicken, salmon, broccoli, spinach, canned tuna, brown rice, oranges, pears, grapes, protein powder and sweet potatoes. I measured my body fat last week with calipers and I am around %17. I take 4 orange triad a day, 1 scoop of ON whey after my workouts with 5 grams of creatine and flax seed oil at night. \nI was wondering if you guys could please suggest a new direction in terms of cutting or bulking for me to take?

I think it might be time for me to do a cut or a bulk but I am unsure of which one to do.\n\n My current bench max is 235, squat is 265 and dead lift is 245. I do chest and triceps on Monday and Wednesday which consists of bench press, incline press, dips, dumbbell press, tricep pull downs and skull crushers. On Tuesday and Thursday I do back, biceps, forearms, and abs which consists of dead lift, barbell rows, pull ups, chin ups, lat pull downs, bicep curls, shoulder raises, hammer curls, military press followed by an ab workout. Sundays I do squats, leg press, hamstring curls and calf raises. \n\nI eat about 2100 calories a day and watch what I eat very closely. Most of my meals consist of egg whites, oatmeal, steak, chicken, salmon, broccoli, spinach, canned tuna, brown rice, oranges, pears, grapes, protein powder and sweet potatoes. I measured my body fat last week with calipers and I am around %17. I take 4 orange triad a day, 1 scoop of ON whey after my workouts with 5 grams of creatine and flax seed oil at night. \nI was wondering if you guys could please suggest a new direction in terms of cutting or bulking for me to take? I want to see new gains whether its higher lifting numbers or a  better looking body. The only thing I am hesitating about is that I used to be really fat and am worried about gaining a lot of fat when bulking. Also any advice on my lifestyle and workouts would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. \n\nHere is a picture i took of myself this morning for reference-http://imgur.com/1P7Qj0F","secure_media_embed":{},"score":1,"subreddit":"Fitness","author_flair_css_class":null}

I also have a terrible reputation among my friendship group.

I&amp;#39;ve been lifting at home since the beginning of the school year doing SL 5 x 5 for 4 months (made little gains because no cardio and bad diet) then GSLP for 2 months. I have a few questions and somet things I need advice on. First off, I want to create a nice base so when puberty kicks in, I will be a monster. I just want to look good I don&amp;#39;t care about my lifts. My ideal physique is Frank Zane (thegodhimself) but I know that would take many years of training proper diet etc. But I am up for it. When I first started lifting I got sucked into oh be strong then you will look good and did sl. But looking at most peoples progress photos, people who do 6 day splits or spits in general end up looking ALOT better then those doing ss and sl since they aren&amp;#39;t focusing on strength. What lifting routine should I be doing if I just want to look good? I work out at home so I only have a leg extension/curl machine, pull up bar, barbell, bench, dumbells and lat pulldown but can not do bench press. My dumbell lifts are low compared to my barbell lifts which are always low. For the past two months I have been eating at near maintence/above which is 2500 cal and 150g or protein while biking for fun and cardio 3 times a week.  What should I be eating to create a nice base so when I hit puberty I look like a god and make huge gains. I do realize it will take lots of time and dedication and I am willing to put forth the effort and wait. Also I feel I have only been making gains on my legs and arms, nowhere else. I think I either have a pulled nerve or tendonitis in my left arm and am wondering what ways should I approach this. Rest and ice or strengthening the tendons since my forearms are pretty weak.  The reason I am not bulking at like 500cal+ is because I am self conscious of my stomach. Is my bodyfat to high to see my abs or is it my abs are weak and not visible, so I should focus on them more? And for a side note, my friend is currently same age as me and not lifting at all. All he plays is tennis and in the last 6 months he has made the same amount if not MORE gains then me from puberty which often leaves me discouraged. How can I not be discouraged when my friend who eats junk food, and doesn&amp;#39;t lift looks better then me because of him hitting puberty before me while I get left in the dust? Thanks in advance to ANYONE who put up reading this massive wall. \nEdit: Also, there is a pic showing my collar bones/clavicles and how they are just straight across. Is this bad or good, I feel so skinny and boney, and those things just are straight across while others people look very different.

I have a few questions and somet things I need advice on. First off, I want to create a nice base so when puberty kicks in, I will be a monster. I just want to look good I don't care about my lifts. My ideal physique is Frank Zane (thegodhimself) but I know that would take many years of training proper diet etc. But I am up for it. When I first started lifting I got sucked into oh be strong then you will look good and did sl. But looking at most peoples progress photos, people who do 6 day splits or spits in general end up looking ALOT better then those doing ss and sl since they aren't focusing on strength. What lifting routine should I be doing if I just want to look good? I work out at home so I only have a leg extension/curl machine, pull up bar, barbell, bench, dumbells and lat pulldown but can not do bench press. My dumbell lifts are low compared to my barbell lifts which are always low. For the past two months I have been eating at near maintence/above which is 2500 cal and 150g or protein while biking for fun and cardio 3 times a week.  What should I be eating to create a nice base so when I hit puberty I look like a god and make huge gains. I do realize it will take lots of time and dedication and I am willing to put forth the effort and wait. Also I feel I have only been making gains on my legs and arms, nowhere else. I think I either have a pulled nerve or tendonitis in my left arm and am wondering what ways should I approach this. Rest and ice or strengthening the tendons since my forearms are pretty weak.  The reason I am not bulking at like 500cal+ is because I am self conscious of my stomach. Is my bodyfat to high to see my abs or is it my abs are weak and not visible, so I should focus on them more? And for a side note, my friend is currently same age as me and not lifting at all. All he plays is tennis and in the last 6 months he has made the same amount if not MORE gains then me from puberty which often leaves me discouraged. How can I not be discouraged when my friend who eats junk food, and doesn't lift looks better then me because of him hitting puberty before me while I get left in the dust? Thanks in advance to ANYONE who put up reading this massive wall. \nEdit: Also, there is a pic showing my collar bones/clavicles and how they are just straight across. Is this bad or good, I feel so skinny and boney, and those things just are straight across while others people look very different. Lots of people say it makes it look like i have big traps when I am wearing a tshirt when I don't have traps at all. \n\n\n **TL;DR Tell me what routine to do to become aesthetically pleasing when puberty kicks in, time is not an issue, nutritional paths (bulk, leangains, maintence, etc) and what I should focus on.**\nhttp://imgur.com/a/zAOBh","link_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2ql8s","permalink":"/r/bodybuilding/comments/1bgzky/want_to_create_a_nice_base_looking_for_advice/","over_18":false,"author":"Fforfreedom","num_comments":10,"media_embed":{},"gilded":0,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/1bgzky/want_to_create_a_nice_base_looking_for_advice/","created_utc":1364858794,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"bodybuilding","secure_media_embed":{},"score":0}

We dated for 2 years, she was the first girl that I ever kissed and had sex, and this only made me think more that I HAVE to do anything to change my life, I cannot rely on another opportunity like this to have a girl, I need to change. That's why I came to seddit to find help, to change myself.  \nI've been on CBT for over a year focusing on social skills, which helped me ALOT with normal interactions through the day, but not with women.  \n\n**I'm a medical school freshman** and a week after I broke up I went to my first party, and decided that on **that day I would make the first approach of my life**. Well, we went to a quieter place in the house, I used good body language, even though I had never read about kino I automatically did that, got to the level 3 but I was too afraid to try to kiss her at that moment and get denied because everybody would see it. Then I brought a brought up a bad topic (her ex and mine), I gotta admit that was one of the stupidest move i've ever made. *Even after she cried to me and told me we were just friends* I felt SO GOOD, because after all those years being a nerdy guy and losing all my self-steem I finally did something and fought against my AA.  \n  \n  \nTime foward to yesterday. There was this girl in my class that every guy is hitting on. Actually she is very very friendly to them all, like playing with every one of them, laughing and letting them touch and hug her (I guess you all know the kind of girl I'm talking about). From what I learned I'm trying to treat her differently than any guy, just giving some negs sometimes.\n\nBut the thing is, none of them have asked her on a date yet, and yesterday I was the first one to do it. So here is the transcript of the conversation:  \n**Her**:\"Hey new_alpha, are you going home now? (*I go home with my 2 female friends, one of them is the driver, and she usually comes with us*)  \n**me**: \"Yeah, we are, but if you don't want to come with us I have noooo problem at all (laughes)\"  \n**her**: \"Oooh, so you don't want my company??? Don't you enjoy my company (laughes also)\"   \n**me**:\"Haha, I never said that\"  \n  \nThen I turned on to talk to another girl that was passing by and finally all the group of friends that were busy decided to leave and go to the car. On the way to the car I called her and asked:  \n**me**: \"Hey mari, are you going to do anything this saturday?\"  \n**her**: \"Humm, this sat? Yeah I am\"  \n**me**: \"Then what about this friday?\"  \n**her**: \"Well, nothing\"  \n**me**: \"Then lets go watch some stand-up comedy on the theater (she's very different from any other girl, she doesnt like clubs and doesn't drink)  \n**her**:\" Yeah! Lets go then! Just see and tell me which one\"  \n\nWe talked a little and I made some jokes to make her laugh on the way home, but nothing about her (I think i failed on this, since I could have brought up her personal interest with these jokes).  \n\nWhat do you guys think.

One point in my life, 16 I think, I ended up losing 45 lbs without much effort. I just stopped eating ice cream every day, and I ended up weighing 160. Same height as I am now.\n\n\n\nI kept the weight off until I moved out of my dad's house (now I realize why he never bought the \"good cereal\" with whole milk or pizza all the time. That stuff packs on pounds.) I ate out all the time, and within 9 months, I have gained 40 lbs back on. My hips have been hurting and it's hard for me to find clothes I can fit into. \n\n\nNow my diet, please don't judge me, consisted of pizza almost every day, Burger king, Carls JR, Mcdonolds. Every day. Well I lost most of my money on food. I pigged out, and I sure payed for it. \n\n\n\nSince I weighed myself for the first time since I moved out, I have changed my life, and my wallet around. Since I am 19, I thought \"Hey, it shouldn't be too hard to lose weight.\" Well, it is. \n\n\n\nI don't have a car. I walk EVERYWHERE. I longboard for about an hour a day, and it gets my heart rate up. I drink probably 6 to 8 cups of water a day. I haven't had soda for a month. I eat salads with little to no dressing, I don't eat fries, I haven't had icecream in awhile. I have been working my ASS off to lose weight, and the 4 lbs i did lose came off the first week I started my diet (I think it had something to do with bloating because... you know why.) I eat from 1200 calories to 1500 calories a day. Sometimes less, if I am really busy and I just forget to eat. I am hungry a lot. Also, I have switched my birth control pills about 6 months ago.\n\n\n\nSo this close to what I eat every day:\n\n\nMorning: \n\n\nServing size of peanuts (240)\n\n\n\nWater\n\n\n\nCup of black coffee (5)\n\n\n\n\nAfternoon is where I eat most of my calories:\n\n\n\nSalad with grilled chicken and honey mustard dressing with some chicken (400 calories)\n\n\nGreek yogurt (140 calories)\n\n\nCheese stick (50 calories)\n\n\n\nDinner:\n\n\nONE Piece of pizza (400) (I know, one piece is really hard.)\n\n\n\nMashed sweet potatoes (about 150)\n\n\n\n\nThat is just a very generic overview of COMMON foods I do eat for those times. I only have ONE piece of pizza maybe once every 2 weeks.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can do? I am getting frustrated. I was always told the majority of the weight comes off in the very beginning.

My hips have been hurting and it&amp;#39;s hard for me to find clothes I can fit into. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now my diet, please don&amp;#39;t judge me, consisted of pizza almost every day, Burger king, Carls JR, Mcdonolds. Every day. Well I lost most of my money on food. I pigged out, and I sure payed for it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I weighed myself for the first time since I moved out, I have changed my life, and my wallet around. Since I am 19, I thought &amp;quot;Hey, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be too hard to lose weight.&amp;quot; Well, it is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have a car. I walk EVERYWHERE. I longboard for about an hour a day, and it gets my heart rate up. I drink probably 6 to 8 cups of water a day. I haven&amp;#39;t had soda for a month. I eat salads with little to no dressing, I don&amp;#39;t eat fries, I haven&amp;#39;t had icecream in awhile. I have been working my ASS off to lose weight, and the 4 lbs i did lose came off the first week I started my diet (I think it had something to do with bloating because... you know why.) I eat from 1200 calories to 1500 calories a day. Sometimes less, if I am really busy and I just forget to eat. I am hungry a lot. Also, I have switched my birth control pills about 6 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this close to what I eat every day:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morning: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Serving size of peanuts (240)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Water&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cup of black coffee (5)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Afternoon is where I eat most of my calories:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Salad with grilled chicken and honey mustard dressing with some chicken (400 calories)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Greek yogurt (140 calories)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheese stick (50 calories)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dinner:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ONE Piece of pizza (400) (I know, one piece is really hard.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mashed sweet potatoes (about 150)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is just a very generic overview of COMMON foods I do eat for those times. I only have ONE piece of pizza maybe once every 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there anything else I can do? I am getting frustrated. I was always told the majority of the weight comes off in the very beginning. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","link_flair_text":null,"report_reasons":null,"id":"1bgo04","distinguished":null,"media":null,"title":"4 Lbs in 1 month.

Anyway, this isn&amp;#39;t about social pressure to have sex, or anything. I&amp;#39;ll just say it simple. I&amp;#39;m horny and I&amp;#39;m lonely. Between the internet and being in college surrounded by plenty of opportunities to go to parties and pick up some random girl, I feel like I could get laid anytime I want to considering I may be shy but I&amp;#39;m not socially crippled and I&amp;#39;m not horribly ugly. The thing is I sort of have this notion that I should be in love and that the experience, at very least for the first time should mean something. Perhaps this is just a vestige of my christian upbringing which I have now rejected, but I feel like just having a one night stand or messy FWB relationship would leave me with emotional baggage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this is somewhat weird in the modern western male to actually care about the sentimental value of such things, but I can&amp;#39;t help but think it should matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand I am desperately lonely, and sexually frustrated and feel like a loser, and I can&amp;#39;t stay like this forever.

Anyway, this isn't about social pressure to have sex, or anything. I'll just say it simple. I'm horny and I'm lonely. Between the internet and being in college surrounded by plenty of opportunities to go to parties and pick up some random girl, I feel like I could get laid anytime I want to considering I may be shy but I'm not socially crippled and I'm not horribly ugly. The thing is I sort of have this notion that I should be in love and that the experience, at very least for the first time should mean something. Perhaps this is just a vestige of my christian upbringing which I have now rejected, but I feel like just having a one night stand or messy FWB relationship would leave me with emotional baggage.\n\nI know this is somewhat weird in the modern western male to actually care about the sentimental value of such things, but I can't help but think it should matter.\n\nOn the other hand I am desperately lonely, and sexually frustrated and feel like a loser, and I can't stay like this forever.

My birthday was a few months ago, and I&amp;#39;m 20 now, and he is 26. We are no longer together. The last few months have been painful, but I&amp;#39;ve been managing to &amp;quot;cope.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We broke up first week of December, and we have not had any contact since then. What happened was one of his friends (who I talked to once or twice) ended up finding out the guy was yanking on my strings. My ex bf used to talk behind my back to this particular friend of his (let&amp;#39;s call him Jake), saying I was crazy, clingy, wouldn&amp;#39;t leave him alone, etc. Jake ended up mentioning the comments my ex-bf had made in passing to a friend that knew both my ex and I (let&amp;#39;s call him Dan). Dan found the inconsistencies weird, especially considering my ex-bf had said good things about me to him. He ended up contacting me, asking me if there was anything wrong in our relationship, and what was up. I was completely shocked to find out the nasty things my ex-bf was saying behind my back to his friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, everything kind of blew over within a week, and with Jake contacting me (I&amp;#39;d never talked to this guy besides hi-bye at social events with my ex-bf) offering me support, etc. Eventually I decided to try to give my ex one final benefit of the doubt, and would try to talk to him calmly about why he was doing what he was doing, and hopefully get some straight and honest answers. I showed up at his place one day, and as soon as I mentioned a word of what I&amp;#39;d heard he&amp;#39;d been saying behind my back, he lashed out at me, accused me of trying to &amp;quot;bait&amp;quot; him into admitting something that wasn&amp;#39;t true, said I was a bitch and an immature child, didn&amp;#39;t want to be with me anymore, and he kicked me out. Didn&amp;#39;t even take five minutes for me to notice he&amp;#39;d blocked me everywhere (Facebook, Twitter, and hell, even Steam, which I rarely even touch).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was a mess that day, and didn&amp;#39;t understand how he could discard me that easily. I ended up staying at my best friend&amp;#39;s house for the weekend, and I can honestly say it was the worst weekend of my life. I tried, foolishly, to call him one final time and try to get some sort of &amp;quot;closure&amp;quot;, but he picked up my first call, told me to fuck off, and hung up on me. I tried to call two more times, but he cancelled them immediately and sent them to voicemail. I haven&amp;#39;t heard from him since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jake and Dan both felt really bad, and my ex ended up trying to keep being friendly with both of them, but they both decided to stop being friends with him, having seen how big of a prick he really was. I felt bad at first, like it was my fault they lost his friendship, but they both assured me it was their own choice, and they couldn&amp;#39;t look at the guy the same way anymore. I&amp;#39;m now friends with the two of them, and they&amp;#39;ve been supportive these past few months, and we&amp;#39;ve gotten much closer. They are both really good guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a few friends who also cut off contact with me, and I hear this is because he would tell anyone who bothered to listen that I was his crazy ex-girlfriend who couldn&amp;#39;t let go, I caused him to lose friends, and that I was talking behind his back, amongst other things to slander me. There was one friend I lost that I was very upset over losing, because I thought she was a fairly good friend of mine, but she turned around on me for his favour. She didn&amp;#39;t even give me a chance to explain my end of things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first few weeks were really rough. I had to deal with my mother calling me stupid for having let myself get manipulated, and then deal with my failing grades at school. I was doing fairly well last semester when we got back together, but since December, I stopped going to my classes and just stopped doing any work. The school year is over in less than two weeks. I am positive I have failed all but one of my classes (which I&amp;#39;m only passing because I showed up to the midterm and did semi decent on it). I will most likely be on academic probation following this year. It&amp;#39;s unfortunate because I missed the deadline to drop the classes, so now I have to take a fail on my record.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My job is doing okay. None of my coworkers know much about what&amp;#39;s going on, but my supervisor has been understanding (she doesn&amp;#39;t know the full story, just that it&amp;#39;s something that affected me pretty badly). I&amp;#39;ve managed to keep my work ethic going to the point it&amp;#39;s not dramatically effecting my performance, and this has helped me to keep my job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve become less and less &amp;quot;incompetent&amp;quot; over the weeks, and I&amp;#39;m starting to find my life is kind of going back to &amp;quot;normal.&amp;quot; I have days I feel numb, and days I feel like the end of the world is amongst me. I try to keep my head up and remind myself things WILL get better, but deep in my heart, I&amp;#39;m not really believing it. I wish I could feel better on the inside, and not carry such a heavy day-to-day burden. I thought time would heal me and I would go back to &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; once I &amp;quot;got over&amp;quot; my ex with time, and while I&amp;#39;m starting to build my life again without him in it, I still feel... empty? I feel like I&amp;#39;m going through the daily motions more than &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot; anything for the days. I&amp;#39;ve stopped having anxiety attacks, due to my lack of triggers (since my ex and I broke up, my life has become &amp;quot;mundane&amp;quot; so to speak), so I stopped using benzos for taking care of them. The doctor who was watching over my drug use has considered this an &amp;quot;improvement&amp;quot;, but in a weird way, I kind of miss having anxiety attacks. Sometimes I&amp;#39;ll find myself trying to trigger myself into one, because I feel more &amp;quot;alive&amp;quot; having one than I do being so... numb. If anyone has any experience with this feeling, any input would be appreciated lol. I&amp;#39;ve tried picking up previous hobbies I was into (painting was one of them), but being so emotionless, I don&amp;#39;t feel any &amp;quot;motivation&amp;quot; and it all gets boring quick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, I guess I&amp;#39;m doing &amp;quot;better&amp;quot;? I haven&amp;#39;t had any contact with my ex, and although I would never take him back, and I&amp;#39;m lucky in a way that he never chased after me trying to get me back (and he never will - he started dating a new girl a week after breaking up with me, and I think since then, he&amp;#39;s gone through 2 or 3 more girls). If I get really down on myself, I start beating myself up for having being stupid and having &amp;quot;wasted&amp;quot; my love on him. It gets hard to get up and move on once I start beating on myself, and I find it very hard to be kind to myself, so most of the time I wait out &amp;quot;episodes&amp;quot; until I feel better and/or exhaust things to beat myself up with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find it very hard to believe I will ever love again, and if I do, I fear I&amp;#39;m still &amp;quot;vulnerable&amp;quot; to being guilted and used like this guy used me. I wonder how long I have to wait and work on myself until I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;ready&amp;quot; to really have a healthy relationship. I&amp;#39;d also like to point out I&amp;#39;m terrified i&amp;#39;m the type of girl who&amp;#39;s just attracted to assholes and emotionally unavailable men, and I don&amp;#39;t know if I could truly ever bond with a healthy man. I seem to be naturally unattracted to them When I was 17 and in High School, I dated a guy who really loved me, yet I found his love overly repulsive, and I just wonder what it is about me that made me so unattracted to him. When we broke up, I was labeled the &amp;quot;bitch&amp;quot;, and the next guy I fell head over heels for was my ex-boyfriend a year later, who turned out to be an asshole, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, sorry for the bit of long post, just wanted to hear some more feedback and something to maybe get me seeing forward and not live this life so dulled as I currently am. Honestly, in a sick twisted way, I miss being a bag of emotions, and I much rather prefer it than this dullness and emptiness I feel now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Ended up breaking up with boyfriend in December. Haven&amp;#39;t had contact since, and ended up becoming friends with two of the people who helped initiate the breakup.

Started fapping at the age of 13 (approximately), viewing pictures that I would download (I had a dial up connection). This was the case at least up to my 18th year of life, when I had sex for the first time and I would also be introduced to faster internet connections and video porn. Throughout my fapping history I have always been interested in one specific theme: FOOT FETISH. I put it in capitals, since it has been one of the main issues for my addiction. I was since I can remember interested in feet, stockings, pantyhosed feet, socks etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of relationships, I have been into two serious ones (I am this kinda guy): one for 4.5 years (sex started after two years in the relationship), followed by a bit more than a year of no sex after my breakup and then another relationship for 3 years, which I am currently at. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During both my relationships, I have been masturbating. Not so much at the beginning, but later, when the flare had somehow gone. Similarly to what I said before, almost all the porn I’ve been watching was foot fetish related. I am almost certain that the reason is that I have never fulfilled my fetish i.e. have some foot fetish play. Even though I could have tried it with my girlfriends, I always considered it something that I would want to do with some girl that I didn’t love. For instance, I would always fantasize about giving foot massages to other female friends or girls from school or uni. Was thinking of an escort at some point but didn’t get down to doing that. So since that never happened, I always had to fap to foot fetish videos in order to fulfil my needs for female feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did I understand about my porn addiction?&lt;/strong&gt; Even though, I have been masturbating for more than a decade, things became more serious during the last year and a half. The reason is that I have spent it away from my girlfriend for postgraduate studies – the distance is two different countries, so I would have sex every 4 or 5 months all this time. The rest of the time would be masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since mid-February I have been back to my hometown, where my girlfriend is too and we basically spend all our nights together in my apartment, even though we have separate apartments. However, we haven’t had sex for almost a month and a half. I am mostly to blame since it seems that I have lost my sex passion. I would look at porn and girls’ feet even when my girlfriend was at home with me simply by turning my laptop screen away from her sight. And obviously I could not wait for her to leave home, so that I could enjoy my favourite pornstars and internet sensations playing with their feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, it goes without saying that this all has been caused by porn.\nAnd now? I am currently at day 4 of my campaign and apart from the first day that I browsed a few sexy photos from facebook friends, I haven’t looked at porn at all. Even though I had been quite knowledgeable of the porn field, knowing many pornstars and having many favourites, I cannot claim that I miss it - so far so good. \nHowever, I have started having thoughts of other girls that I know and like, and of the limited sex experience that I’ve had in terms of sex partners (2 in relationships and 1 as a one night stand). I have to claim that I never thought of cheating before and I would hate to do it. But I am tempted to have sex with others more than I ever was. Today, I was watching a women’s volleyball match on TV and all I could see was boobs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, I love my girlfriend and I am doing it for her mainly, but of course for myself too. However, I do not know if I will be able to wait until I get my libido back and start having sex again with her or I will try and hook up with others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few questions that I have now:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Would you look at porn at all after rebooting? I mean, it’s not porn that is bad itself; it’s too much porn that destroys you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are those feelings that I have, namely that I want to hook up with every girl I see, normal? Will I have these kinds of cravings for all the duration of my nofappathon?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Do you have any advice to give me with regards to what I believe is a special case like mine?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope everything works fine… :) It&amp;#39;s great to have you all here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","thumbnail":"self","mod_reports":[],"report_reasons":null,"link_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.NoFap","user_reports":[],"stickied":false,"edited":false,"retrieved_on":1412922059,"author_flair_text":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1bgah3/special_case_foot_fetish_porn_addict/","created_utc":1364848421,"banned_by":null,"author":"georgefootsie","over_18":false,"num_comments":5,"gilded":0,"media_embed":{},"subreddit_id":"t5_2skrn","permalink":"/r/NoFap/comments/1bgah3/special_case_foot_fetish_porn_addict/","selftext":"Hello fellow fapstronauts,\n\nLet me start with a bit of a **background**: I am 26 years old.

First you ground yourself by imagining roots extending from the base of your spine or your heels, depending on if you&amp;#39;re sitting or standing. Then you imagine a beam of golden white light shining and expanding throughout your body from the top of your head. Forcing out all of your negative energy and leaving only the good. But my problem is that when ever I imagine the beam of golden white light, I think of this: &lt;a href=\"http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/4/2011/09/space_laser2.jpg\"&gt;http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/4/2011/09/space_laser2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;.
