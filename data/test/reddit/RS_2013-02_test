My husband is awesome, my 2 year old is the bee's knees and the 2 month old is sweetie bell incarnate.  But it's not helping anything that (with the infant) we're not getting much sleep.\n\n\nWe moved far away from our families when we first got married so that my husband could get his graduate degree and we moved directly between them (1.5 hours to either family) 5 years later after having our son.  Now that we've seen what it's like to be 1.5 hours from family, we want more. \n\n\nI get super sick (hospitalized multiple times) when pregnant and if we want to even mildly consider a third child, we need a support system nearby.  An hour and a half away is not close enough for a dinner get together or regular babysitting. It's definitely not close enough for my children to know (at least one set of) their grandparents well.  And the house we're currently living in is less than ideal for us in the long run, but it's okay for now.  \n\n\nWe found THE PERFECT HOUSE for us right near his family (grandparents/greatgrandparents/cousins/aunts/uncles all in the same city! Crazy!)- it wouldn't increase his commute by time (though his mileage would double), and I love his family.  They're supportive and welcoming and respectful and helpful and loving. They want to be involved.  Also, MY family hasn't visited us more while we live 1.5 hours away than when we lived 7 hours away.  They just don't see us very often and don't make the effort to.  We are always the ones to initiate calling them, skyping with them, or visiting them and they ALWAYS make it seem like a burden for them - that they have better things to be doing.\n\n\nWhen we announced our intent to move to my family, we were met with nothing but criticism and derision.  My mom waited till she could speak solely to me to tell me that she thinks I'm selfishly making this decision by myself, forcing my husband into a longer commute (thereby endangering his life), for no good reason!  She also threw in there that she thinks I say absolutely horrible mean things to him that she would never dream of saying to my father.  I asked her what she meant, that I didn't understand - could she explain? and she responded with, \"Well, if you weren't paying attention, then it obviously doesn't matter to you what I said.\"\n\n\nI spent days wracked with guilt - I'm ALWAYS the one to cave first and try to initiate peace with her but I wanted not to do that this time.  And then we had to put our 20 year old cat to sleep.   I was sobbing, holding the cat to say goodbye, and my sweet husband suggests that I call my mom when he left for the Vet's office, because she would understand my anguish (having just put my childhood dog to sleep several months ago) no matter what else was going on.  So I did:\n\n\nMe: *sobbing* We're putting Ella to sleep tonight.\n\nHer: *Sigh* Why can't you sleep tonight?\n\nMe: No. We're putting Ella to sleep tonight.\n\nHer: ... You don't even care what my opinion is...\n\nMe: What are you smoking? We are putting our CAT to SLEEP tonight.\n\nHer: Oh... Ugh. Look. You have known for a long time that she was going to need to be euthanized. \n\nMe: SERIOUSLY? WOMAN WHO CALLED ME SOBBING ABOUT HER 15 YEAR OLD DOG?\n\nand I hung up...\n\n\nIf it wasn't clear - She totally expected me to call sobbing, begging for her forgiveness/understanding.  It's gross.  We've healed things to a point, thanks to my husband helping me not to be a total bitch through email - but I have a hard time being the kind and mature one in this relationship with my mother and I've decided not to be the one to reach out to her now, it's her turn to say \"I want to skype!\" at the very least.  It's been a week since I've heard from her. \n\n\nOn top of all of that, we put our house on the market.  It has now been on the market for 1.5 weeks.  We've had 11 showings with three more scheduled tomorrow and an open house on Sunday.  I don't know if that sounds like a lot - but it's a fucking nightmare keeping the house immaculate with a 2 year old and a 2 month old (And I'm not supposed to take the 2 month old out into public settings according to the doctor because **FLU**).    Then I get to sit here awkwardly while inviting people to judge my home, desperately trying to make sure I'm not wearing spit up and my toddler isn't screaming. \n\n\nYesterday we found out that our dream house - that seriously had everything we wanted and was squarely in our budget - has officially been sold.  The realtor didn't even call to tell us they got an offer. \n\n\nI was supposed to have something to look forward to this weekend in the form of a visit from my best friend from college - but we've had to reschedule because of the sheer number of showings combined with the fact that she's sick. \n\n\nOn Sunday, when we get out of the house to make way for the Open House, we're going to go visit the ONE possible alternate property that's near my husband's family.   There's only one because our needs are so damn specific it gives me a freaking headache.  It makes me sick to my stomach because if we stay perfectly in our budget (Which we fully intend to do) we are EXTREMELY limited. But if we could just look in a range $50,000 higher it would open up about 30 more [great] options. \n\n\nI'm exhausted. Stressed. Overwhelmed.  I'm angry at my mother - both that she can't seem to support us in this decision and that she can't fucking come out and say \"I don't want you to move because I love you and I'll miss you being close!\".  I miss my cat.  I'm starting to actively HATE people who come to view the house - especially the people who came today and stayed for all of 8 minutes.  Turds. Also I never want my house to be this clean again, EVER.  It's soul-killing.  AND now I have such heart-breakingly high hopes for this house we're going to see on Sunday that it will (guaranteed) either NOT work for us, or suddenly get sold before we have a chance to make an offer (which we're waiting to do till we have a solid offer on our house!). \n\n\nI don't have any local friends (we've only been living here for 1.5 years and I'm pretty much a shut-in with the kids) and any long distance friends have already heard bits and pieces of this saga from me as it happened and also aren't in the same life-space...

This has made me &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; apprehensive of starting anything with a girl that is not a complete random encounter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bit of background: I&amp;#39;m 30 and just got out of a 3 year relationship, the last few months of which were completely sexless (I remained faithful while trying to salvage the relationship). Since the breakup, my logistics are terrible. I&amp;#39;m still in the process of moving out of the place I shared with my ex and the only other apartment I have access to has roommates. To top it off I&amp;#39;ve been on the nofap diet for about 2 months now. So let&amp;#39;s just say I&amp;#39;m horny as fuck these days, to put it mildly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coming to the point of this post, I have a number of attractive females that I interact with on a regular basis that I have number-closed (or feel confident I can easily number close). However I get the nagging feeling they are all &amp;quot;too close to home&amp;quot; in some sense, and that a fuck-up with any of them would not be without consequences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The breakdown at the moment looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;HB6 I met at a party. Turns out she lives across the street. Number closed. She sends texts joking about trying to figure out where my apartment is from her window.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;HB7, waitress at food joint #1, is super friendly. She recently suggested getting drinks or jamming together. I agreed but didn&amp;#39;t number-close. I eat at this place at least 4 times a week and not being able to eat there would seriously impact my quality of life.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;HB7.5 is a new waitress at food joint #2: I usually go there twice a week. We chatted yesterday for a few minutes, big smiles and all, and in a moment of weakness, the image of her hot little curves in my bed flashed before my eyes and I number closed her on the spot.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;HB5 (smoking body but the face doesn&amp;#39;t do it for me) and HB8: Two employees at my local ski resort. Pretty sure I could number close either. The mountain is my retreat though, and I want to keep it that way.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;HB8 is another waitress at food joint #3 (What&amp;#39;s with me and waitresses :). Again I eat there 2 to 3 times a week. She smiles even when she&amp;#39;s not serving me, she&amp;#39;s only in the city for a few months. I&amp;#39;m pretty confident I can number-close if I want to. Not being able to eat there would be an inconvenience but not a catastrophe.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;HB7 is an employee at my bank. Again, smiles, questions about my weekend plans, touches her hair while talking etc. It would be pretty bad if I mess up the relationship with my bank.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;HB8.5 lives in the same condo complex. Saw her a couple of times at the gym. She showed a lot of enthusiasm when we talked. She asked if she can go snowboarding with me. We went for drinks where I escalated to some hand holding, hugs, walked with arm around her back but no k-close. She seems like gf material but I&amp;#39;m really not ready to jump into a relationship right now. This is the most difficult one. All alarms are going off in my head because she can really shit on my parade. Just a couple of days ago I had decided that I should keep her as a friend and cancelled the plans we had for tonight. But damn is it hard to think about letting her go and not get a pang of pain. I&amp;#39;m resisting texting her to make plans for Sunday even as I&amp;#39;m typing this...&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There are also these 2 female friends that started showing some odd interest since learning that I was single. Had this really awkward one-on-one with one of them where it took all the self-control in the world not to put my hands and mouth all over her. I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind a FWB thing with either one of them but I feel that if I push for it and they refuse or want more, it would pretty much be the end of the friendship.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;#39;d like to get some expert opinion on whether I&amp;#39;m being way too cautious. I still have regrets about similar past opportunities that I didn&amp;#39;t pursue because of the same concerns. The girls would end up switching jobs after a few months, moving out of the city, etc. I and would end up thinking I should have gone for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now I feel like I&amp;#39;ve been starved for a few weeks and someone is putting a juicy but poisoned piece of steak in my mouth. It&amp;#39;s hard not to just say &amp;quot;fuck it&amp;quot; and bite!

Would you try to leverage any of these into a FWB? If so how would you go about it? I did read the pretty detailed guide on FWB tactics that got posted to seddit a few days back but I think it talked about the &amp;#39;how&amp;#39; but didn&amp;#39;t really touch on evaluating the trade-offs of a situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course I have thought of trying different venues for pick-ups. I&amp;#39;m not terrified of street approaches but I still don&amp;#39;t do it consistently, even when there are clear IOI&amp;#39;s from the girl passing by. I have an easier time number-closing in slightly less &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; settings (supermarket, mall, subway, etc.), and many of these girls turn out to live 1 or 2 blocks away from my place anyway. I&amp;#39;m actually always concerned when doing a street approach that I&amp;#39;ll run into a girl I approached in the past few weeks.

I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m going to do and I am so alone. I fear the landlord or someone chasing a payment will show up any day and I don&amp;#39;t even have an excuse. I&amp;#39;m mentally preparing myself for being on the streets, and it&amp;#39;s so cold. Images have started running through my mind of how I can survive this, but I honestly don&amp;#39;t think I have the strength to harm anyone or even at this point myself, I&amp;#39;m just not that hard of a person. I&amp;#39;m just sitting here alone. Scared. I decided to post here obviously to get off my chest and let it all out, but I would also really appreciate ANY advice of anything (legal) I could do. I hope you are having a better day than me. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","num_comments":3,"mod_reports":[]}

The years printed on the tang are &amp;quot;paris 1855&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;London 1851&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Stockholm 1866&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m not quite sure about this, but these seem to be dates when the company won prizes at fairs. But there is this one year, 1867, that doesn&amp;#39;t have any city printed with it. By that and the fact that it&amp;#39;s the latest year printed on the razor, I assume this is the manufacturing year. Please do correct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a few quick finishing words. I&amp;#39;d sincerely like to thank Wicked Edge and it&amp;#39;s users for all the direct and indirect help I&amp;#39;ve recieved from you.  Oddly enough, even though I&amp;#39;ve been a redditor for some time, I found this subreddit after I began shaving with a straigh, well, a shavette-type straight (baby wheels ;) ).

I moved in with my stepdad and mom after high school, and with my stepdad being both an ex marine and a current police officer, things have always been strict. Anyways, last week I finally made weight and got cleared to join the military, I was ready to be sent to MEPS. Then, I receive a call from my recruiter saying MEPS would not give me a physical because of my past eye injury, because I was stabbed in the eye with a pencil. Despite having perfect 20/20 vision now, I can&amp;#39;t join because my past eye exams were done months after my surgery, so they depict me as having bad vision, which was well over 10 years ago. On top of this, over the past month, I&amp;#39;ve begun to realize the military is no longer what I want. In fact, I&amp;#39;ve began to dread it. I&amp;#39;ve never handled verbal abuse, yelling, cursing directly at me well at all. I&amp;#39;ve grown up to both my step-parents calling me a pussy/baby etc., and I&amp;#39;ve yet to get used to it. I am just not a confrontational, cocky or aggressive person. Anyways, because I was planning on joining the Navy, I was not aloud to get a job or save up for a vehicle. So I have to pay my friends gas money if I want to go out with them on top of the cost that night. Continueing on topic, last night I took a girl I&amp;#39;ve dreamed about since high school on a date finally, and it was one of the most amazing nights of my life, just getting to hold her, to laugh with her. My stepdad&amp;#39;s brother let me borrow one of his trucks for the night so I could see her. Long story short, I hit a deer later on in the night 2 minutes from my house...before I continue, I&amp;#39;d like to explain that both my stepdad and his brother are very loaded. Both families live in double story houses with acres of land. My stepdad drives a corvette, my mom drives a Cadillac STS, and they have a Volvo SUV for a family vehicles to cart the kids around in. Warren(my stepdad&amp;#39;s brother), has an in-ground pool, 2 restored trans-ams, a Lincoln, a jacked up GMC, a Malibu, big house also, 4 four-wheelers, a RV, and a jacked up Tacoma that he calls a &amp;quot;toy&amp;quot;, which is what he let me drive last night. Anyways, they both tag teamed me today as I expected. I was called the usual, I was told how I should find another place to live, how I&amp;#39;m useless. I find it funny how I was never given a chance to try college. Anyways, I am making a plea to reddit. I am looking to start a career that I WANT, not them. I have no vehicle OR money. Is there a business owner out there that could provide cheap housing and a job that I have a chance to grow in? I am very physically able, I run up to 6 miles a day. I&amp;#39;ve also always enjoyed writing if that matters at all. I can learn and I am dedicated if I want something. I have nowhere to go. I&amp;#39;m 19, and I live in Georgia. I honestly don&amp;#39;t know what to do at the moment, the only plan I had is gone, and I wasn&amp;#39;t aloud to try any other career or college.

I moved in with my stepdad and mom after high school, and with my stepdad being both an ex marine and a current police officer, things have always been strict. Anyways, last week I finally made weight and got cleared to join the military, I was ready to be sent to MEPS. Then, I receive a call from my recruiter saying MEPS would not give me a physical because of my past eye injury, because I was stabbed in the eye with a pencil. Despite having perfect 20/20 vision now, I can't join because my past eye exams were done months after my surgery, so they depict me as having bad vision, which was well over 10 years ago. On top of this, over the past month, I've begun to realize the military is no longer what I want. In fact, I've began to dread it. I've never handled verbal abuse, yelling, cursing directly at me well at all. I've grown up to both my step-parents calling me a pussy/baby etc., and I've yet to get used to it. I am just not a confrontational, cocky or aggressive person. Anyways, because I was planning on joining the Navy, I was not aloud to get a job or save up for a vehicle. So I have to pay my friends gas money if I want to go out with them on top of the cost that night. Continueing on topic, last night I took a girl I've dreamed about since high school on a date finally, and it was one of the most amazing nights of my life, just getting to hold her, to laugh with her.

You can see my weight-loss trend here: http://imgur.com/Vyy4xSE\n\n\nI make sure to eat 1200 calories a day, I shoot for a 35% Carb/30% Fat/35% Protein diet. I try hard to keep my carbs at about 100g per day and to get at least 100g of protein every day. My fat varies from day to day between 30-60g. I take a multivitamin and B-vitamin supplement every morning and I drink at least 100oz of water every day, likely more. Breakfast is between 6 and 9am, My lunch is typically eaten throughout the day from 10am-4pm spacing my foods out as I feel hungry and then finally dinner around 6 or 7pm. \n\nYou can see a sample of my daily food here: http://imgur.com/Zl68rDj \n\n\nIn addition to my daily diet I've been going to the gym 4 days a week participating in zumba classes, abs class, walking on treadmill, stationary bike and then one day a week I go on a hike. Not all at once it varies from day to day so usually a 1 hour zumba class on Mondays and Wednesdays. \n\n\nI typically do not eat back the calories I've burned during the exercise because 1. I would like to see faster results, 2. I often do not feel the need to eat these calories back, and 3. I generally \"save\" up these calories for when I go out for dinner with family or friends once a week or for example this Sunday my family is getting together for Superbowl and while I plan to not go \"overboard\" I am not going to feel bad about eating a few [Atomic Buffalo Turds](http://www.theblackpeppercorn.com/2012/03/atomic-buffalo-turd-jalapeno-poppers-aka-a-b-t/)(though our recipie doesn't have the sausages.)\n\n\nI'm at a point where I don't have much of a choice but to lose weight.

While I CAN hike and I CAN preform these tasks I'm hindered and cannot preform them as well as I'd like. !alking into an interview at this weight I do not believe I will be hired because my physical appearance does not fit the person I am or want to be.

When I was born, my parents had owned two cats, Timothy and Elizabeth (my sister and I called them Timmy and Dizzy) for about 12 years. Dizzy passed away when I was about five years old. That was the first time I encountered death, and my parents had to explain to me what it meant. The family gathered around the lifeless feline, petting her for the last time. Once we had all said our goodbyes, my father took a shovel from the garage, and dug a hole in the side yard for the animal to rest in. My mother laid Dizzy down, and my father scooped dirt on top of the hole, while my sister and I searched the nearby woods for an adequate stick to serve as a grave marker. We all hugged, and carried on with our lives.\nA few years later, we adopted another cat, Azmire (named by one of my sister's friends). Azmire and Timothy rarely got along, and after a few years, Timothy's life ended. We gave him the same rites as we'd given his sister years back, burying him in an adjacent hole.\n\nThe next year, my mother was diagnosed, and subsequently succumbed to cancer. She never seemed sick to me, and it was as if she were here one minute, and gone the next. My mother was not a cat, so we couldn't bury her in the same fashion as we had with our animals. She was, however, the bread-winner of the household, and we could not afford full funeral services. We had her buried in the town's cemetery, in a modest coffin.\nNow we fast forward to present day; I'm 25 years old, and live with my girlfriend, Carol. This past weekend, the cat that I've owned for about 4 years, passed away. We rent an apartment, so we have no land in which to bury dead animals. However, my sister still lived in the house we lived in as kids, so I asked her if I could bury my cat next to our others. She agreed, and I brought my girlfriend and my ever-sleeping cat over to my childhood home. I grabbed one of my brother-in-law's shovels from the garage, and started digging a hole near the ones my father had dug a decade back. I must've dug too deep, because I hit something hard. Curious, I got on my knees, and dug out the dirt around the object with my hands. When I had uncovered enough of the thing, horror befell me, and I shuddered. \"What is it?\" my girlfriend asked. \"Not a cat,\" I responded, shaking. What lay in the hole in front of me was a human skull. \"Can you get me some water from inside?\" I didn't want her to get spooked, so I sent her inside while I covered the hole back up. \n\nWhen I had finished, I returned inside as well, and mentioned what I saw to my sister. She told me that she would visit our father sometime this week, to see if he knew anything about the human remains. Yesterday, I received a call from my sister telling me that my father became defensive when she asked him about the remains. This morning, the police called, and informed me that my step mother had found my father hanging from the kitchen ceiling in their house.

I graduated from Electronics and communications engineering. I live in an Asian country. I was one of the top students in my school scoring 94% when graduating high school (This includes math, physics, chemistry, biology). I also won international art competitions and was one of the best all round students in my school. I joined one of the top engineering colleges in my state. I did well in my first year. Then in my second year, I tried learning something else which was different from my academics and that brought my grades down. Could not get it back up and I was distracted by learning and running my side business. However, I still graduated and got a job in a top software company as a programmer. This is a fortune 500 firm and this job would have been the envy of many. However, I (like an idiot) turned the job down and started doing the business on my own and tried several times. It's been 4 fucking years and I could not make the business work. It was in a completely different field from my academics. Now, I have 4 years of experience which would not be considered valid since it is not from a job and therefore, has no proof for that experience. No savings, no work experience and no job. I feel like a fucking moron. I was one of those guys who had an amazing future way back right from school but instead have ruined myself now. All my friends have awesome careers and I am now feeling like a failure. Even people who just passed their exams with bad grades or who went to bad schools or those who were hopeless in terms of skills/talent/potential have done extremely well. This is in India and not the US. In the US, mistakes are forgiven and you can easily switch careers and start anytime you want. That is not the case in India. A gap in your resume or mistake is not forgiven. I have pretty much ruined my career and my life. Not sure where to go from here. I have been a huge disappointment to myself and my family. I am feeling depressed and suicidal. Will I ever be able to catch up and fix my life?

I graduated from Electronics and communications engineering. I live in an Asian country. I was one of the top students in my school scoring 94% when graduating high school (This includes math, physics, chemistry, biology). I also won international art competitions and was one of the best all round students in my school. I joined one of the top engineering colleges in my state. I did well in my first year. Then in my second year, I tried learning something else which was different from my academics and that brought my grades down. Could not get it back up and I was distracted by learning and running my side business. However, I still graduated and got a job in a top software company as a programmer. This is a fortune 500 firm and this job would have been the envy of many. However, I (like an idiot) turned the job down and started doing the business on my own and tried several times. It&amp;#39;s been 4 fucking years and I could not make the business work. It was in a completely different field from my academics. Now, I have 4 years of experience which would not be considered valid since it is not from a job and therefore, has no proof for that experience. No savings, no work experience and no job. I feel like a fucking moron. I was one of those guys who had an amazing future way back right from school but instead have ruined myself now. All my friends have awesome careers and I am now feeling like a failure. Even people who just passed their exams with bad grades or who went to bad schools or those who were hopeless in terms of skills/talent/potential have done extremely well. This is in India and not the US. In the US, mistakes are forgiven and you can easily switch careers and start anytime you want. That is not the case in India. A gap in your resume or mistake is not forgiven. I have pretty much ruined my career and my life. Not sure where to go from here. I have been a huge disappointment to myself and my family. I am feeling depressed and suicidal. Will I ever be able to catch up and fix my life? What Should I do from here? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Before anyone suggests moving to the US, The only way you can emigrate to the US from India is if you have family members there, or if you pursue higher studies there or get an employer to sponsor your visa.

I came to Reddit for the community of people. I have ended up moving to the other side of the planet where i have yet to make any quality friends and here's my dumb ass thinking Reddit would be a good place to start. lol i am definitely an idiot for that, ill give that one to you jerks.\n\nso here is who I am and what I stand for. I would never judge anyone on their own beliefs. I firmly believe in \"to each their own\", but since my beliefs make me the devil, I might as well lay them out there for everyone to see so they are not surprised next time they read something of mine.\n\n1. my husband is in the military. he is an fmf corpsman. which means he is \"green side\" navy so he works as a marine combat doc. \n\n2. to go with the above, I am immensely proud of my husband and his accomplishments. I am a big supporter of the military and anyone in it. That does not mean I wear his rank. I didn't earn that and I honestly could not do or go through what he has done and gone through. Being a proud supportive military wife, doesn't mean I act like his accomplishments are mine. It means I am proud of him and that is it. Now if i ever said \"Well my husband is such-n-such rank in this branch at this station so you need to respect me\" yes that would be considered wearing rank. but since I would NEVER dare say or even think that, then you have no room to call me a \"rank wearing wife\".\n\n3. I am not, nor will I ever be a fan of President Obama. Nothing, hear me NOTHING you say will ever change my mind. you can keep sending me nasty messages about how I am an idiot, and how I need to see the light and see things for what they really are. yada yada. No. You need to stop watching the news and come back to me when you have a well formed opinion based on FACT. then we can have a nice debate. We may end on the terms of agreeing to disagree AND THATS OK!\n\n4. gun control. (feel free to skip this, if it is not your opinion then move along, that is ok to do). if you seriously  think that taking guns away from law abiding citizens is going to keep them out of the hands of criminals, I strongly suggest you take about 30 seconds to really think that over with your own brain. not your media fed word vomit. your own brain. drugs are illegal, does that keep people from getting their hands on them? No it does not. Banning any type of gun is never going to work. Obama is slowing taking away our rights and you are letting him and you won't realize it is too late until you are already drawn too far into the trap to get yourselves out.\n\n5. Others views on America. Look I am sorry that you don't like America. If it isn't your cup of tea then that is fine. But for the love of god, that is my Country and my home and to sit there and make the assumption that I am a fat, lazy, stay at home wife, with 500 kids, living in squalor, smoking and getting drunk, cheating on my husband only because he is in the military, and withering away with the education of a 5th grader I'm sorry but you should check yourself. (seriously I have been told I am probably all of those things) I am well educated, I am married to a corpsman, we have been best friends since we were 14. We have no children because we married young and didn't/don't think we are ready to start a family yet. we are not stable enough because we move so much. my husband is my love and my life and I would never cheat on him, and I know full well that he is faithful to me. I do not smoke, I do not drink (I got drunk-ish once on my 22nd birthday) I'm 5'7 and weigh 145 lbs. so I am by no means fat. I love my curves. and believe me my husband does too. And honestly if you have never been to America then who the fuck do you think you are? he let me read a few news articles online and then that means i'll know everything about America. Idiots... America is a great place. I have traveled to or lived in most of the states. They are all beautiful and unique.\n\n6. I live in a foreign country with my husband on his military orders. we have a three year stint here. I do not live on a military base, i live out in town, 20 minutes from anything American and anyone who speaks English for that matter. Do not spend 3 DAYS telling me something I have taken a picture of or something I have learned is wrong. For the love of God, I live here! I think I fucking know what is going on around here. But no I still get the people who have never left there own city, or state, let alone their own country, telling me that one time their high school teacher told them otherwise. IDGAF. Like I said I live here so I'm pretty sure you don't know WTF you are talking about. (believe me this has happened at least ten times. All I wanted to do was post a pretty picture of the damn beach)...\n\n7. So if you have made it to here congrats. I apologize for any nasty language. I have had this on my shoulders for 2 months (since I joined  Reddit) and it feels so good to get it off. For those of you who I have offended, just remember that just because we think differently doesn't make either of us wrong. I am allowed to think and feel and say these things. So if you have nothing nice to say, just don't say anything at all. These are my opinions. I'm not asking you to agree with them. Or telling you yours are wrong. I am simply stating my own. But sending people hate mail EVERYDAY is wrong. so if you are one of those Redditors that like to make others peoples life's a living hell, please stop. Its both infuriating and saddening. I actually feel sorry for you.\n\nPhew! I feel about 100 times better now.

Obama is slowing taking away our rights and you are letting him and you won&amp;#39;t realize it is too late until you are already drawn too far into the trap to get yourselves out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others views on America. Look I am sorry that you don&amp;#39;t like America. If it isn&amp;#39;t your cup of tea then that is fine. But for the love of god, that is my Country and my home and to sit there and make the assumption that I am a fat, lazy, stay at home wife, with 500 kids, living in squalor, smoking and getting drunk, cheating on my husband only because he is in the military, and withering away with the education of a 5th grader I&amp;#39;m sorry but you should check yourself. (seriously I have been told I am probably all of those things) I am well educated, I am married to a corpsman, we have been best friends since we were 14. We have no children because we married young and didn&amp;#39;t/don&amp;#39;t think we are ready to start a family yet. we are not stable enough because we move so much. my husband is my love and my life and I would never cheat on him, and I know full well that he is faithful to me. I do not smoke, I do not drink (I got drunk-ish once on my 22nd birthday) I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;7 and weigh 145 lbs. so I am by no means fat. I love my curves. and believe me my husband does too. And honestly if you have never been to America then who the fuck do you think you are? he let me read a few news articles online and then that means i&amp;#39;ll know everything about America. Idiots... America is a great place. I have traveled to or lived in most of the states. They are all beautiful and unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in a foreign country with my husband on his military orders. we have a three year stint here. I do not live on a military base, i live out in town, 20 minutes from anything American and anyone who speaks English for that matter. Do not spend 3 DAYS telling me something I have taken a picture of or something I have learned is wrong. For the love of God, I live here! I think I fucking know what is going on around here. But no I still get the people who have never left there own city, or state, let alone their own country, telling me that one time their high school teacher told them otherwise. IDGAF. Like I said I live here so I&amp;#39;m pretty sure you don&amp;#39;t know WTF you are talking about. (believe me this has happened at least ten times. All I wanted to do was post a pretty picture of the damn beach)...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you have made it to here congrats. I apologize for any nasty language. I have had this on my shoulders for 2 months (since I joined  Reddit) and it feels so good to get it off. For those of you who I have offended, just remember that just because we think differently doesn&amp;#39;t make either of us wrong. I am allowed to think and feel and say these things. So if you have nothing nice to say, just don&amp;#39;t say anything at all. These are my opinions. I&amp;#39;m not asking you to agree with them. Or telling you yours are wrong. I am simply stating my own. But sending people hate mail EVERYDAY is wrong. so if you are one of those Redditors that like to make others peoples life&amp;#39;s a living hell, please stop. Its both infuriating and saddening. I actually feel sorry for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Phew! I feel about 100 times better now. Thank you very much for letting me let it all out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","domain":"self.rant","user_reports":[],"author":"Here_to_let_it_out"}

My name's Carolyn and I'm 23. So0p wanted me to go deeper into what I had written [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/FreshStart/comments/17ndlf/community_question_what_prompted_you_to_join/c875ix4), so this is it.\n\nI broke up with my boyfriend in June. He had told me before we began getting serious (about two and a half years) he also wanted to travel, to move out of our home town, but we just literally sat there and did nothing during our relationship. When I finally called it quits, my best friend who moved to Savannah needed some help, so help I did. I just moved here December 7th.\n\nI have only wanted to go back home ever since.\n\nFirst off, I was told that I didn't have to pay rent for December, as my job that I transferred had no jobs between the holidays and my partial unemployment was taking its time. Everyone already had hired for their season, so my friend said not to worry about it. But a week before leaving and saving up my money, I get a call saying I had to pay rent for December, thanks to her boyfriend (who does not live here) pitching a fit.\nNo big deal, I guess. Everything worked out in the end.\n\nI was suppose to go to school. Got everything ready, but then had to enroll in classes. First thing, I needed shots. No big deal. Went to the health department. The vaccinations I needed would have totaled out to be 220.00, which I couldn't get because the money I saved up for emergencies like that actually went towards December rent. :(\n\nAs for work, once work started back up again, I realized that I went from exceeding expectations to a complete joke. I have done this job ever since I turned 18, and I am very good at it, but coming here it's like I had to learn everything all over again. The supervisors don't treat me the way they should with the work load and make favoritism very obvious. I work a production based job in different places every day and they keep me from producing my goal numbers. I am late for one reason or another no matter if I was responsible or not. I would leave 45 minutes too early just to make sure I get there on time, but it doesn't matter. One job, I was given the wrong address for and was an hour and a half late, not knowing I was in the wrong city the entire time. Two days before, I was two and a half hours late because of a murder that was in our neighborhood. The police had blocked off the only exit and would not allow me to leave. My boss did not believe me. I ended up having to get a police report just so I wouldn't be reprimanded. Continuing with work, I didn't know I would be getting a $1.50/hour pay loss, as well as a drop in hours. My home district would put minimum staff on a job to ensure decent hours. Here, they put as many as possible to get the job done. I have worked every day this week, two doubles, and I've only cleared 22 hours. \n\nOur apartment is small. In fact, my friend and I are in a loft and are sharing a bed. That isn't bad. What's bad is I have no room to go to when her boyfriend (who again does not live here) brings his friends over late at night when I have to wake up at 3 or 4 in the morning to smoke and drink and be obnoxious. Not having that type of privacy is taking its toll. Also, our apartment is constantly getting worked on for the same thing. We constantly wake up to find our floor flooded with water because the same pipe keeps busting and the same company gets called to just do the same thing--not fix it. We have to constantly get our water bill adjusted, and we were told last week we can't do it again until next year.\n\nMy friend has a lot of friends. I only have her. But she doesn't seem to see that her friends only come over when they want to smoke a free bowl and then leave. I don't dig that sort of thing, so her friends sort of ignore me. Maybe if I was a prick about them smoking, I'd understand, but I swear I am not. I just turn down a shot, or pass the bowl to my friend when the bowl gets passed to me. \n\nThe dog. My friend and her boyfriend used to live together until he \"couldn't handle it anymore.\" I'm guessing \"it\" was the responsibility of growing up, because he doesn't want to pay the bills here, but he sure wants to eat our food, bring over his friends and so on. They got this beautiful dog together. She is about a year old now, and she is treated like crap. She's not abused, not really, or I'd figure out a way to get her away from here, but the training is not going well. I try to train her, but he comes over and smacks her when she does something she isn't suppose to do. He fusses at me saying that what he does works, but gets in a huff when I ask him why she still chews on toys or jumps on people and pulls the leash if his way works. He says that my way doesn't work. Of course properly training a dog isn't going to work if he's going to do something else. Ugh. Makes me mad just thinking about it. \n\nI was recently introduced to a guy. He's in the army, and has been waiting to deploy since June. I had told my boss (who introduced us) that I wasn't interested in military, but shit happened anyway. Of course, right when we start discussing making things serious, they have a date to deploy--next week. \n\nI also had changed my diet when I broke up with my former boyfriend. I was eating clean and eating right. I had gained about 40 or 50 pounds being with him because all we did was eat and sit as I would wait for *him*. Coming here is hard to eat like that. I'll be gone to work and come home with her and her boyfriend cooking my food in ways that I can't eat. Sometimes I will eat the fried food, but only sometimes. I buy food that I can eat, that's for me to cook. She buys junk food and packaged foods. When I spoke to them about it, it's like it's my fault. That I need to control what I eat. They don't seem to understand that I am trying to control what I eat, but they are keeping me from eating at all.\n\nI am having a hard time keeping my head up about this place. It reminds me a lot of the reasons why I wanted out of my city. My younger sister (16 months apart) and I had gotten real close before I left and it kills her knowing that I'm having a hard time here. It kills me, too. We go out sometimes, but I don't like getting into cars with people who have been drinking, and when I'm the DD, they constantly bug me to drink with them, egging me on before they even have their first drink. This was not the lifestyle I was told I would be having when I came here.\n\nI love my friend a lot. I can see that she's beginning to see that I'm having a hard time, as she's all of a sudden really sweet and nice, very comforting. I\"m not saying she hasn't always been like that, but she's been putting forth some effort these couple of days. It's been real hard. I call my parents and cry like a baby. I'm trying to hold out until May, but work is making it hard. I don't want to get a brand new job, as I've held this down for so long but they dislike limited availability in case I am to get a new one. My home district tells me to come on, that they know my worth. My younger sister says she has a bed waiting for me. My dad and mom say to come on. All I have to do is figure out how I am going to tell her that I am leaving before May. I don't want to give up before then. \n\nAs my next fresh start, though, my older sister moved to Minneapolis about seven years ago. We found out she was pregnant and due in July and she wants me to come up there and work as her live-in nanny. She has a spare room, a spot in the garage for my car. She works out and eats right, runs marathons and wants to train me to run them (something I was suppose to be doing here). She said she has connections to friends that work for magazines, blogs and publishers up there that I could talk to, as I enjoy writing and creating. My friend thinks I should do this. Everyone thinks I should try. Home isn't where I belong. Life seems to keep telling me to get out of here, try elsewhere. \n\nI apologize for the wall of text. I am 2000 words away from the text limit!\n\n**TL;DR Just moved here to get a fresh start and help a friend, but no matter what I do, things just don't go right. As soon as something starts to look up, something happens and I go right back down again.
