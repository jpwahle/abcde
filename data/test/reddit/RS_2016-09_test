My name's James and I'm 18 years old, so I'm fairly comfortable with NSFW stuff in RPs- though, if it makes you uncomfortable, that's a-okay as well! I'm a literate, 3rd-person and multi-paragraph roleplayer. I can write approximately 200-800 word responses, though, due to real life obligations I do get a little bit slow on RPs (I try for 1 per day, though sometimes it might be a little bit longer without it). Though I've had the most experience in M/M, I am fairly flexible as far as this is concerned and I can RP F/M, M/F and F/F.\n\nI am mostly interested in a murder-mystery storyline, I have a plot that I'll put down below for anyone that might be interested. However, if it doesn't interest you, I am basically looking for an almost adventure-type murder-mystery RP where we both double up on characters and play out the trajectory of a couple of characters with different motivations that are trying to achieve the same goals.\n\nSo! The beginning of the plot idea is sort of like Breakfast Club (if you're familiar with the movie) where a bunch of teenagers (all 18, so they're not underage) from different walks of life are in detention and on that fateful day, one of them manage to discover a dead body. They're very different of course, so some will clash, some might fall in love and some will get along, etc. I like the idea of the body being the result of a serial killer who is threatening the students to assist him/her. Perhaps they leave a message for these students to essentially frame someone else for the murder? And one of the students ends up keeping the note instead of handing it over to the police. Then, as the killer begins to badger and basically toy with the students, one of them gives in and frames someone for the initial murder to stop the harassment. Of course, this leads to a spiral. The police will notice the contradiction in evidence and the students would no longer be able to go to the cops for help unless they want to admit they broke the law by tampering with the crime scene. I was thinking, that this could very easily be a science experiment of some sort. Perhaps the killer is a disturbed individual attempting to explore a unique idea for his/her Ph.D. Or maybe, the parents of these kids were witnesses of a sexual assault case in which all of them testified that it was consensual and the killer is seeking revenge by targeting these children? \n\nThat's the first idea, it's just a general idea that could use some expansion and whatever. So let me know if you're interested! If you have any other murder mystery- or just adventure type ideas that involve different characters with different desires coming together as a result of the similar goal. If you want to incorporate fantasy elements/magic, I'd be all up for that too!\n\nI would also be up for a slice-of-life RP: teacher x student, boy/girl x best friend's sibling, boss x employee, etc. Anything you can think of really! I do have a plot for an artist x muse idea, though. \n\nHere's the plot idea: I was thinking one of the characters is an artist who was from a small town with big dreams and let themselves be caught up in those dreams, signing a contract with the first gallery that offered them some form of contract. I like the idea of them being obsessed with the fleeting nature of art and perhaps they believe that the brevity of the aesthetic is what makes it beautiful (kudos to whoever guesses who this is based off of XD). So having their works sitting in galleries, gathering dust wouldn't sit well with them. It would only be so long before they loses their muse. Now, second character.... I was envisioning this wild, carefree spirit who lives life like it's their last every single day and awfully spontaneous who drags the artist into the whirlwind of life (perhaps they break in the gallery to steal the artist's works to burn them?) or just anyone who would be able to restore that passion for art that the artist has. Of course, there would be pitfalls along the way because what fun would it be if there wasn't? Maybe the muse is a little too wild, maybe they can't be pinned down? What if they're into more dangerous things? What sorts of troubles would she have gotten themselves in already? \n\nAnyway, yup! Those are just some general ideas, feel free to change/alter it in any way you want! Or offer up your own ideas- I love ideas! \n\nIf you're interested, please comment below or PM me. I usually chat via Discord and RP via e-mail. I also have AIM and Google Hangouts for plotting too, so just contact me for all of that info. \n\nThank you!\n\n\n","stickied":false,"title":"[A4A: Calling All Murder-Mystery/Slice-of-Life RPers!]"}

{"over_18":false,"created_utc":1472688603,"selftext":"This'll be a little long. Sorry in advance!\n\nSo, my brother and I are 17 years apart. I'm 20 and he's 37. We've been super close our whole lives despite my mom's worries. Recently though, I'm not sure if I want to be...\n\nThis started around my 20th birthday. I wanted to celebrate where my brother lives (bigger town, more to do). He says \"Sure! What do you want to do?\" I said I wanted a small cookout with his friends (who are awesome), go to the zoo, and to shop a little. There was just one condition: NO babies at the cookout. He says \"Well, that rules out one of my friends but, hey, it's your birthday!\"\n\nSo some time passes and he texts me \"Hey, I totally forgot but (friend who has baby (I thought))'s birthday is that day too. Everyone wants to celebrate. Can they come?\" I ask if his wife can watch the baby. No, she'll be at work. I ask if grandparents can watch the baby. They don't live close.  I didn't respond for a while cause I didn't know what to say. On one hand, it's my 20th birthday and that is literally the one thing I said no to. On the other, it is that guy's actual birthday and we weren't even celebrating mine on the day of. I ask my mom and I say \"If they bring that baby, everyone is going to be all over it while my boyfriend and I sit alone in the corner on our phones.\" And she says \"Yep, That's exactly what's going to happen. But listen to me now: if you decide to let him come, and this does happen, I don\u2019t want to hear complaints.\" Well later that night, he calls me near tears saying \"I didn\u2019t know this would be such a big deal\" and \"I'll cancel the BBQ right now. I'll tell everyone it's off if that's what you want.\" Turns out my mom sent him my rant and scolded him about it. I don't like him being emotional so I say \"No, don't cancel! I want everyone to be there but I'm worried that the baby will get all the attention.\" And he says \"No, no! We see these guys all the time! Trust me, she won't take up all of us!\" And I think, ok he wouldn't lie to me, maybe this won't be so bad.\n\n WRONG.\n\nThe day stars off great. Plenty of turtles at the zoo, baby gorilla, new art supplies, the whole shebang. We get to his house for the BBQ (my brother's a hoarder and it's only gotten worse since the last time I saw him) and the first people there? Couple with baby. Not only did his wife not have to work, IT WASN'T EVEN HIS BIRTHDAY. The way my brother worded it, it sounded like it was baby guy's birthday. Nope, people with baby just wanted to come to celebrate other guy's birthday. I'm fuming but my brother spend a bit on food, so I didn't want to leave. \n\nWe settle inside. My brothers working the grill and every time he comes in, it's \"Hello there sweetie pie!\" just losing his mind over this baby. Other people show up but they're all, \"Hey! A baby! Let's be it's slave!\" And where am I? In a corner with my boyfriend on our phones. So we get to the food part, and the baby is tired but wants to stay awake so she starts crying. They calm her down then it starts back up again. ALL NIGHT. The parents didn't want to miss the party so they just let her cry saying, \"She'll cry herself out.\" Which happens right before we leave. I was so angry at myself for letting this happen. The only 20th birthday party I'll have and that's my memory of it. Not only that but a few weeks before this, he calls me all excited saying \"(Wife) FINALLY wants to try for a baby! I can't believe it!\" (This woman has many health problems and has said since before they got married that she was never having children. I think she said yes just to get him to shut up.) Then he spends every spare moment of my birthday talking about his future kid and what he's going to do with it. \n\nGuys, I\u2026 I love my brother but it's like he's been wearing a costume my whole life and he's just now taken it off. He's not the same. Him having a child is the worst idea possible. He's up to his eyeballs in debt, he's a hoarder, his wife has health issues. I think he's delusional. He thinks everything's going to be great but I only see the worst happening. I really want to tell him this cause maybe it'll wake him up but I don't know how\u2026 or even if I should\u2026 \n\nThoughts?\n\nTL;DR Brother manipulates me into having a child present at my birthday party, spends most of day talking about how much he wants kids, him having kids is bad idea, what to say?\n","stickied":false,"title":"[Rant][Advice] I need help on how to talk to my brother...","secure_media":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/50kdtf/rantadvice_i_need_help_on_how_to_talk_to_my/","media":null,"archived":false,"is_self":true,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qtwb","media_embed":{},"contest_mode":false,"thumbnail":"self","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit":"childfree","retrieved_on":1476374202,"locked":false,"link_flair_css_class":"rant","domain":"self.childfree","secure_media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_50kdtf","downs":0,"ups":30,"permalink":"/r/childfree/comments/50kdtf/rantadvice_i_need_help_on_how_to_talk_to_my/","author":"Blair888","score":30,"id":"50kdtf","link_flair_text":"RANT","author_flair_css_class":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"saved":false,"num_comments":16}

I read negative things about my country, my race, my weight (pro ana blogs, mostly), my habits, my hobbies, you name it. And once I get into it, I cannot stop for hours.

So today, we were transported to a park to do team building exercises all day! To most this may seem fun and full of possibilities, but despite being good at academic things (hence why I got into said professional program), I am utterly useless when it comes to focusing on anything happening in the real world and I find myself struggling to keep up on days where there are a lot of structured activities or where I have to pay attention to my surroundings. \n\nI was filled with this sense of dread and knowing that I would, somehow or another, manage to fuck up this day and royally embarrass myself as I always do. And man did I deliver. The first activity was a communication exercise, there were four people per group and we were presented with an array of shapes to arrange into a pattern specified by a diagram. Sounds easy right? Well the trick to it was that the person working with the shapes was not allowed to see the diagram, and sitting back-to-back with the person giving the instructions, who was not allowed to see what the builder was doing. \n\nThe other two people acted as observers who could see what was happening on both sides, but couldn't speak or make any gestures. We had formed a group of four, and I had unwittingly sat in the position that would later be assigned the builder, the toughest role and required a ton of concentration and awareness. To make it worse the room was super loud, so I could barely hear the instructions that were being spoken by the person behind me. Cue seven minutes of frantic maneuvering with the pieces and I only managed to arrange half of the pieces correctly before the time ran out. My mind had been racing with anxiety and unable to focus or process the instructions properly so i was desperately shifting around the pieces aimlessly. we were one of only two groups out of probably 30 groups that had failed to finish the puzzle when the time stopped and the other group members basically knew at that point i was a fuck up, nobody said anything but I could see it because next round they switched the builder, and nobody even looked or talked to me when we were strategizing for the next round, it was like i wasn't even there... \n\nUnsurprisingly the other two rounds we did much better, and at the end of the session the host of the event was talking anonymously about a guy in the first round who was not communicating back to his teammates and frantically shuffling the pieces aimlessly as an example of bad communication, my heart sank because I knew he must have been talking about me. I knew it and all my teammates knew it. I looked away in shame but tried my best to cheer up for the rest of the day. \n\nAfter a few more easier activities we went outside to have lunch, on our way back would you know it, turns out I had stepped in dog shit and didn't even realize it until i was inside and had the smell of fresh dung following me around everywhere (ADHD strike again! Why wasn't I looking where I was going?). Cue embarrassing 20 minutes in the bathroom trying to wipe off all the shit on my shoes with soap and water which made me late when they were starting the afternoon activities. \n\nMy inattention once again was made apparent quite soon during some of the intense group challenges, ones which required careful maneuvering as we had to get people across \"electric fences\" and devise plans to retrieve objects etc. I was trying so hard to keep up and just understand what was going on around me while all my teammates were so focused and effective and almost right away came up with step by step plans to solve each of the challenges, I felt like a huge load and totally worthless. \n\nI think most others knew it too, most of the ideas i DID suggest were not thought through very thoroughly and many were obviously stupid, by the end nobody took me seriously unless I shouted, and often times would laugh at the things that I said. Even our group leader laughed once. I felt like a colossal idiot but tried my best to keep up and feel like part of the group, I did pretty well on some simpler tasks and on following the leader so I mostly stuck to that and kept my mouth shut. \n\nIt was a bizarre and frightening state of mind, I had super intense anxiety and my mind was spinning like crazy, but all the while I was also in a trance like state where I didn't know what to pay attention to and became totally lost and clueless almost constantly. I also probably came across as rude because I sometimes have a hard time paying attention to my tone of voice especially when I'm frustrated, so I was often sounding like i was barking orders even when I just wanted to give some advice or help out. After the first activity nobody really trusted me to do anything by myself so at best I would wait until the plan was solidified and explained carefully to me before I did anything, and even then I was liable to fuck up, so I had to focus entirely on not screwing up majorly (which I managed to do, at least I didn't sabotage any group efforts I guess). After that was over thankfully we had a short discussion (talking about being a team-player and harnessing everyone's strengths-- heh, as if I had any strengths), and then the trip was mercifully ended and I slunk onto the bus home. \n\nSigh I guess I just needed to vent a little bit, especially in the professional program I'm in I realize very few people, if any, share my problem and as such I will continue to be viewed as an idiot and a klutz. What's worse I tried Ritalin but although it helps significantly, I'm a pretty thin guy wanting to gain weight so it doesn't help that it makes me sick to my stomach and never want to eat anything again. Feeling a bit disappointed and hopeless today as it was supposed to be a great week where I meet new people and find friends, but I feel beleagured and lost, and through this challenge it is apparent to me I will never succeed at anything significant.

It takes nothing to get hard. Very little to get off. Anyways. Got a job this summer and met a very very attractive girl. Months of flirting lead to us finally officially being a couple! Woo! Making out a lot and teasing each other for a week. Throughout this first week I just... lost the urge to jerk off. I'd get hard when Im making out with her but not like raging or anything it's just kinda there. But yeah. Haven't been getting hard since dating girl. Got her off today and that was fun but when she went to return the favor I just couldnt get past like half hard. I think I have anxiety about the work load of my incoming senior year. I just need an explanation. I'm 18. I dont think Im supposed to have erectile dysfunction. Am I nervous? I know Ive been having nightmares in relation to anxiety about juggling work, curriculars, and my school work. Could it be that? Please help. Shes so fucking sweet and attractive but I dont want her to think she doesn't arouse me. She really really does. Dick why you gotta be like this.

We are very close, I am capable and willing to help, but they will not listen.\n\nFirst, I do feel that one potential obstacle is that they still see me as their baby (I'm 33 and used to work in this field!) incapable of helping them with these decisions.  While that's an underlying issue to tackle, I also want share the specific situations and hear your thoughts:\n\n1.  My mom has nearly 0 risk tolerance, and her retirement savings have been sitting in cash or very low fixed income investments, letting inflation eat away for years.  When I bring up the topic of investing to support herself for the next 20-30 years, she just can't discuss it.  I'm even open to compromising on a conservative account that just keeps up with inflation, if it means maintaining her peace of mind.  But it stresses her out and she refuses to consider it.\n\n2.  My parents work with a financial advisor. This guy has a fancy at one of the major broker dealers, is successful, and came recommended, so my parents decided to place their money with him about 10 years ago.  The annual fee on their assets is 1.25%. My Dad's account has a set-it-and-forget mix of mutual funds and a few stocks that doesn't change.  Obviously, my Mom has little-to-no activity in her account.  That fee is just ridiculous for the level of service being provided - they don't have much use for him and only talk when he calls to pitch an investment (ugh).\n\nMy Dad's a bright guy, and I think he understands how portfolio fees work.  However, he has an old-fashioned mentality about having \"a broker to take care of that\" and doesn't like change.  I'm trying my best to motivate him, carrot/stick, but I'm not getting the job done.  The fact is: the cost of this financial advisor is equivalent to nearly 2 months of their annual expenses (that's not even counting the hidden mutual fund costs!).  My parents would be in such better financial shape if they just dropped the majority of their money in a simple ETF portfolio.  I accept that, one day, they'll have questions, and then hiring a one-time/hourly type of advisor is totally understandable (if Google or I can't answer them).\n\nI do become easily frustrated when I try to explain this to them, so that's one challenge I need to overcome (it drives me crazy that they have spent and continue to spend such a large part of their nest egg on this).  So assuming I can control my emotions in communicating with them, do you have any suggestions on persuading them to make good, though uncomfortable, decisions?\n\nThank you for your help!","saved":false,"num_comments":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"id":"50klth","link_flair_text":"Planning","score":0,"author":"tentack01","quarantine":false,"edited":false,"permalink":"/r/personalfinance/comments/50klth/how_do_i_convince_my_stubborn_parents_to_trust_my/","ups":0,"downs":0,"name":"t3_50klth","locked":false,"link_flair_css_class":"Planning","retrieved_on":1476374374,"subreddit":"personalfinance","hide_score":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"domain":"self.personalfinance"}

From experimenting it seems to be completely geographical, because if a character leaves the area there is no excessive loading for their dialogue, but once they enter \"the zone\" it's unbearable. I was able to test this  with Hattori during the Swords and Dumplings quest since his location changes during the quest.  (As an aside, I had just started performing the play when the update hit. By all rights, Dandelion should have died of old age.)\n\nI have also noticed 2 other things besides this and Vivaldi's arms.  1. The book merchant can now be found outside his shop, as well as inside.  Both can be interacted with and buy/sell books.  2. When I run down the street immediately south of the square (beside the canal) it sounds like I'm running through water.  I even dodged the puddles, but it still sounds like I'm sprinting through a marsh. \n\nNow my question is from a technical standpoint what is happening.  Explain it like I'm 5, because I am not a computer whiz. What generally would cause those long dialogue load times, and what about a new character look would cause this? \n\n(Tinfoil) I remember reading about a Wild Hunt assault on Novigrad and the technical limitations of consoles being why it was cut. Could they have tried to add this in/ is that even a thing developers do? \n\nMy logic behind this that the action would happen offscreen and you would come back to a destroyed square (explaining the displaced book merchant) and maybe the bottom street is flooded/the square is covered with snow. \n\nI have no facts to support this, it just seems that was a very large update and I don't understand why they would have risked breaking the game over giving a NPC a new look. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading and any \"behind the scenes\" programming knowledge.

I nearly had no money right in the middle of the month and I had spent half of it into a Game Project that wasn't working well. \n\nI ended up making a new HTML5 Multiplayer Game called massacre.io, selling that and another one, and also doing Freelance work for a few clients, to end with an income of **$2,026**. \n\nI am now developing **2 more** HTML5 Multiplayer Game Projects. Expected to be ready for publishing at the middle of September.\nTime Management\n\nI worked **72 productive hours** this month. **10** of them were dedicated to client projects, and took **11/31** days off.\n\n\n**Other Stuff**\n\nI was out for the #LDJAM36 which I lived in an event called GameBossJAM, placed in Zaragoza, Spain. Where I developed No Man's Sky 2D, in less than 48h.\n\nI am currently playing World of Warcraft: Legion, watching Cosmos and One Day was the best movie I saw this month. \n\n\n**Stats**\n\nThe games I develop were played a total of 88,427 times. I currently have 0 readers, and 177 followers on Twitter.\n\nThe traffic to my HTML5 Games is growing. Considering that I started making them 3 months ago, and back then I had **0 plays**.\n\n**Income Report**\n\nDuring August 2016 I earned **$2,026** solely online. As this is the first month since I started taking it seriously, I can't compare it to past months, but this section will have comparisons next month.\n\n(there is a detailed graphic in my site's blog entry that I can't insert here!)\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis was my first good month. It didn't start as good as it ended up looking tho, and I'm very confident on making more money next month! Things are growing in a stable way and I'm getting to know great new people to work with.\n\n**What's Next?**\n\nI will be releasing **2 more** HTML5 Multiplayer Games on **September**, and I'm already thinking on more projects for **October**.

{"title":"Really confused and in need of advice about my sexuality","stickied":false,"selftext":"Well, so with my story, I grew up being attracted only to women. I cant possibly count the number of crushes i had through out my life on school, church and work colleagues. When I started masturbating, the sheer thought of a pair of breasts would be enough for me to get off. I am really shy however and until very recently I never even kissed a girl (I am 23 now). From my 16s until now I have been using an awful lot of porn, always straight porn. However, recently i started to note that i was becoming more and more aroused by the thought of being in the role of the female being penetrated. Once I realzed that, I would try to imagine myself in the same scene, having homossexual sex, and that just wouldnt work for me, so I would dismiss it as just a technique my brain created to achieve orgasm quicker, having it nothing to do with my orientation.\n\nThree months ago I finally got a girlfriend I am deeply in love with. She the kind of extremely intelligent, funny and petit girl I always dreamed of. We are in long distance relationship, and one week before she came to spend a couple of weeks with me, I had a dream in which was literally seeking for cocks, just cocks unatached to any male body, pretty much like they are depicted in straight porn. I got extremely anxious and once my girlfriend came I coldnt get up fully not even once, not even to oral sex from her. it just made me even more scared, and the thought that I have always been a cleseted homossexual started to grow in my mind. I am not homophobic in the least bit, but the thought that all my life until that point had been a lie was what scared me the most, that the strong emotional bond I had with my girlfriend was just me trying to fullfil what society expected from me or something like that. I started to get anxious around men and started to have dreams in which I would gladly give oral sex to old men (it was always old men, with white hair, in a position of dominance over me).\n\nI finally took courage to talk with my girfriend about it and she was extremely understanding. She identifies as a bissexual herself. She suggested than I could be a bissexual myself and just discovering this side of me a bit late. She is also studies medicine and she also mentioned something called \"father hunger\", because of my dreams and of the fact I have little atraction to the male body itself and have no interest in a relatonship with a men, but since I had an extremely distant relationship with my father growing up and no other male role model around, I could be externating my unsatisfied need for male intimacy as sexual desire (she made it very clear that this \"father hunger\" hypothesis had nothing to do with true homossexual or bissexual orientations). Browsing through NoFap the idea that it all could be just a porn induced thing came to mind, so I am just extremely confused of what this all about.\n\nA few weeks ago, after reading a lot of posts here, i was starting to accept myself as bissexual. The problem is that i am starting to feel more and more curoius about how is it to have sex with a man, and I can sense a drop in my interest in being active with my girfriend. I cant get hard just by the tought of having sex with her, but it is true to any gay fantasy as well. This the only thing keeping me from being in peace.\n\nIf I am truly bissexual, is it normal? Is this just my \"bicycle\" making me feel confused? Will my desire to be the active partner with women come back, as I had it during pratically my whole life until now? I just love my girlfriend, and although it myght seen a little bit naive, I am sure she is the woman I want to share my life with. Sorry for the lenghty post written a little bit hastly and with a really broken English. Thank you in advance for all the help.\n\n(I posted this in the bissexual subreddit a while ago but it would be nice to receive a few more insights)","created_utc":1472693146,"over_18":false,"author_flair_text":null,"thumbnail":"self","contest_mode":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rt8z","media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"is_self":true,"archived":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/questioning/comments/50kptz/really_confused_and_in_need_of_advice_about_my/","media":null,"secure_media":null,"ups":8,"downs":0,"permalink":"/r/questioning/comments/50kptz/really_confused_and_in_need_of_advice_about_my/","name":"t3_50kptz","hide_score":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"domain":"self.questioning","link_flair_css_class":null,"locked":false,"retrieved_on":1476374440,"subreddit":"questioning","num_comments":0,"saved":false,"quarantine":false,"edited":1472750539,"author_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"50kptz","score":8,"author":"danrp92"}

{"selftext":"Hey Gaybros,\n\nI preface this that I deep down know what I need to do, just really need to talk it out though and here others thoughts from people that are completely objective. This is also unexpectedly a long read so kudos for those who stick it through and thanks.\n\nSo I've been dating my current boyfriend for a little over two years now and its been pretty great. We're the total opposite of each other but it works. We rarely fight and if there is a disagreement we talk about it instead of yelling our heads off. He's an overall awesome person, I love him and for awhile I saw myself spending the rest of my life with him cause there \"wasn't really\" anything wrong to indicate otherwise.\n\nA year into our two year relationship we stopped having sex. I know it was exactly a year cause it was around our anniversary, I was riding him and accidentally jammed him...something you don't really forget. We didn't have sex after that and for awhile I thought it was because I hurt him. A month had gone by and I expressed that we should have sex again playfully and he agreed playfully. Time went on and I started my last semester at college so life at least on my end got a little hectic. Either way we still weren't having sex. Months seemed to go by and nothing, we would have deep conversations about it and he said he was depressed and pretty much lacked a sex drive completely at this point (I'm 27 he's 32 currently). \n\nInitially during the dry spell he would say \"we'll have it soon\" which eventually turned into through our talks of him realizing that he's depressed and doesn't know when we'll have it again and hopefully it'll pass. I suggested he go to a therapist but he doesn't like them (he's gone to them before). I try to encourage him to go to the gym (one of the factors is that he wasn't happy with how he looked weight wise which was never a problem for me cause when we started dating he wasn't in the greatest shape to begin with). It's gotten to the point were its a spiraling circle of he just feels even worse for not having/wanting sex and I'm trying my best to make him feel comfortable and supportive and that I just want him to \"get better\". \n\nI do take some or the blame cause since we started dating he was usually always the one to really initiate sex and was always the norm and how we both settled. It wasn't till after we stopped having sex that he brought up that concern of me never being the initiator. At the same time though knowing the head space he is in I didn't want to make him feel pressured in the moment as so much time had passed already of no sex. To be clear by no sex I mean no forms of intimacy other than possibly cuddling at night.\n\nI've been patient trying to be supportive but my patience I think is finally coming to an end. It rattles me to think that out of our two year relationship over 50% has been completely sexless. Everything else is great for the most part but I feel increasingly guilty at the prospect of ending it over sex, which up until that point was wonderful. We talked to other day while he was away in overseas that he missed me and that he felt guilty for the situation  we were in. I comforted him but he even admitted that he felt bad that up until this point after our talks he took the \"lets see what happens approach\" instead of the lets actually try making physical changes. I even at one point suggested that we start forcing ourselves start \"dating\" again, going out to eat, museums, etc to hopefully jump-start something which he rebuffed as it was \"inorganic\" or \"unauthentic\" which is true but I was hoping it would jump start anything. At the end he said he really wanted to start making physical strides in fixing this. I was glad to hear that cause that's what I was hoping for the whole time but I feel like, for me, after waiting a year for some type of progress, after all the gym fail attempts, the failed therapy sessions, I've lost hope that this time will be different.\n\nI just feel incredibly guilty that the reason why I want to break up is that there is no sex. There are several other tiny reasons but nothing that compares to this whole problem. The reason I didn't do it before cause I felt like an asshole for even thinking of leaving when my significant other is clearly in pain/trouble. I compared it to almost leaving your bf/gf if they suddenly came down with cancer...its a completely dick move. I'm just tired of sitting around and seeing no progress and basically no effort to fix the problem which I guess it is overall in the end depression (I'm no expert by any means on the matter, I'm an engineer not a psychologist). I find myself frustrated all the time now and starting to realizing I'm completely sacrificing my happiness which there seems to be none of now. I feel even more guilty of choosing my \"happiness\" over this relationship. We've gotten to the point where I honestly feel like we're just really good friends who enjoy each others company instead of an actual couple. We've gotten dangerously comfortable. I don't expect intimacy everyday and totally expected it to slow down as the relationship went on I just didn't expect nothing, a year into it and us only being 27/32.\n\nI feel like I know what I need to do just dreading and feeling increasingly guilty about cause in the end, he is a great guy. Would  like to hear from you guys. Maybe I'm crazy and over thinking it or maybe I'm right. My mind (and pretty much my heart as corny as that sounds) is all over the place right now and I just need some good solid advice/direction/something.\n\nHopefully I represented both of us well enough cause I honestly could talk so much more about it in detail. Thanks for taking the time to read and thanks in advance for the (hopefully constructive) replies.

I like to play games, read, discuss comics, anything syfy or fantasy, etc. I use big words and I'm very logical. My social graces aren't the most graceful, but I treat everyone about the same and once you get me talking it's hard to stop me. I don't do emotional well, but I'll try to help if you're going through a hard time. I'm very considerate, if only because I've trained myself to be, but if you come to me with bullshit, I'm going to get frustrated. If you haven't noticed yet, I'm not the most eloquent writer, but I'm honest and I get all the facts out there. I'm a conservative libertarian, I'm a Christian, and I'm going to college for Sociology/Psychology. I'm 6'2, red hair, big dude. I have a tendency to mock people, but never to be mean.\n\nOne thing you should know is that my personality is kind of situational... or more aptly, I respond quite differently depending on the situation. For example, if we're just talking, I'm going to be pretty laid back and kinda goofy, but if we get into a dom/sub situation, I'm much more intense. I'm not the kind of guy who goes around all macho and dominant all the time. \n\nKink wise I'm really into control. I like to make rules, give tasks, plan activities, etc. I'm also into bondage, collars, spanking, gags, toys, suspension, body writing, nipple play, wax play, rope play, sensory deprivation, forced orgasms, butt plugs, human furniture, and the list goes on. I'll try almost anything once, though I do stay away excessive blood and bodily waste. I do like to keep my kink private, so I try not to venture into public play, though I do have some interest in it.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for beyond a submissive woman to control, but I have a special place in my heart for bratty pups who are eager to please. Also someone I enjoy talking to, but I enjoy talking to a lot of types of people, so that doesn't narrow it down a whole lot.","created_utc":1472693472,"over_18":true,"title":"21[M4F][D4s] in New Mexico.

I have also had joint pain, especially in my lower back and hips. I have noticeably thinning hair on the crown of my head, as well, but that has been happening slowly over the last few years (to my utter distress and horror).\n\nI have seen many doctors and had lots of blood work done. The things that stand out are elevated ESR (always elevated, every time I get bloodwork), zero eosinophils (could be due to taking prednisolone eyedrops for months), high white blood cells, and low Vitamin D.\n\nMy primary and ophthalmologist agree that this is likely autoimmune, but I saw a completely unhelpful rheumatologist and he had no idea. Just told me to stop getting tattoos, since they keep getting inflamed for no reason. I'm seeing another one next week, hopefully with better results.\n\nAnyway, this past week I've noticed two new things: my face feels...tight? It feels like my forehead is almost drooping, and I'm constantly lifting up my eyebrows to counteract the sensation. In the mirror, everything looks normal.

{"stickied":false,"title":"I'm sitting alone at lunch. :(","over_18":false,"created_utc":1472694790,"selftext":"I'm 16 years old in sophomore year, and I just started at a new school on Monday. I know what you're probably thinking: \"Monday was 2 days away, give it some time and stop complaining!\". But my anxiety has made it much more complicated than that. I have high social anxiety, but I managed it much better at my other school because I was with my friends/people I felt comfortable with all the time. I was semi-popular, and always had somebody to talk to, even if we weren't great friends. Here, I can barely speak, and I walk around in the halls with headphones in because I don't want anybody to engage me. In my creative writing class, I need participation points, and the only way to do that would be to read my journal entries out loud. The thought makes me want to break down crying. I think the worst part though, is lunch. My first two days, I sat alone under a tree, quite visible, hoping someone might come and say hi. Nobody did. Today, I took my mom's \"advice\" (her telling me that I need to stop feeling sorry for myself and get out of the little box I was hiding in) and walked up to a lunch table of girls. There were two open seats at the table, so I asked \"Can I sit here?\" to the girls at the table. They looked at each other and one of the girls flat out said no. I walked away, and decided to try again. I asked another table of girls, and when I asked if I could sit, they looked at each other and one even shook her head at the others. One girl said \"Sorry, out table is super full, everybody's just not here yet.\" When I looked over at the table from my spot under a farther away tree, there were still 3 seats open. I don't really understand why I'm not fitting in at all, I'm average, and haven't been there long enough to show my personality. My confidence is shattered. Starting next week when it's allowed, I'll be going to the library for lunch, because I can't deal with the humiliation of being out there, alone.

It's actually a bit embarrassing how it started because I realize that it does seem petty. A couple days ago it was my 21st birthday and there really wasn't anything that I had wanted or asked for. So the day rolls around and my parents wheel out this things filled with presents. A bit overwhelming because we're typically not a HUGE gift giving family, just a couple things on birthdays and Christmas. So here I am receiving 21 presents (get it? Clever right). Now my nMom had told me there are a couple \"jokey\" ones, which is fair. 21 presents later however, I now had 2 shirts I had no interest in, a pair of huge-looking unflattering yoga pants, some fluffy flip flop things, 2 pairs of pantyhose, some funny straws (???), some Crest White Strips (never used before or expressed any interest in them so, awkward?), a bag of Dollarstore chips, bag of unpopped popcorn, and a Popcorn machine (I'm sure I'm forgetting some but you get the point). Which I mean, YES that is a lot of stuff!! And yes I probably seem ungrateful for not liking it but I mean when a small bag of Kettle Cooked chips is one of the better presents... Idk. Apparently the Popcorn machine was because I had mentioned I wanted one a couple years ago, most likely when I was 14 and my friends got one, and my mother saw one on sale and got it. I mean maybe I AM ungrateful, but none of these presents really mattered to me. I would have been happy with like a giftcard to Sephora and a pat on the back but now BECAUSE she had gotten so many things I felt entitled to play nice and say thank you etc. Later on that day we went for dinner where I got treated like crap (which she denies), but that's besides the point.\n\nSO I go tonight to have a couple of the chips because hey, they weren't that bad, and they were magically gone! So I say \"Hey did you move the bag of chips that you got me?\" \n\nand mother says \"Oh... yeaaah those MIGHT be in the garbage.\" \n\nSo of course I say \"Wait what why.. there were still plenty left\" \n\nand she says \"WELL OKAY SORRY I was cleaning up because I ALWAYS clean everything up and I just thought you were done with them so I threw them out!!\" \n\nI was annoyed not because I didn't get my chips, but because she threw out one of the only birthday presents that wasn't terrible without saying anything to me. So I accidentally let it slip that those stupid chips were one of the only presents I actually liked and she frEAKED. I'm ungrateful, how dare I, she'll never buy me anything ever again, etc. Even my dad got in on it which he NEVER does. He never defends me to my face anyway, but he hardly ever sticks up for her either except for this time where it was a stern \"GO TO YOUR ROOM\" which, I'm 21 so, no? I tried to explain to my mom that I had no need or want for 21 presents and that I appreciated the gesture but I would have been fine with just a couple giftcards where I could have picked things out myself. My mother has a long history of buying me ugly clothes without my asking her to and getting mad at me when I don't like them, swearing to never buy me clothes ever again (WHICH I DON'T NEED OR ASK HER TO), rinse and repeat. So yes, the clothes she got me were HUGE (I'm a M-L mom, not an XXL but thanks for the vote of confidence). And now I'm the awful ungrateful brat that I usually am because I expressed that I didn't like them/won't wear them. \n\nAnyway, I know this is mostly on me because how else did I really expect her to react right? I just needed somewhere to vent because it was just even worse that my father was so vocally siding with her which he NEVER does, although it was probably because he had put his \"secret warning finger\" up telling me not to get into it with my mother, but screw it I'm an adult and I'm allowed to talk about my feelings so I did, which annoyed him. Idk but there it all is. Hope you all enjoyed the read lol.

{"title":"Somethings seriously wrong is going on with my sister - Part 1","stickied":false,"selftext":"&gt;Saterday 10:32 pm\n\nIts been two weeks since the \"**incident**\". Rebecca and some of her friends went for a hike to escape our recent loss. Our parents had died in a car accident, a drunk driver had been speeding it hit they're car it was about to blow, they couldn't get out in time. Rebecca and I have a 8 year gap, I'm 25 and she's 16. Since I'm her sister and I was old enough, I was given full custody of Rebecca. \nAnyways, after I got home from work I got a call from the police explaining what had happened. \"They got attacked by some sort of animal. Your sister was the only one we could find.\" The chief officer said. I was relieved yet terrified, what sort of a creature would do such a thing? I drove my car as fast as I could to the hospital, arriving in a short 10m. I ran inside, practically pushing aside anyone in my way. I shoved the hospital room 334 open and rushed to Rebecca's side. \"Hey, hey look at me. Are you okay?\" I cupped her face in my hands and pulled her into a tight embrace. \"I'm o-okay.\" She replied nervously. She was covered in dirt and mud, her short hair knotted and messy. \"What was it that attacked you?\" I asked impatiently as we both finally managed to calm down. She narrowed her eyes and shook her head, \"I don't know...\" I was relieved when they told me she could go home the next day and that she hadn't suffered any serious inguries. \"Your never ever going hiking here ever again.\" I joked, she chuckled weakly. \"I'll be back to pick you up tomorrow at around four o'clock.\" I told her, and turned to leave. \"Bye...\" I heard her say quietly. \n\nThe next day I went to pick her up. She was still in that dirty state. When we got home I sat her down with some tea. Then I went to fill the bathtub with warm water. \"Come over here. You gotta clean yourself up.\" I called out, while placing her new clothing on the bathroom counter. She walked into the bathroom and I went out, closing the door behind me. A few minutes later she came out of the bathroom, all neat and clean. \"Feeling better?' I said with a wide grin across my face. She nodded quietly and went over to her bedroom door, \"I'm gonna be in my room if that's okay.\" \"Yeah no problem...\" I added, a little disappointed. She went into her room and locked the door. That was the end of it till dinner. Nothing else really happened. Till that night.\n\nI woke to the sound of growling and smashing. I sat up, still half asleep I put on my slippers and knocked on Rebecca's door. \"Hey... You alright? I heard some... Noise.\" There were a few more growling and hissing, then she replied. \"I-I'm f-fine...\" I was hesitant to leave at first. Then I thought maybe it was her laptop on full volume or an animal had slipped inside and she managed to get rid of it.\n\n The next day I got up early to make breakfast, it was her first day of school after a long summer break. She didn't seem to be waking up so I decided to wake her. I walked over to her room and opened the door half way when Rebecca appeared holding a strong grip on the door, so I couldn't see inside of her room. \"Um... Hey, thought I'd wake you up. Want me to drive you?\" She looked terrible, bags under her eyes and even messier hair (minus the dirt, mud, and twigs). I was shocked to see her hair had grown from short to long, like she grew 20cm of hair since the last time I saw her, which was like last night. \"No, I'll walk myself.\" She replied hastily. \"I'll just walk.\" She added. I nodded getting back to my cooking. In the corner of my eyes I saw her hurry outside in a black hoodie and ripped jeans (also black). *odd*, I thought. She usually wears bright cheerful colours. It gave me a weird feeling to see her in dark colours. I heard the *click* of the front door lock. She usually rushed to breakfast too. This made me worried. I didn't want to force her to eat or anything. Nor did I want to be overprotective.\n\n An hour later I got a call from her principle, she said Rebecca was hadn't been in any of the classes. I explained to the principle what had happened to her and her friends and told the principle I'd deal with this as soon as possible.\n\nA few hours later she came back looking tired and disorientated, even worse then the morning. \"Want some snacks?\" I asked, trying to persuade her into talking to me. She shook her head and ran into her room, locking it. I was getting more and more worried, so I decided I would take a look at her room later. *I'll talk to her about skipping classes and eating more later* I thought, *she's probably still shaken up by what happened*...\n\nAt dinner she didn't appear, I left her dinner on the table and knocked on her door to tell her it was there. \"Thanks.\" Was her reply, but it was rushed and nervous sounding. I sat in my room across from her's, leaving the door open. a few minutes later I saw her leave her room. \"I'm going out, I'll be back before ten.\" She called. She hadn't touched her food though. But I didn't care at the time, my mission was to check out her room.\n\n I tiptoed slowly to her room, opening it a crack. The room was messy, like a plane had crashed right in her room. I opened it more to be stopped by something, I peered at the obstacle behind the door and saw it was her desk flipped over. Her bed sheets and pillows were scattered all over the place. Then I saw it, a plastic bag stuffed with many things inside it. Red stains were around the plastic bag and in some parts of the room, it was a dark blood red. A faint metallic smell wafted around the room. *What in the name of...* I stepped inside, peeking at what was inside. Dead rats (or mice, I couldn't tell), squirrels, and small birds. I gagged at the horrid smell. I ran out of the room and slammed the door shut. *Why was that in there?!* The question raced through my head. I felt a stabbing pain in my heart when I thought of the worst. *Was she experimenting on them?*... *Is she a serial killer?* ... *A sick person?*... I threw the thoughts away and immediately ran to my room. Locking the door and surfed the Internet for what this could possibly be. All I found was nonsense like vampires and werewolves.

I'm about to start my junior year of high school, and all the stress that entails. I'm going to be doing the AP program and look forward to the challenge. However I have a problem. My older brother has manic depression, OCD and anger issues. He is constantly starting fights that last up to four hours with my father and sometimes my mother. He has hit my mother. I have that particular argument recorded and her scream will always make me cringe. \n\nHe has not called me anything but \"cunt\" for the past two years. His mental illness seems to have come from nowhere and he has gotten progressively worse. When I was a fourteen year old freshman, I was simply confused and frustrated by the constant arguing. My parents would take it out on me whenever they were fed up with dealing with my brother. His grades dropped, he lost all of his friends, and he stopped regularly showering and cleaning his room. I remember breaking down in class when my teacher asked me why I looked so tired. My eyelids were swollen from having cried so much the night before. I also told my Spanish teacher a few months later. They were both concerned that it would affect my schoolwork. My parents said I was being selfish and dramatic. \n\nMy sophomore year, he gets even worse. In December he was arguing right outside of my door with my father and then hit my mother when he was aiming for my father. That's the video in which you can hear her screaming. School is getting a bit more difficult for me, and it's harder and harder to concentrate with all the tension in the house. During midterms, there is so much fighting that I don't get to study for my chem midterm until 9:00 pm. \n\nNo one seems to care how it's affecting me. Only a few weeks after being knocked to the floor by her own son, my mother tells me \"you know, you're part of the problem too! You sometimes take clothes out of my room without asking!\" (I do this because when she does laundry, she leaves my clothes in her room) She is in complete denial. In may, after my brother distracts me with his abuse for three hours as I'm trying to study for my chem SAT subject test, there is a huge argument and I come down and tell my parents that if the constant drama and arguments don't stop, I want to move in with my grandparents. They enjoy my company and are more than happy to take me in. The school offers AP classes and lots of interesting clubs. \n\nI agree to give my parents the entire summer to attempt to help my brother and tell them that of when I come back in August he is not better behaved, I will move out. I come back and lo and behold, he is not even remotely better. In the space of six days there are three major arguments that end in physical violence and cause screaming so loud that I can hear it from outside the house. \n\nI made the oh so great mistake of pouring hot pasta sauce into a plastic container, and my brother freaked out. He was hysterical, screaming at my mom and I. We refused to get rid of the plastic container, so he waited with a hygienic mask, gloves, and a plastic bag at the bottom of the stairs for TWO HOURS so that he could wrap up the Tupperware container and dispose of it when I finished eating. \n\nSomewhere during the insanity of that afternoon, I called my dad to explain and complain a bit, and when he came home he immediately sided with my mother that it was all my fault for \"triggering\" my almost 18-year-old brother. He was just spewing hatred, condemning my character, and blowing it way out of proportion. At one point he raised his hand like he was going to hit me. \n\nSo, I went by train to my grandparents' house, and with my parents permission, began the process of transferring to the new high school. We have a meeting with the guidance counselor set up for ten am tomorrow. My parents randomly decided to retract their permission, thereby hugely inconveniencing my grandparents and I and putting us in an awkward situation. They also accused me of being selfish, a drama queen, a pathological liar, having a \"psychotic break from reality\" and having anxiety. They see mental illnesses everywhere! Except when it comes to their son....\nSo as they are my parents, there is not much I can do if they decide to make me go home. They'll just keep me in that miserable house until I have a nervous breakdown. Am I too sensitive? Is this normal family behavior? Should I just drop it and go home to these people? Jesus Christ, I'm so fucking tired and worn out by trying to prove myself to them. I really don't want to go back.\n\n\n","stickied":false,"title":"Am I being overly dramatic?"}

(long)","stickied":false,"selftext":"I just found this subreddit yesterday night while googling searches related to the effects of being parented by someone with BPD. This search was due to a mother induced rage that occurred for an hour just before. My wife had just showed me some posts on facebook my mom had posted the past few weeks - all having to do with forgiveness, moving on, not dwelling on the past, etc. Including a post she did asking her friends on there to tell their thoughts about a quote she got from a book essentially saying that if you sit and squint hard enough on your past, then any aspect of it can be seemingly horrible or shitty even if it maybe wasn't. Don't worry, I saw that passive aggressive fast ball being thrown at me. All of those that responded said things along the lines of \"Said any millennial ever\", \"Kids these days are just so entitled. Things happen in the past, they need to get over it\". They sat and confirmed my moms view of me unknowingly. Adding fuel to the bullshit fire in my moms head, validating my moms thoughts without even knowing it was about her and I.\n\nI remember being really little and my mom rocking me to sleep while she hummed this specific rhythm. I remember holding my moms hand and squeezing it in a certain pattern that she needed to squeeze back to me. I remember her walking with me around the house in her arms as she sang \"I'm the only one\" by Melissa Etheridge. The last time I brought up that song, telling her I remember her singing it, she told me to let it go as if it was something negative I was holding onto.\n\nI think I was 12 when my mom died. Not literally. But that was when the love she had for me disappeared. This is when the distance between us grew, my need of her approval started to form, and this anger towards me took over her brain. She never wanted to hug me anymore, physically pushing me away and saying I was such a horrible kid that she didn't want to touch me.  I was told I was always being selfish, immature, disrespectful and lazy. Disrespect is a big one for her, which includes not agreeing with her opinions, to not doing absolutely everything she tells us to do. I was told I made her life miserable and a living hell multiple times. My ability to have friends was questioned because I had such a \"shitty personality\". I was always in trouble for \"talking back\" which I later found out from my step dad that all I ever did was defend myself. Our relationship dwindled to basically nothing, just full of yelling and fighting. \n\nWe could never have calm conversations. As I got older she would threaten me with money, telling me that if I didn't do exactly what she said that she would quit paying for things. I would spend years trying to make her happy. Thinking that I would eventually fix whatever it was about myself causing these issues, and then I could bring my mother back. \n\nAt the start of this year I started to go to counseling. All of my conversations with my counselor revolved around my mother. I soon had a conversation regarding the possibility of my mom having BPD. Obviously my counselor can't official diagnose, but we looked it up together and realized that my mom fits it to a T. She always plays the victim, manipulations and lies to keep a certain image, attacking my character in any argument, claiming I do not love her, saying mean and hurtful things throughout my life, unable to handle independence from her children - taking it as us abandoning her, being really good with younger kids due to the attachment aspect of the relationship, intense and uncontrollable emotional reactions to things, etc. She has held me to such higher expectations than my little brother, views him and I as in a competition, showing him affection and blatantly denying me of any. Most people blamed it on me being the oldest while also being her daughter. I also found out that she had taken my brother by his hair while he was in middle school, and swung him around. Then when she told family of the event, claimed that he was the one who raised a hand at her. He just found out a few months ago she had lied to the family and this event happened at least 6 years ago. \n\nI seem to be noticing more games she plays since I started to talk to someone. My eyes are open to so much more. A few weeks ago I called my mom to let her know that I am moving to Maryland. When she answered I could tell she was really upset. Usually this means there is a trap being set but it sounded deeper. She told me that she wanted to talk about her and I, our relationship. She doesn't like knowing that I go to counseling because of her. She never meant to hurt me or be such a horrible parent, and doesn't know why she did the things that she did. This phone call seemed so different. I heard her out, felt so horrible about her being upset. Then dropped the bomb that I am moving to Maryland because my step dad offered to let my wife and I move in. This seemed to have hit a switch in her brain and allowing this conversation to take a turn. She started telling me that this was a huge mistake, she's getting older and won't be alive forever (she's only 48), my grandma isn't going to live much longer (she's a healthy 72), and that I need to think harder about this. She started to tell me that it is my wife's fault that we are having such a hard time making it on our own even though we ARE making it on our own and we are only 25 anyway. She tells me I should own a house by now, and my generation is so lazy, that I should be the one hosting the holidays at my house despite that there are 5 other cousins older than me who have never been pressured to do it. Just all this fucking bullshit. THEN, she sends me a text a few days after listing 5 reasons I shouldn't go. Most of them had to do with my little brother, saying how I am just setting myself up for a stressful living situation where I will be in competition with him again. She told me him and I would just fight even though him and I don't even fight. That this is my chance to be with my family without him around.. As if him being around just doesn't allow me any family time? And that he is going to be getting a REALLY nice car, so why would I want that in my face? My car is great. Then it clicked that she is actually taking my confession of resentment toward my brother I had said in the phone call before, and using it against me so I won't leave her. She told me counseling is a waste of time, I just need to move on because she can't fix anything in the past, and told me that I can choose to be anyone I want to be right now and the things that happened when I was a kid do not shape me. I NEED TO JUST MOVE ON.\n\nI haven't really talked to her much since March. It was decided by my counselor and I that I needed to cut as much communication out as a I can so I can establish boundaries. She can control my emotions so easily that it is disgusting. I can be so pissed off at her one second, then feel like a guilty piece of shit for treating her bad, even though I never do. I told my mom she was and always has been the center of my universe, and she quickly told me that I was lying. I am 25 years old and currently reliving my entire life with the final realization that there is nothing I could have done to keep my mom happy. I wasted so much time trying to do everything \"right\", doing everything she wanted me to do because I thought I was causing these super shitty bad moments in our lives which was getting in the way of the good times Taking up their space. But now I realize the the good times were actually MOMENTS, and the bad shit was the constant. That one hit me hard. So fucking hard. I am still practicing limited communication with my mom, and working on bettering my relationship with other important people in my family that she brainwashed me to stay away from (like my biological dad and my step dad). I am learning to trust myself, make decisions based off of MY happiness, and trying to figure out this life thing while repairing the past. Maryland is going to be a clean start for me. My step dad is such a wonderful and positive man. I think it's going to allow me to breathe. I hope to continue posting here and maybe make some friends along the way. This post is probably all over the place, so I apologize if it is a shitty read. Please feel free to talk with me when ever. I appreciate all of you guys coming together like this and maybe we can all help each other make sense of this shit.\n\nP.s.

{"created_utc":1472698440,"over_18":false,"selftext":"The Greeks believe that theatre is an essential teacher for society to learn to behave in unusual circumstances--empathy is an amazing teacher and seeing an actor deal with death, incest, heartbreak, and other extraordinary situations educates the audience on how to manage the feelings in the moment should they ever come across that situation.\n\nThough I'm new to TRP, I don't think I've seen an attempt to collect a comprehensive set of TRP-style principles to live by and examples that people have encountered to feel and learn from.  I see a lot of theory in different posts that is sometimes disconnected from practical examples, and I'm hoping that we can use this post as a work in progress to create a rock-solid education for newcomers and reinforce gaps that experts may have.\n\nThat being said, I suggest that everyone post their examples and discuss them in the comments, and I\u2019ll try to keep the post up to date as more good examples come up so the body of this post becomes a clean and crisp guide.\n\n**Principles &amp; Examples**\n\n**NOTE: I am describing the 'Benevolent' type of Alpha that Redasshole mentioned in comments below.  This is what I align with philosophically because I want to build up society so my life doesn't suck in the future by poisoning those around me.  There are other Alpha types and I may write up a post about it later.  You need to decide what type of Alpha aligns with you and stick with it, but understand the consequences of your choice.**\n\nMany of these principles are my own and some may not fit the TRP principles, but I\u2019m not 100% which disagree since I haven't seen a good collection of these principles.  If any strongly disagree with TRP after seeing the ensuing discussion, I\u2019ll strike it out with the rationale, but this can be a starting point for us to discuss.\n\n**Be independent.** Dependency is crippling in life.  Buddha preaches that freedom and happiness comes from the absence of want or need.  There is nothing more beta than needing someone there, or wanting someone more than respecting one\u2019s self.  An alpha needs nothing; though we want and we strive to satisfy our desires, we must not need anything more than our self.\n\n* I\u2019m working a girl right now that I\u2019ve hooked up with (says she likes me, that she\u2019s attracted, and apologized for her behavior for a minor infraction), and I desire to spend more time with her, but she\u2019s confused (translated\u2014probably playing games) and suddenly things are no longer fun for me because she\u2019s acting foolish.  So, I\u2019m simply ignoring her for the next week.  I\u2019ve told her straight up that I won\u2019t put up with foolishness and I have options, so I\u2019m going to be consistent with my frame, be independent, and freeze her out.  If she reaches out, I may give her a shot after being straight up that I\u2019m not interested in people that play games.  \n\n* Some time goes by without dates, activities, plans fall through because of the weather, etc, and I feel like a loser.  So, I crush that feeling.  I go for a run, do some yoga, setup plans to hang with friends, go read, listen to music, and remind myself that my unhappiness is not dependent on others and I don\u2019t need others.  Embrace the solitude and learn to weather the downtimes\u2014eventually, you may grow to treasure it.\n\n**Earn the right to be respected, and then demand it** People don\u2019t deserve respect\u2014they earn it.  This goes for friends, coworkers, bosses, family, etc.  Respect is earned in various ways, but it generally comes from some form of excellence: impressive performance, impressive mindset, impressive connections, etc.  You can fake it till you earn respect, but that is harder and less fulfilling than being worthy of legitimate respect.  \n\n* I had a girl flake on me because of a real-estate transaction on the 2nd date.  She, last second, was contacted by her realtor to put an offer on a home.  She didn\u2019t communicate well and apologized the next day saying that she was stressed and was sorry.  I told her I expect better communication and that she would have to setup the next meetup if she wanted to see me again.  She didn\u2019t, but that\u2019s fine because the mentality is that she isn\u2019t worth my time because she doesn\u2019t respect me.\n\n* Saw a post regarding dealing with flakes and the discussion moved to dumping her or trying to get laid.  I believe that continuing to entertain that flake is disrespectful to one's self and the path to being an alpha, so one might get laid short term but one will also achieve less long-term.\n\n**Actions matter more than words\u2014act, don\u2019t talk.** My mother suffers from crippling case of \u2018talk about things and not do them because I feel good after talking about it\u2019.  Most of the world is this way, and it kills motivation, progress, and you should kill this behavior since you likely do it.  Because of this, she will never improve her health and will die young just like the rest of my family, regardless of what I do to try to help her.  Don\u2019t talk if you can act.\n\n* I was on a date and the woman I was meeting asked me: \u201cwhy online dating\u201d.  I told her that it\u2019s a fun challenge and that meeting people day-to-day is easy for me because I just go up and say \u2018hi\u2019.  Later that night, we\u2019re at a pool hall / bar, and in the time there I spoke to several groups of people and incorporated us into them.  That lit her up and her hands didn\u2019t come off of me the rest of the night.  Sure, I spoke about this before doing, but the key is that the action spoke more than the words ever could.\n\n**Avoid the unfortunate like the plague.** Stripped from 48 Law of Power, obviously.  You are who you surround yourself with because perception is reality and others will perceive you as lower at the very least, and you\u2019ll be poisoned by the unfortunate at the very worst.  Find people you admire, find a way to befriend them, and continuously improve your circle of close friends.  People are failures often because of their mindset more so than their situation.\n\n* I\u2019ve seen many posts emphasizing this principle\u2014just read a TRP example about a guy that caught a hot woman but his friend was such a douche that she just ditched him.  \n\n**Don\u2019t speak ill of others.** Alphas don\u2019t need to bring others down, and, even if true and correct, it lowers one\u2019s value.  Furthermore, it raises concerns that you speak about others behind their back.  Nothing good comes from this except in the political realm, and, even then, it\u2019s a last-resort tactic.\n\n* I killed it on a first date with a woman because we went to see my friend\u2019s band, got backstage, etc.  She wanted me to come over but her mother was flying into town that night\u2014and she made plans to see me again immediately.  While going to a movie on the 2nd date, I made a joke regarding some of my friends saying, \u201cfree drink if you can spot the alcoholic\u201d.  It was in jest because all of my friends rock, but she didn\u2019t realize it.  Turned cold that same night and said she doesn\u2019t have romantic interest but wants to be friends.\n\n* CoupDeGrace22 brought up a great nuance to this point.  Shit-talking can be entertaining and a useful tool such as for building rapport.  If you do it, don't be emotionally invested in it and make sure that the listener won't think you will talk badly about them behind their back or that you trash talk those around you / belittle your circle.  \n\n**Always aspire to greater heights.**  Alphas aren\u2019t static\u2014they always grow because staying on top requires a never-ending commitment to excellence.  Women get turned on by dreamers, and we can program ourselves by aspirational thought (key word\u2014thought, not talk).  So, you\u2019ve got a funny double-edged sword here.  You can talk about your lofty goals and turn women on and possibly kill your motivation to achieve, or you can achieve and let your actions speak for themselves.  Fix it by talking about great shit that you\u2019ve done that aligns with your aspirations, but keep what\u2019s coming up next to yourself.\n\n* On my second date with a stunner, I changed my whole persona from the funny, goofy, intellectual, romantic to the dynamic dreamer by going for a walk after dinner to the lakeside and talking about what I\u2019m struggling with\u2014trying to find my next goal because I\u2019m almost done achieving my current ones.  That switch in persona added depth to me, hit all of the right buttons with her, and the night was done.  It was genuine too because I\u2019ve been so focused on becoming more in control, and more alpha, that I\u2019ve lost sight of establishing a genuine goal I care about.\n\n**Help others, in the right way.**  Alphas are in positions to help, but not everyone is deserving of it.  Giving help solicited or unsolicited, can be absolutely sexy and is the right way to live if done right.  Help those who are willing to help themselves is the general rule, but it\u2019s not always clear so less is more with this principle.\n\n* On my last day in Singapore, I was headed out of the subway tunnel and saw a crowd thirty or forty strong.  Turns out, three teenage girls were fighting.  I thought it was stupid so I walked up and broke up the fight without hesitation.  Afterward, some random dude that watched that happened to be Australian buys me a fucking Fosters in the middle of my double-date, and that was done and my date was won.  The old me would have commented and watched, but that was a turning point in my life because hesitation is for losers.  \n\n* Remember school, where the girl asks for help with her homework?  Cut that shit.  Help her learn an idea but don\u2019t do her homework for her.\n\n**Don\u2019t hesitate.**  Incorrect action is often better than no action, since failure is a great teacher, and without action there cannot be failure.  There is nothing more beta than waiting, so stop waiting.\n\n* Meeting up someone for the first time and her body language is quite friendly from the moment I see her and a big smile lights up.  So, I give her a peck on the lips as I greet her because it felt right.  Old me would\u2019ve waited to get to know her first and time it to conventional moments like \u2018goodnight\u2019.  That\u2019s stupid\u2014kiss someone when you want to so long as you won\u2019t get hit with a sexual harassment claim.\n\n**Learn to listen.  Great men listen and don\u2019t speak.**  This is also from 48 Laws of Power, but the principle extends easily to dating.  People like to feel important, and being listened to strokes a person's ego quite well.  It also puts you in a position of power because you learn a lot and divulge nothing thus creating an air of mystery.\n\n* I don\u2019t have a great example of this, but I implore you to recall dates where you didn\u2019t shut up and see where those went\u2014probably worse than Donald Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\n**No response is better than a bad response.**  This seems to conflict with the principle above, \"Don't hesitate\".  The nuance is that being deliberate is very important.  In some tense moments (e.g. fight breaking out), you need to drill instinct into yourself so that you instinctively behave properly since messing up can get you killed or seriously hurt.  For other, not life-threatening situations, withhold a response with a poker face until you know how you want to respond.  There is probably a better way to dig into this principle, but maybe an example will help.\n\n* From makechangegreatagain: \"I was out with my girlfriend a few years ago, and some fucking loser at this party we're at decides to say some rotten things to her because she wouldn't accept his advances.. So I sucker punched the dude a few times and fucked his face up a little bit. But in the end, all his boys jumped on me, beat the shit out of me and I had to get some stitches at the hospital.. Luckily I had my clique there to back me up and break it up before it got too bad.\"\n\n* From CopperFox3c: \"As I've gotten older, I lean more toward BlackDragon's approach to flaky or disrespectful behavior with women. No contact and soft nexting are key tools in a TRP man's arsenal. A man's power come from his willingness to walk away. But you DON'T have to burn bridges to do it, be butt hurt, tell them to fuck off, etc. Sometimes you just have to leave, and let them come to you if they want.\"\n\n**Acknowledging weakness is strength.**  We are proud and don't want to expose our faults, but exposing them differs from acknowledging the exist.  Whether you choose to workaround the flaw or work on it is up to you, but being ignorant of it is beta.  If I'm 4 feet tall, I'm not going to delude myself into thinking that I'm a good basketball player--I may be good for my height, but that is a crippling disadvantage in the competitive arena.\n\n* I see this a lot in TRP for various reasons.  Men are jaded and frustrated with women or their lives, so they overcompensate by acting tough online in an anonymous forum.  That isn't strength--that is delusion and cowardice and it keeps you in the beta world.  \n\n* I used to be incredibly shy with a self-defeating attitude, but it only got better when I acknowledged it and worked on it because that wasn't the person I wanted to be.\n\nI\u2019m out of time for now, but I\u2019ll keep adding to this over the next few days.\n\nCheers,\n\nTrodjinn\n\n\nEDIT #1: Added more principles and folded in an example from discussion\n\nEDIT #2: Tossed in a great bit about Alpha types","stickied":false,"title":"Principles to Live By &amp; Examples to Learn From","secure_media":null,"media":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/50l3tj/principles_to_live_by_examples_to_learn_from/","archived":false,"is_self":true,"gilded":1,"distinguished":null,"contest_mode":false,"media_embed":{},"subreddit_id":"t5_2ve1u","author_flair_text":null,"thumbnail":"self","retrieved_on":1476374656,"subreddit":"TheRedPill","locked":false,"link_flair_css_class":"rp","domain":"self.TheRedPill","hide_score":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"name":"t3_50l3tj","downs":0,"permalink":"/r/TheRedPill/comments/50l3tj/principles_to_live_by_examples_to_learn_from/","ups":251,"link_flair_text":"Red Pill Example","id":"50l3tj","score":251,"author":"Trodjinn","author_flair_css_class":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":1472843473,"saved":false,"num_comments":45}

I'll try to keep this as short as possible.\n\nBasically, I graduated with a BA in urban planning in 2014, and have been working customer service/retail jobs ever since. I don't think jobs of this variety are mentally or physically easy on anyone, but I have struggled immensely with them because I am heavily prone to anxiety and depression. I have battled both since I have been old enough to be cognizant, and have dealt with them with varying degrees of success in a few different ways (therapy, self help books, etc). I think it's a part of me no matter what, but I have no doubt in my mind that there is something about jobs that deal with the vast public and are super fast paced that just simply doesn't meld well at all with my personality. It is, however, all that I have been able to find, despite my efforts of looking elsewhere. But I think that part of the problem is knowing where to look. This problem is made more complicated in the following ways:\n\n-I have thought about continuing into graduate school within my field of urban planning, as that seems to kind of be the \"entry level\" for many jobs. I think that it would also give me an opportunity to narrow down on the particular things about urban planning that interest me (housing affordability, demographics). I also LOVE school and academia. I did a double major in undergrad and couldn't get enough. However, I had to simultaneously work what was essentially a full-time work schedule and my grades greatly suffered. Most programs require a 3.2 minimum GPA, and I have a 3.24, no volunteer experience, and distant rapport with former profs who would have to provide reference. I am too scared to apply.\n\n -Also, more school, is more money. There is no way I would qualify for funding. I am already $30,000 in student debt from undergrad. This is an absolutely debilitating source of anxiety for me, made worse by the fact that I haven't even started to pay them off because my wages hardly even cover my cost of living (even with shared accommodation with a roommate, budget everything, nothing fancy at all).\n\n -I don't have very many practical skills. I am a musician and songwriter and have made some money performing professionally in the past. However, I am not naive to the amount of money and energy that would go into trying to make this a profession that I could sustain myself on, not to mention the huge gamble that it is. I don't know if it would be responsible to try to go down this path, although it is my \"dream\". One of my inner battles right now is figuring out how to let myself give up on it. \n\n-I also can speak a second language, although not particularly well. This doesn't really put me that far ahead because I live in an area where everyone can speak two languages, and it's an expected skill, not an asset. If anything it sets me back. I did a double major in literature, and love writing and reading, so the idea of being a translator has also crossed my mind. It would take a lot of years of concentration and schooling to polish my second language, but I think I could get there. The idea of a job that involves writing, even if it's for translating practical instruction manuals, really appeals to me. Especially if there would ever be a chance of me working from home. But, again, more school = more money. \n\n-Other careers I've thought of that might fit my quiet/laid back/low stress/independent personality: court stenographer, travel agent, librarian.....literally really nothing else.....so I'm definitely looking for suggestions.\nI don't care if I'm making a ton of money. I have never made more than $25,000 a year. Anything would be an improvement for me. This pit of clueless despondence in which I am currently stuck is SO not a good look for me. I want to feel the momentum of my life moving forward, towards bigger and better things.\n\nIf you made it this far in reading this, you're pretty awesome.\n\nTL;DR: I'm 24, I have a double major university degree, and am completely lost and drained working customer service jobs. Is there a career out their whose existence I don't even know that could possibly fit my requirements for independent and low stress work?\n","created_utc":1472699338,"over_18":false,"title":"24 and completely lost and discouraged.

I \"started\" smoking weed once or twice when I was 16, but never really started nightly until I turned 17. At the time, it was something that was really great because it helped me cope with all of the high school bullshit I was facing, and regular life difficulties that I just didn't want to deal with at the time. However, about a year later I'm 18, about to start college and I have been faced with the task of my placement tests. I've been procrastinating for little over a month now to take it because I've been so goddamn scared of fucking it up, and this morning I'm finally going into take it after a night of incessant worrying and destructive thoughts. The only dream I have in this world that I want to accomplish is earning a comp sci degree so I can become a programmer. I have tried to learn programming by myself over the last few years, but it's never really took off because I wasn't able to understand it very well. I never thought much of it, but until I started to study for trig/geometry on my placement test I felt like this weed habit has actually damaged me. Some of the algebra and geo came easily but the stuff that did not was just so incredibly difficult for me to do. I was staring at the problems, explanations and solutions withi a total confusion. I feel like I'm damaged, and I'm so scared for my future. Im 5 days clean now, and running on about 3 hours of sleep every night for about the past week. I never wanted it to turn out this way, but part of me believes that it's been so long I've actually applied myself to mathematics that I've forgotten how hard it is. But the other part of me tells me all of the articles on the internet about the developing teen brain under the influence of marijuana results in an inability to problem solve and critically think, are true. If anybody has any similar experiences, I would really love some input. I'm willing to work through this, I just need to know if this will go away, and the normal me will come back. \n\nThank you everyone, I appreciate it a lot. \n\nSorry If it's a rough read, but I'm on the bus currently.
