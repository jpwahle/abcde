The only place open is the Connection Cafe, an all-you-can-eat buffet style cafeteria that is relatively cheap for students, and free for myself, since I work for the company. So, I went and ate.. and ate I did.\n\nI had a burger, three huge helpings of fries, and four slices of pizza. This was the type of eating I could do before I lost 30 pounds.\n\nI won't lie that most of this has to do with me being an emotional eater, with a mix of everything else. Russia was a huge jump-start for me, as the ONLY fast food places I saw were Subway and McDonalds. (Side note: I don't know what they do in Russia to their sandwiches, but that was the BEST Subway sandwich I had ever had. It might have been because I was drunk that night, but hell, it was so delicious.)\n\nBack to the point. When I was in Russia, we ate a lot of typical Russian food, with fresh veggies, meat, potatoes, etc. Only in Voronezh did I actually eat some McDonalds, but it was worth it, since you had to practically walk a mile to get it. We walked everywhere. It was warm, and I lost probably 15 pounds there. When I got back home, my boyfriend Clinton's diet had changed (he was hospitalized two weeks before I left for Russia because of undiagnosed diabetes. His blood sugar was 762. He almost died.) and so did mine, because I wasn't about to eat Taco Bell in front of the man. And I kept losing weight, even as I started the fall semester. But when I got to the 250s, the weight loss stopped. I knew this was a plateau, and so I kept doing what I was doing.\n\nThe weight still didn't change. And Clinton, who wasn't exercising like I was, was still losing weight. The man is down to 237 pounds, and I'm stuck at 260. And every turn, Clinton's mom constantly talks about how much weight he's lost and how proud she is of him. Don't get me wrong, I'm incredibly proud of him as well. He looks great. He took his disease and decided to work with it to hopefully kick it.\n\nNow, I don't have a big risk of diabetes, but I do have a risk of heart disease. On both sides of my family. I'm 26, not getting any younger, and yet I just can't seem to do this and push through. When I go to the gym, I see these girls that run in laps around the gym, and they look fantastic, and then I see the guys lifting weights who are looking at said girls, and I wish I was one of them. Let's face it, guys do NOT look at me, unless I am saying to them, \"Hi, welcome to We Proudly Brew (a version of Starbucks), what can I get for you today?\" There is only one person who finds me physically attractive, and I'm not even really sure why. I sure wouldn't be.\n\nI recorded one of my lectures for class (I teach a Biology lab two days a week), and I took a look at it, and it was hard to watch. I got a glimpse of what everyone sees when they look at me.

The only place open is the Connection Cafe, an all-you-can-eat buffet style cafeteria that is relatively cheap for students, and free for myself, since I work for the company. So, I went and ate.. and ate I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a burger, three huge helpings of fries, and four slices of pizza. This was the type of eating I could do before I lost 30 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t lie that most of this has to do with me being an emotional eater, with a mix of everything else. Russia was a huge jump-start for me, as the ONLY fast food places I saw were Subway and McDonalds. (Side note: I don&amp;#39;t know what they do in Russia to their sandwiches, but that was the BEST Subway sandwich I had ever had. It might have been because I was drunk that night, but hell, it was so delicious.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to the point. When I was in Russia, we ate a lot of typical Russian food, with fresh veggies, meat, potatoes, etc. Only in Voronezh did I actually eat some McDonalds, but it was worth it, since you had to practically walk a mile to get it. We walked everywhere. It was warm, and I lost probably 15 pounds there. When I got back home, my boyfriend Clinton&amp;#39;s diet had changed (he was hospitalized two weeks before I left for Russia because of undiagnosed diabetes. His blood sugar was 762. He almost died.) and so did mine, because I wasn&amp;#39;t about to eat Taco Bell in front of the man. And I kept losing weight, even as I started the fall semester. But when I got to the 250s, the weight loss stopped. I knew this was a plateau, and so I kept doing what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The weight still didn&amp;#39;t change. And Clinton, who wasn&amp;#39;t exercising like I was, was still losing weight. The man is down to 237 pounds, and I&amp;#39;m stuck at 260. And every turn, Clinton&amp;#39;s mom constantly talks about how much weight he&amp;#39;s lost and how proud she is of him. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I&amp;#39;m incredibly proud of him as well. He looks great. He took his disease and decided to work with it to hopefully kick it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;#39;t have a big risk of diabetes, but I do have a risk of heart disease. On both sides of my family. I&amp;#39;m 26, not getting any younger, and yet I just can&amp;#39;t seem to do this and push through. When I go to the gym, I see these girls that run in laps around the gym, and they look fantastic, and then I see the guys lifting weights who are looking at said girls, and I wish I was one of them. Let&amp;#39;s face it, guys do NOT look at me, unless I am saying to them, &amp;quot;Hi, welcome to We Proudly Brew (a version of Starbucks), what can I get for you today?&amp;quot; There is only one person who finds me physically attractive, and I&amp;#39;m not even really sure why. I sure wouldn&amp;#39;t be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recorded one of my lectures for class (I teach a Biology lab two days a week), and I took a look at it, and it was hard to watch. I got a glimpse of what everyone sees when they look at me. Granted, I had my hair straightened and had some make up on, so I looked pretty for the most part, but the rest of my body I could have done away with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is what I don&amp;#39;t understand.

I don't have anyone to speak to. He has housemates here, but I'm not really sure how to have a proper conversation with them. \nI've always been a bad one for having mood swings. But since being here they've gotten worse. I constantly go in moods with my boyfriend. I feel like I'm getting too attached to him now that I'm here. Since I don't know anyone I'm sort of like \"speak to me, speak to me, SPEAK TO ME\" I guess maybe it's because i've been feeling quite low and lonely here. \nMy boyfriend left today to go on holiday with his family.

I live inside my head and my life is just uncertainty. Doubts abot everything and everyone, including myself. I feel hollow, numb, empty yet strangely kind of alive. I think it's sadness. I only feel it in my stomach though, I don't know, it feels like an abnormal sadness. It's not in the pit of my stomach; but slightly there, lingering and pulsating like a little ember. It's not in my face. My face feels flat.\n\nI'm lonely, really quite lonely, and bored. Very bored. I feel 'dead'. I'm afraid to watch the time go away; I mean, after all, these are supposed to be the best years of my life. I'm 16, and I'm never going to be 16 again, you know? I can't just sleep it all away. But... being awake is just some twisted, passive, torment. I don't enjoy *anything*. The part of the day I look forward to most is drinking coke, for the caffeine. But even that's starting to lose its enjoyment.\n\nI could probably get out of this quite easily you know. Phone some friends. Get some bus money from my mum. Go meet them. Hang out, feel better. But it's ironic; I just can't seem to find the energy, or the motivation. So much effort. I'm so conscious all the time. I feel so disconnected and alienated from EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING. What is wrong with me? What is wrong with me? What is wrong with me? I just want to be fucking normal but I'm cursed... somehow. I doubt my \"friends\" even care about me half as much as I care about them. I don't even exist to anyone outside of school.\n\nI used to hide away online, you know? That was my thing... when I was younger, I was not social at all. Abusive father may have had something to do with that, I don't know; maybe I'm reaching. Kind of wish I had a normal father though. Someone to be there for me as I was growing up. More than just my mother. I don't want to take it out on her but... g'ah... it was just not enough to only have her. Or that's what I feel like. Goddamnit. I never get sad anymore but the one thing that never ceases to make me tear up is when I ask the question, 'Why, dad? Why did you have to hit mum? Why did you have to be so violent? Why couldn't you just have been NORMAL AND LOVING AND UNDERSTANDING AND ATTENTIVE\"? I was so fucking scared of you growing up... the first time I saw you after you moved out... I was shocked. I was so shocked. I told you I love you, but I'm still not sure to this day if I ever meant that. You put me on the spot a bit. You always told us you loved us, FUCK YOU. If you loved me then... I look on TV all the time and I see normal, happy families. Loving parents. I feel like you stole my life.\n\nI can never feel comfortable with my step-dad. Everything is shit. Anyway... I used to hide away online. I'd go home, get on my laptop, and just waste away those hours. When I was young and ambitious and full of energy, anything seemed possible. Hours, hours, hours, HOURS UPON HOURS of me just LEARNING, and discovering new content... and my neighbour was there for me. :C He's gone now. Why did everything disappear so quickly? I loved my neighbour. That's weird to say. I just admired him so much. So much like me; yet so chilled, so... normal, maybe? But someone who shared my interests and hobbies. We ran private servers together, I could show off my newfound HTML skills. So much to do; so little time.\n\nThen one day everything changed. I remember that it was so sudden. How did it go again...? Oh yeah. I got home from school as normal. I knocked for you but you had your 'girlfriend' round. You had gotten yourself a girlfriend. Then bam. All of a sudden you are the most social, outgoing person I know. No time for me. I can see it now - they all saw me as just a stupid little kid. They all matured faster than me. I must have been such an annoying little fucker, and yet I admired them so much. But yeah. Girlfriends, partying, I BET YOU HAD A GREAT LIFE. Room to yourself, an older brother to look up to who didn't treat you like shit, your own room so you could do what you wanted when you wanted... a house. Living near your  school. God what I would give to have your life.\n\nLet's retrace what happened:\n\n* My father is a drug-user who is abusive towards my mother as well as cold, distant and intimidating towards me. I remember I never cared much about anything when I was younger but if there was one thing that could get me emotional it was having to go to dad's for the weekend. His other kids hated me. I don't blame them. I was weird and quiet.\n* My neighbour and only friend who I knew that lived near me and who I felt I could relate to just a little bit grows up and leaves me behind. He gets a girlfriend and starts going to parties. Hanging out all the time at other people's houses. What did I expect? He's 2 years older than me...\n* A series of step-dads (not officially but you get my point) who don't seem to care about me. They're weird and cold. Once again, I guess I don't blame them. I was weird and quiet. I kept to myself. Why couldn't I have just been normal?\n* We move from my lovely house to a flat 10 miles away.

I can't relate to my brother. He's completely different from me and he hates me. He's so distant. It's the same with my step-dad. He's nice but I don't feel comfortable around him. It's not him, it's me. I just wish I had a real dad... I'm so selfish for saying that but I can't help the way that I feel.\n* My only other friend outside of school aside from my neighbour starts to grow apart from me. He takes different interests. He gets more into sports and less into computers. I can tell that I bore him. We grow apart. He doesn't care about me. I'm meaningless to him. I can tell.\n* The internet, what was once an infinite source of discovery and enjoyment and wonder, is now drab and uninteresting. Dull. I don't find it fun anymore. It used to be my reason to live, getting on the internet, and I mean that wholeheartedly. It used to be my reason to live; the reason I got up in the morning, and the only thing I looked forward to when getting home. It used to excite me and was fun as hell. I don't ever remember being bored whilst on the internet. Now I am bored. I don't take interest or pleasure. Even clicking links seems like a chore.\n* Masturbating, sleeping and indulging in caffeine-based products were among my coping mechanisms for the loneliness and unsociability. Now I take no enjoyment from any of it. It doesn't help me at all.\n* I feel disconnected and alienated from all of my school friends, all of whom are &gt;400,000% more sociable and normal than me. I don't exist to any of them outside of school. They don't care about me. They probably think I'm weird. No girlfriend. All the while my \"golden years\" are slowly passing by.\n\nPretty soon my childhood will be gone, and I can tell you, it has not been a good one. It's been shit. Lonely; miserable, fucking pathetic.

I live inside my head and my life is just uncertainty. Doubts abot everything and everyone, including myself. I feel hollow, numb, empty yet strangely kind of alive. I think it&amp;#39;s sadness. I only feel it in my stomach though, I don&amp;#39;t know, it feels like an abnormal sadness. It&amp;#39;s not in the pit of my stomach; but slightly there, lingering and pulsating like a little ember. It&amp;#39;s not in my face. My face feels flat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m lonely, really quite lonely, and bored. Very bored. I feel &amp;#39;dead&amp;#39;. I&amp;#39;m afraid to watch the time go away; I mean, after all, these are supposed to be the best years of my life. I&amp;#39;m 16, and I&amp;#39;m never going to be 16 again, you know? I can&amp;#39;t just sleep it all away. But... being awake is just some twisted, passive, torment. I don&amp;#39;t enjoy &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. The part of the day I look forward to most is drinking coke, for the caffeine. But even that&amp;#39;s starting to lose its enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could probably get out of this quite easily you know. Phone some friends. Get some bus money from my mum. Go meet them. Hang out, feel better. But it&amp;#39;s ironic; I just can&amp;#39;t seem to find the energy, or the motivation. So much effort. I&amp;#39;m so conscious all the time. I feel so disconnected and alienated from EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING. What is wrong with me? What is wrong with me? What is wrong with me? I just want to be fucking normal but I&amp;#39;m cursed... somehow. I doubt my &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; even care about me half as much as I care about them. I don&amp;#39;t even exist to anyone outside of school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to hide away online, you know? That was my thing... when I was younger, I was not social at all. Abusive father may have had something to do with that, I don&amp;#39;t know; maybe I&amp;#39;m reaching. Kind of wish I had a normal father though. Someone to be there for me as I was growing up. More than just my mother. I don&amp;#39;t want to take it out on her but... g&amp;#39;ah... it was just not enough to only have her. Or that&amp;#39;s what I feel like. Goddamnit. I never get sad anymore but the one thing that never ceases to make me tear up is when I ask the question, &amp;#39;Why, dad? Why did you have to hit mum? Why did you have to be so violent? Why couldn&amp;#39;t you just have been NORMAL AND LOVING AND UNDERSTANDING AND ATTENTIVE&amp;quot;? I was so fucking scared of you growing up... the first time I saw you after you moved out... I was shocked. I was so shocked. I told you I love you, but I&amp;#39;m still not sure to this day if I ever meant that. You put me on the spot a bit. You always told us you loved us, FUCK YOU. If you loved me then... I look on TV all the time and I see normal, happy families. Loving parents. I feel like you stole my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can never feel comfortable with my step-dad. Everything is shit. Anyway... I used to hide away online. I&amp;#39;d go home, get on my laptop, and just waste away those hours. When I was young and ambitious and full of energy, anything seemed possible. Hours, hours, hours, HOURS UPON HOURS of me just LEARNING, and discovering new content... and my neighbour was there for me. :C He&amp;#39;s gone now. Why did everything disappear so quickly? I loved my neighbour. That&amp;#39;s weird to say. I just admired him so much. So much like me; yet so chilled, so... normal, maybe? But someone who shared my interests and hobbies. We ran private servers together, I could show off my newfound HTML skills. So much to do; so little time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then one day everything changed. I remember that it was so sudden. How did it go again...? Oh yeah. I got home from school as normal. I knocked for you but you had your &amp;#39;girlfriend&amp;#39; round. You had gotten yourself a girlfriend. Then bam. All of a sudden you are the most social, outgoing person I know. No time for me. I can see it now - they all saw me as just a stupid little kid. They all matured faster than me. I must have been such an annoying little fucker, and yet I admired them so much. But yeah. Girlfriends, partying, I BET YOU HAD A GREAT LIFE. Room to yourself, an older brother to look up to who didn&amp;#39;t treat you like shit, your own room so you could do what you wanted when you wanted... a house. Living near your  school. God what I would give to have your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s retrace what happened:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My father is a drug-user who is abusive towards my mother as well as cold, distant and intimidating towards me. I remember I never cared much about anything when I was younger but if there was one thing that could get me emotional it was having to go to dad&amp;#39;s for the weekend. His other kids hated me. I don&amp;#39;t blame them. I was weird and quiet.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My neighbour and only friend who I knew that lived near me and who I felt I could relate to just a little bit grows up and leaves me behind. He gets a girlfriend and starts going to parties. Hanging out all the time at other people&amp;#39;s houses. What did I expect? He&amp;#39;s 2 years older than me...&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A series of step-dads (not officially but you get my point) who don&amp;#39;t seem to care about me. They&amp;#39;re weird and cold. Once again, I guess I don&amp;#39;t blame them. I was weird and quiet. I kept to myself. Why couldn&amp;#39;t I have just been normal?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We move from my lovely house to a flat 10 miles away. I now don&amp;#39;t get to see my neighbour (once I matured a little bit, we managed to salvage a bit of a relationship still, and I loved seeing him), I&amp;#39;m not in walking distance of my school and friends (back then this didn&amp;#39;t bother me; I didn&amp;#39;t have friends, but now I&amp;#39;m a lot more sociable and school and it could&amp;#39;ve meant I could see people without having to travel ages), it&amp;#39;s a lot more cramped and I hate it here.

Since I was 20, my knee has locked. Not incredibly often, but maybe once a year it will lock badly and I'll have to massage the kneecap until I feel something sort of \"thunk\" back and then I can move it again. It feels very sore and \"weak\" afterwards, and for a few days afterwards, if I bend it while moving it can slip back into a lock or \"twang\" unpleasantly.\n\nIt has also happened less frequently to my other knee, maybe only once or twice though.\n\nAnyway, now I'm 25 and recently my knee has been acting up more than usual. For instance, if I stand up straight and then bend over as if to pick something up, I can feel the bit that sometimes \"locks\" sort of tensing up and being painful. I am in a seated position now and I just leaned forward to pick something up and it twanged again. It's a horrible sharp feeling.\n\nhttp://www.200.com/images/knee-diagram2.gif\n\nIt feels like it's happening in the place where this diagram is marked \"Main Knee Joint\". That's also where it feels like it is locking up when it does lock, although massaging the kneecap seems to be how I unlock it. Urgh!

What did you study in school? Did your studies prepare you for direct entrance to a career in the field, for example, you studied engineering and are now an engineer, or you studied CS and are now a software developer? If the career path was not so obvious (ie you majored in Women's Studies and are now a database administrator), then how did you get into your current industry?\n* What sort of personal connections did you use to get your job, if any? Did your parents or professors know someone who was able to hook you up or at least vouch for you? Did you network at industry events and conferences as an undergrad and make connections there? Are you just in a field with very high demand? Did you sell your soul to the devil for a spot on the Washington Senators baseball team during their best season ever?\n* How much do you make? What percentage of your income goes to living expenses/debt/etc?\n* What's your approximate location? I ask this because cost of living varies so widely from location to location - 75k/year in Silicon Valley isn't as cushy a salary as 75k/year in St Louis.

I asked because I&amp;#39;d like to switch out of my current industry (publishing, but in a quantitative role) sometime in the next 2-3 years, probably by training for another field, or perhaps by deepening my education in my current field. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit:&lt;/strong&gt; SURVEY SAYS: You&amp;#39;re all main&amp;#39; mad bank as software &amp;amp; petroleum engineers. A few of you have advised to &amp;quot;do what you love and the wealth will follow,&amp;quot; but professional moped racing stopped being a career after the 1980s. Back to the drawing board. Thanks for all the responses! There&amp;#39;s a selection bias based on who was included in the sample, but I&amp;#39;ve read lots of interesting responses nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1333310464,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

Have been single for less than a month since age of 16. Have had a bunch of soul destroying past relationships and dealt with awful virus. Finally found current boyfriend who treats me well, then after 1.5 yrs met new guy who is amazing. Need to be single and learn to love myself but desperately want to be with new guy. What do?**\n\nThis is quite a long story, and just the though of typing it out makes me feel exhausted, but I will try to be concise. I feel like my situation is very complicated, and my past has led me to where I am today. I know that a lot of this isn't directly relevant, but I feel it's necessary to give an overview of my life. It's probably easiest if I start from the beginning. For reference I am 20 years old, female, and in my 4th year of university.\n\nAs a kid I was always pretty jealous. Whenever I spent time with multiple friends at once I'd end up feeling left out and I think because of this I mainly developed one-on-one friendships rather than having a group of friends. Most of my friendships from primary school ended with my friends ditching me/ignoring me/deciding they no longer wanted to be friends. I also mainly had silly crushes on older men (i.e. teachers) and never was interested in boys my age (nor did I get much attention from them).\n\nWhen I moved to high school most of these themes continued. I went to an all girls high school, so got zero attention from boys/men and had no male friends. I continued having mainly intense friendships with no larger group of friends. When I was 13-14 I was very close to a girl for about a year. It ended with her trying to destroy my life for no apparent reason (turns out she was very unhinged). She moved away after this. Around that time is when I began to struggle with depression - I couldn't understand why she had suddenly decided she hated me, and I missed her terribly. There was no one else in my year level that I felt I could connect with and I began to feel really alone.\n\nAt 15 I contracted a terrible virus - the main symptom of which was chronic fatigue. Initially I did not know what was wrong, and my depression worsened. I felt no motivation to do anything and could barely get out of bed and go to school. I had no explanation for this so naturally I blamed myself. I felt pathetic lying to my parents telling them I couldn't go to school because I felt sick, when really I felt healthy, just unable to face getting out of bed. Around this time I also got into a relationship with a 20 year old man. I had a girly crush on him, and just wanted someone to hold me and care about me. He was only interested in sex. I had no interest in sex at all, but it happened anyway (and it was awful). The relationship ended after three months when I found out he had spent the whole time in a relationship with another girl that he ended up choosing over me.\n\nThe period of time after this is kind of hazy for me. I was shattered, and began struggling even more to face getting out of bed in the morning. My illness was not diagnosed for another three months, and in the meantime I blamed myself for everything. \n\nAt 16, I finally knew why I was sick, but that didn't help the fact that getting through the day was a struggle and I was still heartbroken over the ex, and still had no friends. I fell for one of my (married, about 40 yrs old) teachers. He was compassionate about my illness, while most of my teachers treated me as if I was just being lazy. He seemed to want to listen to my problems. I guess it was obvious that I had a massive crush on him, and we got into a relationship.\n\nOnce again I had little interest in sex, I just wanted someone (a man) to CARE about me and look after me. But sex happened. He did care about me, and he tried to be a supportive figure but he was completely lost. He didn't know how to help and if anything he made things worse. He was always distant and we hardly ever had time alone together. He was juggling a wife and two kids along with me. This just left me feeling even more alone. I missed him desperately so much of the time. I'm pretty sure he believed that he really loved me, and to this day does not see how wrong it was to start a relationship with me.\n\nThe relationship with [teacher] continued for 2.5 years, half way into my second year of university. I was dependent on him and felt like I had finally found a man to love me. My illness began to go away and I tried to be content with seeing him so rarely, but I still felt depressed and alone so much of the time. I tried to focus on my studies, and although my grades were exceptional I had very little else going for me. I had not made any friends at university and although I was trying to heal my depression and be content, I couldn't.\n\nThe relationship ended when I was 18 because I cheated on him. I slept with a friend of my brother's (M, 20), who had had his eye on me for some time. He knew I was vulnerable, and took advantage of that. More than anything I was desperate for affection. I still felt I loved [teacher] dearly, but I knew that I had to leave because I could never forgive myself for cheating. I had sort of hoped that [brother's friend] would want a relationship with me - we actually related well to each other - but he made it clear that he wanted nothing other than sex.\n\nSo there I was again. Alone, and still hung up on [brother's friend] and in love and guilt ridden because of [teacher]. I was a mess for a month, and then I met my current boyfriend (21 at the time). And it was good. Finally someone loved me for who I was and was able to BE THERE for me when I needed it. Finally I had unconditional love and affection. Finally someone was respectful of my sexuality (or lack thereof) and willing to work through it with me (to this day I have very little desire for sex, it isn't unpleasant and it's something I'm happy to do for a partner, but I wouldn't be too phased if I were told I could never have sex again).\n\n[Current boyfriend] became my best friend. He wasn't perfect - we don't see eye to eye on religion/politics, and he has no motivation (while I am a very motivated individual) - but he was there. And suddenly a hole was filled. I'd been searching for someone like this my whole life, and finally I didn't have to worry about it any more. I didn't have to spend time feeling so alone. I could think about other things.\n\nI should note at this point that it would be wrong to say I had NO friends from the age of 15 onwards. There were two girls I talked to occasionally throughout all this, and they are still my friends today, but they had lots of other friends and we were never really close.\n\nSo this brings me to (pretty much) the present. I'm 20 and my boyfriend is 23, and we've been together 1.5 years. We spend most of our free time together, but we do have other friends (him more-so than me). We are open, honest, and deal with conflict well (calm discussion rather than arguments). I have insecurities left over from my past (mainly jealousy about other girls) but I try to be rational and explain my insecurities to him rather than getting angry. I recently (about 4 months ago) saw a psychiatrist and talked to him about most of my life story, he seemed to think I didn't have any major psychological issues and had ultimately dealt with things pretty well.\n\nWhich brings me to 5 weeks ago. I met a guy (22) at university and we really hit it off. [New guy] is really intelligent, motivated and adventurous (all things my boyfriend seems to be lacking in). We see eye to eye on things where my boyfriend and I do not. He thinks like me (analytic, critical thinker) and it is a pleasure to be able to talk to someone that actually has opinions on things (there seems to be a consensus that my boyfriend is very difficult to talk to, he gives a lot of one word answers, etc). My boyfriend is a high-school drop out while this guy is very hard working and has so much more passion for life. He makes me feel motivated to actually improve myself.\n\nThis leads me to one obvious conclusion - my boyfriend and I aren't entirely compatible. If I stay with him I will struggle to remain faithful every time I meet a motivated and highly intelligent man. This absolutely freaked me out. I have been basing my sanity off the fact that my boyfriend is here for me a loves me desperately, but I can't stay. It wouldn't be fair to him. We've discussed most of this - that I feel that he lacks some things I really need in a partner (MOTIVATION), and he agrees that he can't change himself and I need to come to my own conclusion. I've decided to leave.\n\nNow! Where I'm struggling is that I think it would be wrong to move on to [new guy]. I've been single for a total of 1 month since I was 16. I'm needy and inclined to rely on one person for everything. I'm jealous. I'm depressed and anxious. I need to find myself. I've spent my whole life trying to fill some hole, relying on other people for validation. I know I'm an attractive, intelligent and caring person (if a little messed up), but I can't seem to believe it. I have very little self confidence. I don't know what my passions are. I struggle to make new friends because I'm not interested in the things most other people seem to be interested in (sport, fashion, blah, blah, pop culture basically). I enjoy deeper conversations about politics, science, philosophy, religion, human psychology, etc.\n\nI desperately want to fix this. I want to connect with people, I want to get out, try new things, find my passions and learn to love life. I even have a pretty good idea how to go about these things. It's just that I'm falling desperately in love with [new guy] (we've talked about it, he feels the same way about me). I want to be with him but I don't think I can find myself while I'm in a relationship with someone else. More than anything I just feel so disappointed that I've met someone I'm so compatible with, that I have such a connection with, and that has made me realise that I'm finally strong enough to be alone and fix myself. So I want to know what you think - would I be making a massive mistake getting involved with [new guy] instead of letting go and finally becoming my own person?","domain":"self.relationship_advice","num_comments":6,"likes":null,"clicked":false,"thumbnail":"default","saved":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r0cn","ups":2,"approved_by":null,"score":1,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: me - 20, f.

I've been thinking about confiding in you all for a while now. I'm on my phone typing this at the moment so please excuse typos. \n\nI really don't want to go on and on so I'm going to try to get to the gist as quickly as possible. I'm 25 years old, 5'7\" and I think I'm 160 lbs. I'm a singke mom to a 6 year old. (I don't own a working scale. When I went to the dr about a month ago this is what I weighed.) Before having my son I was 140 lb. at one point at 135. I felt and looked great. After having my son I've lingered between 150 and 155. Ive been stuck at 155 for a year or two. I'm a full time college student working on a double major and I intern with kindergarteners. I want to be healthy and fit. I will be! I was working out much more and generally being healthier and happier from August to December of 2011. I hadn't been calorie counting or anything super strict as I literally am so freaking busy, that the first step for me was just making the effort and commitment mentally to change my life and health. Oh and in January of 2010 I quit smoking cigarettes after having smoked heavily for 7 years. When I want something better for myself or my son, or I decide to work on something to better myself, I will do it. I might slip up, or get down once in a while, but once I know in my heart what is best for me and my son, whether it be leaving his abusive father, getting full custody, adding my second major so I could become a teacher, learning how to not let my anxiety from school work get out Of control, quitting smoking, or building a better relationship with my father... I will do it. I just can't do it all at once. So in The fall of 2011 I was really beginning to work on my health a d exercise. I have known for about 2 years now that getting in shape and healthy was a serious priority for me. I Want to be around for my son as long as possible. \n\nSo on New Years Eve this year I fell in my high heels and broke my ankle in 3 different places. I've had surgery. I have 10 screws and 2 plates. I broke both my tibia and fibula. The tibia in two places. I guess I sort of broke my ankle and leg. The breaks were in like 3 diff places. It was a horrible break for just being in high heels and hopping off a railing I had been sitting on, not far up at all. I'm still in shock and every time my surgeon sees my X-rays he can't believe I broke it as badly as I did in that manner. Anywho, I had surgery Jan 5. I was bed ridden practically for 3 weeks. Then I started back at school on crutches. After id get home from school I'd rest in bed from swelling and pain. I got depressed from not being able to actively play with my son and not being able to drive anywhere. I don't have a lot of people to help out. It's been really hard. I'm in a walking boot now but I'm still not allowed to do even the elliptical. I won't be able to play tennis for a year. I began eating really healthy for about 2 weeks, but shipping for veggies and fruits for only 2 people, The food goes bad so fast! And I hate grocery shopping, especially injured! When I was on crutches cooking became so difficult and painful and took FORever. I am up at 5 am doing school work, at internship by 7:30, at therapy after that, picking up my son at 5:00 ish.  I have so little time to do some fun bonding with him, like playing at the park for an hour, cooking dinner, bath for him, and bed by 830. I usually fall asleep by 10:00. I'm so tired at the end of the day. \n\nI see how my muscles have deteriorated. I've gained 5-10 pounds in the past 3 months, probably more. All I've wanted to do the past couple if years, with regards to weight loss, is lose 10-20 pounds. Now I find myself unable to exercise for at least 2 more weeks (then I might be able to begin the elliptical), a bit depressed by my weight gain. I literally almost hate my body. I have awful stretch marks from pregnancy. But those along with this fat on my stomach and thighs and arms really gets me down. I can't afford new clothes. The clothes I've been wearing the past few years, in sizes I had to buy new, and bigger, are now too tight. I'm so uncomfortable. \n\nI realize my current weight at my height is a goal for many people. But for me, I'm uncomfortable. This isn't who I know I can be. I even had gotten down to 145 at some point post pregnancy. But I strayed from that. 5 pounds on me, gain or lose, makes a huge difference to me. My clothes fit totally different, I feel different, I look different. \n\nHow do I begin? Lately I've been just eating anything in front of me for comfort. I feel defeated. \n\nI want to be active so badly. I feel tired and overwhelmed. How do I begin to get ready for the time when the dr does say I can start light exercise? How do I find the time to shop for and cook healthy foods? The money? It's so expensive! I want to buy a scale (for food &amp; to weigh myself) and I tried calorie counting with my fitness pal but good lord I don't have time to sit there and input all the amounts of each ingredient.  I need suggestions for... Everything. Exercises I can do that don't involve weight baring on my leg? How to eat healthy and not too much without having to count and measure everything? If that's the only way to do it, then how do I make time for it when I already feel overwhelmed and that there's not enough time in the day?\n\nGah sorry this was so long. My mom just brought me a plate of Pancakes (I'm visiting her) right after I just told her Im desperate to get a grip on my eating. Wtf? Thanks mom. I turned them down but burst into tears. Now she's angry at me. Ugh. Life! You are a little bitch and awesome all at once. \n\nLove u all. Thanks for reading all this, if you did. You all are do inspiring to me. I'm glad I've found you. \n\nThat ended up being so long. I'm sorry.
