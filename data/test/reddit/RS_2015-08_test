Before last summer, I had been with a total of 5 girls. My last girlfriend and I were together for a few years, and she wanted to wait until marriage to have sex. After we broke up, I was in a huge funk, not knowing where I was in life. A few months passed and a few tinder dates with girls, and I had heard jokingly about this app called Grindr. At first I was tentative - I had experimented with my prostate alone before, but never really went further than a plug. After a few conversations, I met up with this guy at his house. I am 6'4\", and he was maybe 5'2\". We began slowly, just making out. I found that he was a bit aggressive, so I took his hand and put it on my crotch. I was just wearing some gym shorts, so he could tell that I was hard as a rock. He slid me to the edge of his bed and got on his knees. After stroking me for a while, he started using his mouth on me. To this day it's the best blowjob I've ever had. Men just know what men want! Finally, he asked me if I wanted to fuck him. Ultimately, all I wanted was for him to do me, but he said he was only a \"bottom.\" So I slid a condom on and he lubed his hole and my shaft up. First, he was on top - this position really did nothing for me but I loved stroking him while he was there. After a minute of that, I took him from behind. It was pretty hot that he was so tiny as I absolutely dominated him. To finish off, he was on his back and I stroked him while we both found our climax. After I cleaned up using some baby wipes, I left and I have never talked to him since. One of the hotter experiences for sure, but I definitely want to bottom.

My name's Michael, I'm 20 years old and from Denmark, so english is like my \"b-language\", if you understand. \n\nI work in a bakery, called Lagkagehuset (see the first image). Lagkagehuset is danish for \"cake-house\", with specialities in pastries, confectionaries, sandwiches, coffees and ryebread. \n\nWhy am I doing this post? Well. I work in Copenhagen, at the main shopping street, and in this summer-period, there's, obviously, a lot of tourist. Today I had this american teenage-guy, who was stunned by our selection. I told him I had considered this post for a while, but didn't knew if i should do it, but he convinced me that i \"should  absolutely do it, so the americans would drool\". I was like: \"Oh well. Lets try.\" \n\nLagkagehuset is extremely exclusive. One piece of pastry is about 5$. A large cup of regular black coffee is about 7$, and our confectionaries is starting from 6$. \n\nThe cakes/food is, no fucking kidding you, amazing. I'm not saying this because I work at the company, but im dead serious - there's nothing which tastes bad. \n\nAlso, we're three guys, and 27 girls, and i swear to god (look at the leo dicaprio pic).... My colleagues are smoking hot. I swear, I can't only point fingers at 2 girls, and that's it. I won't post pictures of them, but I tell you. Even my boss (which is 23 btw) is smoking, aswell. \n\nI'm gonna let the images speak for itselfs, but I think you should know about the \"big chocolate cake\". It's glutenfree, and made of chocolate, on french chocomousse, on chocolate, with chocolate at the top. Seriously guys. I wish I could send you a piece. \n\nSend me your questions, if you're curious. \n\nPeace out, \nMichael.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/AkO26if,qxctlKE,YG4WPqF,slESGWn,lFrU6Wd,z3tHXeI","id":"3fcrzd","archived":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_3fcrzd","saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":2,"is_self":true,"author":"msoeberg","from":null,"post_hint":"self","stickied":false,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3fcrzd/i_have_the_best_job_ever_and_youll_agree_after/","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhnd","from_kind":null,"created":1438391118,"from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":0}

My parents were not religious, we never prayed, went to church, etc.  And by highschool, I identified as an atheist, through and through.  (I'm 31 now).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA couple years ago, my marriage split up and I moved to a different state where my absolute BEST friend lives.  She and her entire family are Mormon.  Very...VERY Mormon.  She always knew my view on religion, and I knew hers, and we just never talked about it really.  It wasn't something we avoided at all costs, and if it was relevant to whatever we were talking about, it would be in there, but we never debated it I guess.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo during my time living there (about a year), I was getting really lonely and was trying to find myself.  I was intrigued by her, because she and her husband, while seemingly very much Mormon, were different.  They were very kind, they hardly ever even mentioned religion around me, they helped me more than I can explain to you (with my life, marriage, bipolar, etc etc).  I'm covered in tattoos, piercings (though I don't wear most of them anymore), I love shorts and strappy tank tops, horror movies...on and on.  But they never, not once, have made me feel judged.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo as I mentioned, I was lonely and intrigued.  I started talking to my friend about her religion, honestly hoping to be convinced.  I was in college as a science major, I've never been religious, I know it's all bull, but I was really hoping she could somehow change my mind.  (I was in a weird place.)  But....whenever I would try to talk to her about it (always over a chat program, never in person), it seemed like she would try and give me the shortest, most vague, quick answers she could and try to steer the conversation away.  Once she offered to contact some missionaries for me (in a very offhand way), but I declined as I have social anxiety and I really just wanted to talk to her.  Sometimes I got the feeling I was bothering her.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCan any of you shed some light on her behavior for me?  I've always been very confused by it.  I would assume if somebody showed an interest in the church, a member would absolutely be all over them.  But she gave me the feeling she really didn't want to talk about it.  Was it because I wasn't worth the investment, seeing as I've led such a life of \"sin\" already or something?  Or does that seem like somebody who may be doubting the church?  (She's never given me any inkling that she has any doubts, though).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThanks for any insight guys!","retrieved_on":1440576381,"ups":10,"permalink":"/r/exmormon/comments/3fcsht/confused_by_mormon_friends_lack_of_response_to_my/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","title":"Confused by Mormon friend's (lack of) response to my interest in the church.","secure_media_embed":{},"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"exmormon","created_utc":"1438387776","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.exmormon","hide_score":false}

Plus, walking around the city all day... let's just say the beautiful women have definitely caught my eye.\n\nI love dirty talk. I'm not sure if I'm up for a RP. Possibly if it's the right story. But I love talking about what each other prefers and then helping each other get off. There's nothing better than some light teasing, edging, biting, scratching, and dirty talk.\n\nGive me a message! I'd love to talk for the night :)","permalink":"/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3fct74/23_m4f_first_time_posting_introduce_me/","link_flair_text":null,"title":"23 M4F - First time posting.

Mine lasted two weeks in a reception class which I loved, kids were amazing and well behaved same can be said about the staff. After the two weeks I was pretty much sold. During my A-Levels I had a little doubt of putting myself in so much debt on a two week experience so my teacher suggested Teaching Assistant as all primary schools have them. Perfect! Best part is I got to go back to the same school I did my work experience in and see how much my class had grown.\n\nNow I'm 19 and a qualified Teaching Assistant going on to my second year.

Our duties were to stand outside job centres and ask people if they'd had any injuries in the hope they may be able to bring up a claim through us. They'd even ask us to ask them to fake whiplash and shit sometimes.\n\nBasically, I'm 19, recently moved into my own place and I left because I wasn't getting paid and the guy and his wife were really very rude to me and everyone else. We'd ask everyone, not get any claims and we'd get into shit for that. He owes me \u00a3308 and that might seem like a trivial amount but if I don't get that I can't pay my rent and I'd most probably get kicked out. I don't have money for basic sustenance, my phone bill, or any of my other bills.\n\nI've tried to contact him OVER AND OVER AGAIN with no results whatsoever. He kept saying he'd pay me but he's not. I'd last got in touch with him on my sister's phone (he'd blocked mine and my mum's number on his phone and on his WhatsApp and now my stepdad's as well). He said not to worry and that he'd pay me, and still I see nothing. I literally have 28 pence in my bank.\nThis guy is really sleazy and I did not think that this would happen despite prior warnings from previous employees, but he's just not doing anything to pay me. There are other 18-22 year olds who have the same problem with this guy. Seems he's almost preying on younger people. Small claims court will take several months. \n\nThe employment tribunal will take at least two weeks. I'm not disregarding these options but I dunno.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nI also posted this on another subreddit btw and one guy said to sue. I'm totally down for suing.

I was away a lot and unable to see her much for various reasons, and now, as summer ends, she has been making odd claims, and, if my and my family and friend's suspicions are true, trying to provoke jealousy from me.\n\nShe started by saying that while I have said I really wanted to see her, I never was able to go somewhere with her for the most part. This was because of my plans. I apologized anyways, but she reacted cynically, saying, \"about time you realized that\" then left. She was such a nice gal before we became a couple, yet now she complains at everything I say or do.\n\nAnd yesterday, she sent me a few texts, about how some junior boys, (we are gonna be freshmen this year) were hitting on her. This may very well be true, teen boys like me can be flirtatious, but why go out of her way to say it to my face?\n\nThen today, while she was at band camp, some of her friends, as well as this blonde guy named Evan got on her Skype and video chatted with me. It was cool talking to them, but then she grabbed the phone and ended the chat. Immediately after I'm bombarded with questions about what I saw and heard, especially about this Evan kid.\n\nSo after weeks of this, she says we need to meet at the park on Sunday to 'talk' and she won't say more. At this point I'm done. I think this is a lot of stress for me, I'm fourteen and she is my first girlfriend. Things were so much better before we dated, but she asked me and I said yes, thinking that she was great, but it seems she can't handle relationships responsibly, trying to get me ashamed and jealous as it feels.\n\nSo I have two questions: one, how should I tell her the relationship needs to end? I want to go back to being friends, and two, do you guys think I'm right in my suspicions, or am I being paranoid?\n\nEDIT: Just saying I'm pretty dumb with this title.

But come the end she approaches me and tells me she's met someone else.  I smile like I always do and pretend everything is fine, and we talk with some of the other women.  As one of them walks away, this girl tells me to keep trying, and I say the one that just left is my \"second favourite\".  She says she's out of my league, and spends the rest of the night heavy petting with this guy.\n\nI spend the rest of the evening being ignored and isolated, or just talking to women who say outright that they have no interest in me, just so I'm not the one not talking to anyone.\n\nI think I had it right when I wasn't trying, when I was just at a level amount of misery.  The more effort I put in the worse I feel now.  I can't bear the loneliness, or the effort of pretending I'm okay and something great will happen next time. \n\nI don't know how I'm going to get up tomorrow, I just can't find a way to be happy, or even like everyone else who can go out and kiss whenever.  I don't think there' anything left to try or reason to think I can make things change.","media":null,"ups":4,"retrieved_on":1440576341,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/dating/comments/3fcvjd/i_just_feel_more_and_more_alone/","downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"I just feel more and more alone","secure_media_embed":{},"created_utc":"1438389444","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"dating","domain":"self.dating","hide_score":false}

At the time the doctors just called it fibromyalgia and gave him the medicine and shots necessary. Over the years it progressed and got worse, leading to him losing jobs due to doctors appointments and hospital visits. Because of his work ethic he was always able to get a new job within a week and do any work necessary.  This was a rough life on my entire family but it was manageable. Up until about six months ago. His health went from steadily declining to completely launching itself off of a cliff.\n\nIn the past several months, he has gone from working 10 hour shifts every day that he wasn't in the hospital to unable to get out of bed. His feet,hands, and tongue all swell up to twice their regular size and he retains about three times as much water as a normal person. The proudest and strongest man I've ever known has to use a wheelchair at the age of 45. That's no way for anyone to live, but life's unfair and there's ways to combat whatever it is making him sick. \n\nThe only problem is that we don't know what's making him sick. Cancer's been thrown around a lot, amyloidosis is up there somewhere, a rare bone marrow disease, kidney disease, or something completely different; the point is that nobody knows. With the process of disability (which has begun!) taking as long as it does, he has no way of paying his insurance, medical bills, or even staying off the street. He lives in an uninsulated garage at the moment and can't afford to get anywhere else. I have a kid on the way with my wife and we both just graduated college so we have no financial power to lend.\n\nI just want my dad to live to see his grandchild grow up. I'm 22 years old and still a kid myself; I'm not ready to lose my dad yet. I can't do it. Spread the word, donate, tell me it will all be okay. Whatever you can do to help is greatly appreciated.

While looking for the \"right\" one, I came across [this box set](http://traemitchell.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/RowlingCoverReveal5.jpg) (that's just a photo, no affiliate link). I immediately fell in love with the look of it, and thanks to my poor self control I had an order placed within 5 minutes. \n\nI'm glad I did that because once I received it I spent most of my day reading the first book, unable to put it down until I was done with it, and I've already pulled out the second one which I will start reading as soon as I'm done typing this post.\n\nIt made me feel like a kid again (I'm 27 for reference). The characters all have their own distinct voices and personalities, even though a lot of them don't speak much throughout the book. The world is very quickly but effectively set up, I felt as though I was exploring Hogwarts with the main characters while reading. I was worried that the writing might be a little too simple since this is a series targeted mainly to kids and young adults, but I was happy to discover that wasn't the case. It flows so well and it just felt like there was always just enough of everything. I never felt like a chapter was dragging out, or like I wasn't getting the answers to my questions. Speaking of which, I loved all the little clues hidden in plain sight throughout the book, like [Nicolas Flamel's name casually mentioned on Dumbledore's card in the beginning, or Hermione knocking over Professor Quirrell when she's running to stop Snape from trying to knock Harry off his broom](#s). \n\nI can already tell I'll be needing something to fill the void once I'm done with the series. \n\nI'd love to hear your opinions on it, whether you've read the books or not.

{"permalink":"/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/3fd0n3/would_you_have_this_conversation_with_family/","link_flair_text":null,"media":null,"selftext":"First, a little about me and my family history. I'm 40. I have two older sisters, also in their 40s. Parents are early 70s. My mother's health isn't great. She used to smoke, be very overweight, developed Type II diabetes, had a TIA (mini-stroke), and had heart surgery 2 years ago. She is no longer overweight. She will likely be on a lot of medication for the rest of her life. \n\nHer father, though never overweight, died of a heart attack. We think her mother (also overweight most of her life) was diabetic and died of some type of cancer (we weren't close to her). My mother is now older than both her parents were when they died. \n\nRecently, my aunt (mother's sister), who is actually less than 10 years older than my oldest sister, had a mini-stroke. This is after having a heart attack several years ago. She is also a diabetic.\n\nSo, there is a family history of diabetes and heart disease. \n\nBoth of my sisters are obese. Of course I don't know how much they weigh but I'd guess one is probably 230-250 lb and the other is close to 300. I'm really worried about them. I always have been. But as we get older, and they're not getting any smaller, I've started to think about the long-term consequences of their size, especially given our family history. \n\nIt's been on my mind because we just went to visit our aunt. She's in a rehab facility and will likely be there for a few more weeks. I hated going there because it smells like a hospital and is full of ailing people, and I felt so bad for my aunt because of course she wants to be better and go home. And later my sister was like, \"Oh, why did this happen?!\" And I'm like, \"Are you joking? You know her medical history, you know our family medical history. That's why it happened.\" \n\nI just get the impression, from things said here &amp; there, that my sisters are in denial that their weight will ever cause them any major health problems. And it makes me sad, and it makes me angry. I don't want them to suffer. I don't want to have to see them suffer. I don't want to have to visit them in the hospital or a rehab facility. I don't want to see them scared, awaiting some procedure or surgery due to a life-threatening condition.\n\nI want to say something to them, because we're not getting any younger! This is the time of our life when our bad habits and choices start to catch up with us. It doesn't get easier as we get older, shit just gets more and more fucked up.

We have done so much together already and I look forward to every moment we will spend together. Every issue we have ever had we have talked it out in a mature manner and have always expressed when we disagree with what the other is doing. I am 28, he is 30 and we are still trying to figure this life thing out.\n\nThat being said, of all the issues we have worked through there is one problem that we just can't seem to figure out... money. We always said we would never fight about money because we both feel there are more important things in life, like us, but that was easy to say when we had disposable income to throw around. We have still never fought about money but I feel like we are one step from the edge.\n\nI am in the middle of getting my degree in college so my funds have dropped about 30k a year. We moved to a place with higher rent because he was promised a job that would pay more, working with his friend. Although this job is a higher wage he works far less hours. This isn't less hours because they work fast, this is less hours because they are buddies and they do friend things together instead of working as much as they can. This is less hours because they got drunk the night before and are too hung over to wake up early enough to get a full day of work in. \n\nI am okay with all of this. He quit a job that he hated and gets to work with his friend and I support that fully, I want him to be happy. The issue I have is he has started the extremely expensive hobby of motorcycling. Oh my god is this ever expensive. Since he begun this we have barely been treading water.\n\nHe has taken pay day advance after pay day advance for the funds for this and I have had to in turn take out pay day advances to help pay for bills and food.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am definitely not great with money and I'll be honest... some of that pay day advance money was used for cathartic reasons but I feel like I wouldn't have to use a pay day advance for those reasons had we not thrown our money away on stupid things like more rent and a motorcycle and hangovers. To make things worse, as I'm trying to pay off the pay day advances he's getting larger ones to support his hobby spiraling us further into debt with no remorse or desire to get out. And without telling me he has decided to do this until after the fact.\n\nI have spoken to him about everything I am concerned about (hours,  moving, spending and the like) his reply is to either ignore my pleas or get mad and tell me im nagging. I have tried budgets and jars and expense trackers.  I have even tried taking his paycheck and giving him spending money for the week (with his permission). Nothing has worked. He stopped giving me his paycheck or he asks me for money, which I give him because it's his money and I'm not a bitch. I just thought maybe he would try and make an effort if he saw me doing it but I guess I was wrong.\n\nI'm at my wits end and I can't think of anything else to do except stop trying to help him and let him figure it out himself. I have decided I should just pay my half of the bills and get myself out of my own debt and he will hopefully see what a burden his spending has on us. The only drawback I can see is a bill not getting paid and if that is the case then he will have to pay the nsf. Or I can ask him for his half of the bills on his pay day. \n\nI am looking for opinions and possible alternatives to this. I feel like such a bitch but this is really all I can think of to do other than scream at him. Please help.\n\nTL;DR - Husband is over spending putting us in debt. I am thinking of not helping him anymore and pay only my half of the bills in the hopes he will see how hard being responsible is... am looking for alternative solutions.","retrieved_on":1440576257,"ups":5,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/3fd228/should_i_stop_supporting_my_spouse/","link_flair_text":"[new]","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Should I stop supporting my spouse?","subreddit":"relationships","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1438393064","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.relationships"}

I just click link after link, barely skimming through the articles. \n\nIs this a symptom of ADD? Do I need meds? \n\nI am so deep in this rut of responsibility avoidance that I'm watching every single fucking aspect of my life erode into chaos and failure. My business, my relationship, my friendships, my health, my finances. my goals...

Delete my account, block it from my browser and get my life back on track.\n\nI used to think facebook was bad but honestly, that stupid site is small potatoes compared to the sheer amount of nothing that I do on reddit.

It was on my birthday and no it wasn't a surprise party for me. It was kind of depressing I felt unnoticed. If I don't text or message my friends we won't talk.

I don't know who to go to but i need help with getting back into it.\n\nA little about me, I'm 21 and (was) a dedicated powerlifter. I have been lifting since 2012 on a body building routine and now converted to power lifting in 2013. In may, i went through the most traumatic and stressful events of my life thus far. I broke up with my first love, I had to stress about finals, and i have been waiting for months to see if i was admitted into one of the best universities in my state. I was extremely depressed. And at this time, i channeled everything into lifting weights. I hit awesome PR's in my deadlift, squat, and bench that got me into the 1200's club. I was so amazed and surprised. I also tried to put myself out there, so i started doing crossfit on my off days. I wanted to look good by leaning out and get stronger, but i soon paid a devastating price since both are tough to do at the same time. At this time, i was doing IIFYM, so i would eat whatever as long as i get in my macros. All the events happened in a 2 month period with no deloads.\n\nNow, just one day, i didn't eat enough after a class of crossfit, and i just \"burnt out\" the day after on a bench session. I would have some \"burnouts\" once or twice during my year or so of powerlifting, but i would get back into lifting about 2 months later. \nThe usual symptoms would be, fatigue, acheness, lack of motivation, trouble concentrating, and extreme sleepiness. I believed that it was something like i had before and just settled down for a couple weeks.\nBut weeks turned into months and i am very lost into what i should do. \n\nI've been going to gym to do light weights to slowely regain my lost strength, but i get light headed by squating an easy 135, and it has only been 4 months! when i am there, I don't want to be at the gym and this leads to me feeling worthless. My ass is flabby, my six pack is gone, my muffin tops have grown in size, my diet has gone to shit, and i just cant take it anymore,\n\nI was wondering if someone has experience something like this can help me. I don't know what you could call my symptoms, \"overtraining\"? \"adrenal fatigue\"? I don't care. I'd just want to start getting back into it and feeling good again, no matter what it takes.\n\nI apologize if the information is all out there and the sentences are worded incorrectly, if there is any information needed i have left out, please ask.","media":null,"ups":14,"retrieved_on":1440576242,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/Fitness/comments/3fd36n/4_month_burnout_needs_advice_and_help/","from":null,"author":"Cogito_ErgoSum","is_self":true,"num_comments":22,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_3fd36n","link_flair_css_class":null,"archived":false,"id":"3fd36n","score":14,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3fd36n/4_month_burnout_needs_advice_and_help/","secure_media":null,"created":1438397313,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhx4","from_kind":null,"stickied":false}

I'll make a doctors appointment when I return maybe, but I feel I'd just be prescribed pills regardless of my age. I'm 17 years old and I'm not quite sure but I think, maybe I have anxiety, ever so slightly. Last year, the whole of the summer I was a fair amount depressed after and during a rocky relationship which eventually ended, but all through my life and not just at that point I've had a fair amount of anxiety about loads of different things. I tend to fixate on things and can worry about them for hours and days on end and I know it won't help but I'll justify it in my head and believe that constantly thinking more will help. \n\nAnyways, I'll probably delete this soon because I'm not fond of having alot of details about me on here but I think I might have anxiety and I'm not sure what the next step to take would be and I'm apprehensive about seeing my doctor because he really would just prescribe me a pill and send me home. \n\nI stay up all night on my phone until my energy is completely drained, otherwise (if its night time) there's no chance or little chance of me getting to sleep. I think it's a way of escaping. I hear noises, not hallucinations but just noises that are already there, just like 100000x more exaggerated. A dripping toilet would be a hundred times louder at night or if I'm alone and I'd get tight chested maybe, depending on certain things. I tend to be wide awake and \"wired\" if you will alot of the time and can now go on about 4/5 hours sleep and go a whole day. I drink a fair amount of coffee which doesn't help but when I don't drink it it seems it's worse sometimes. I'm not very good at all at the moment at starting conversation or talking to people. I know alot of other people aren't either but I would get completely flustered depending the person and even if its someone who I feel comfortable talking to I sometimes speak way too fast or too low so they don't catch my drift. In spirit I'm a very mellow laid back person I'd like to think and enjoy listening to people but it feels like my fears and anxieties overtake me.\n\nIn short, from what I've said so far (and this isn't all of the stuff, I'm sure there's more but its almost 4am) am I just being a bit of a softy and trying to self diagnose with anxiety or, COULD there be a legitimate reason to believe I have anxiety? I cant look people in the eye. I never have been able to do that unless I know them. I can't speak up too loudly etc but I'll stop now since this is all scattered and jumbled.\n\n\nTLDR\n\nHaving what my friend mentioned to be \"panic attacks\" recently (tight chest and sense of dread) which I have never really thought anything of. Overall I do not sense dread constantly but in certain situations it's strong. Wondering if this could be bigger than I possibly think of it to be and if its affecting my health. Been like this for about a year with things sort of getting gradually worse.\n\n\nI would STRONGLY appreciate if you actually read all of this and would be surprised if you did, but moreso I would appreciate a first opinion from people who actually suffer before I get any opinion from my doctor (and I cannot at the moment as I am on vacation)\n\n\nI could honestly go on forever, but may delete some of this as its quite a handful.

I began reading and internalizing TRP material for about 6 months now, and have already noticed major improvements in my personal life. I am much more bold, confident and in control of my life than I ever was before. I started taking fighting lessons, eating healthy, going to the gym and generally taking care of myself. Although I feel like I have gotten very far in the last 6 months, I can see that this is only the first half-step of my journey to become the best I can be. Despite the fact that I feel like I've internalized most of the material I've read on both /r/theredpill/ and here, I have a lot more to learn. This is why I am requesting your feedback - any response is appreciated.\n\nBackstory - In high school, I was surrounded by a small population of 'bad kids' (drug addicts, kids with mental issues, etcetera). I didn't like them, so I stayed away from them, and as a result I was excluded from pretty much all social gatherings and had very little social interaction outside of my close circle of friends and a few geeks. On top of that, I was a very late bloomer and didn't hit puberty until I was well into the senior year (18 years old), so no girl found me attractive for obvious reasons (people say I still look like I'm 16). Because of that, during my high school years I basically had no intimate interaction with women whatsoever.\n\nTo this day I am still having trouble with initiating intimate contact with women - more specifically, going from meeting to seduction to casual sex. I think I am charming and fairly attractive, but I am so inexperienced in this department that I just don't know where to start. I don't have issues with meeting new women and going out, but that is not what I am looking for. I have considered going to bars and clubs, but I have never been there before, so I do not know what to do there or how to do it. I live with my father and will be for at least the next few years (I have decided to finish college and pay off my college debts before I move out and live a life on my own), so that might be a barrier, but I find that one of my college friends who always has a new girl every week is in a similar situation and is doing just fine. As well, I am entirely clueless about anything concerning 'sex etiquette' - considering I've never had any intimate contact, what should I be expecting, and what should I be aware of? \n\n\nWhat do you think is the best course of action for me in my situation if my goal is to start spinning plates? Could you recommend me any good readings/other resources regarding picking up women at clubs/bars and going from meeting to initiating intimate contact? Should I go full out and just talk to them or is there a technique I should learn first and take it slow?\n\nI appreciate any feedback you guys leave me - I am always striving to improve myself, and your response are very helpful.\nThank you.","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.asktrp","subreddit":"asktrp","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1438394956","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Requesting feedback on my current situation","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"stickied":false,"created":1438398556,"subreddit_id":"t5_2y2sm","from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/3fd5e9/requesting_feedback_on_my_current_situation/","from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":1438395543,"score":2,"archived":false,"id":"3fd5e9","gilded":0,"name":"t3_3fd5e9","link_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":4,"is_self":true,"author":"sXeLexi","from":null}

However, since this is my first time on birth control and honestly I have no idea what's going on, I'm really paranoid about it not working. So far I've had no side effects other than a better mood and nicer skin, I'm really not sure if it's affecting anything else. I'm about a week into my second packet of Lolo (lo loestrin fe) which apparently is a really low dose one which is kind of why I'm worried. I'm not sexually active right now, so I'm mostly wondering for future reference I guess. I'm around average height and build, 5'5\" and around 145lbs (I'm kind of chubby? I guess? lmao) and I'm worried that it's not enough hormone for me if that makes sense? I also started my first packet about halfway through my cycle and got a full period with about a week left of the packet. For this month's packet though, my period ending matched up much better with the beginning of the packet. After researching I know I should have started it after my period, but I *was* really happy about the immediate end of my mood swings and acne that the pill gave me so I guess it wasn't a complete screwup.\nAnyways, I feel like I won't be able to tell whether this pill is really working for me as a contraceptive? Do I have to wait to completely miss my periods to know whether or not it's working? I don't really want to switch though since this pill seems to be perfect for me in all other areas. I do have migraine headache with aura (thus I'm reluctant to go on higher doses but I'm willing to give it a shot, the headaches are managable as long as I stay away from my trigger foods), but I do have a doctors appointment soon so I could ask for a different prescription. I really don't know a lot about this so any replies or feedback would be really appreciated! Thanks so much!

Of course we can also swap pictures first.","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.RandomActsOfMuffDive","subreddit":"RandomActsOfMuffDive","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1438396900","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"24 [M4F] #NYC - Do you love getting eaten as much as I love eating?","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","downs":0}

I dont have a car or any other motor vehicle and this motorcycle will be my first vehicle. I checked with Progressive and Geico and they quoted 130 and 150 per month for new 2014 ninja 650. \n\nDo you think that is a lot or normal rate? How much do you guys pay? Any specific insurance provider that you guys advise?\n\nEDIT: I am 24 and from SF Bay Area, California\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks guys. I shopped around and found a deal for $750/pa. Comprehensive - $250, Collision - $250, 15/30/5. ","media":null}

I usually try to respond to posts rather than making my own but tonight I thought that I'd try my luck. This may not even be the best sub for what I'm looking for, but what the hell.\n\nSo here it goes, I'm a white man. I'm 6 foot tall, brown hair, blue eyes, and glasses. I'm also a bit overweight at 230lbs. Hopefully that doesn't scare too many of you away. I'm also an attorney.\n\nAnyway, I'm currently single and porn is great. But I really prefer talking to a real person. We can share our favorite kinks and porn clips or images or whatever. I love that.\n\nBut what really helps me get off in knowing who I'm talking to. At least having a single picture of the person. And it doesn't even have to be NSFW. Just a regular picture will do. But NSFW pics are more than welcome. Haha. And I'll of course be more than willing to send pics of myself as well.\n\nSo, if there is a brave woman out there who is willing to show me what she looks like, then that would be awesome. I'm not asking for knockouts, though i wouldn't turn you away. I'm just looking for anyone who wants to have fun.\n\nIt'd also be great if this could be a long term thing. But I understand if you're just looking for something quick and easy. I'm also available to chat via reddit, kik, skype, or whatever. And don't feel obligated to send a pic in the 1st message, it's totally ok to chat for a bit and see if we get along before exchanging pictures.\n\nI have a ton of kinks BDSM stuff and what not but can also chat about vanilla stuff.\n\nAnd... That's basically it. We can discuss things further in PM. Hope to hear from someone soon. :)","retrieved_on":1440576168,"ups":0,"permalink":"/r/exxxchange/comments/3fd8vy/27_m4f_the_hunt_continues/","link_flair_text":null}
