I'm 29 years old and have been dealing with anxiety and depression for most of my life and just been told I'm also bi polar lol. \n\nI always have this thick fog over my mind clouding thoughts and words and I'm barely able to complete sentences around people. \n\nOnly anti anxiety meds that really helped were benzos but I messed up and drank on them and no one wants to give me any. So I've been on many anti depressants and none really took away the anxiety. \n\nRecently last year I started using phenibut and quit my paxil and had amazing results of no anxiety nor depression. I guess I was in an manic state. Then it stopped working and everything fell apart. Its hard to function at all, i can make it to work and barely socialize. Im supposed to go to AA Meetings but can't think of what to say.\n\nShould note I've been on gabapentin for around 2 years now and I'm noticing sharp pains in my head if I don't take it right. Also my memory has gotten bad.. I feel trapped in this loop.. \n\nTried cbd oil no real results..\n\nI've tried L Theanine which it seems makes me feel nauseated. Bought some Alpha GPC and Aniracetam but haven't felt much. I've tried magnesium, had my thyroid levels checked.. I'm going nuts. A month ago my doctor put me on lithium and doxepin, but I'm having odd thoughts that come out of no where. \n\nI only took the lithium for a few days and started to feel weak and slow. The doxepin I keep starting then stopping because of constant racing thoughts.. Not sure what to do anymore! \n\nI'm thinking of coming off the gabapentin as I'm getting pains in my head and that may be the cause. Trying lithium out again may help, i don't see my doctor till the 20th..

This is my first post on this subreddit, and my first post ever, so sorry if I make any mistakes or something.  \n\n\nAs you can see from the title of this post, I am part of the LGBT+ community and I am also Muslim. I am 12 by the way, which makes it a lot harder. I know many of you will think that I am too young to be thinking about these issues but I have been having thoughts about who I am and what I am feeling since I was 10.  \n\n\nWhen I was 9, I went to Istanbul with my mother. My dad passed away when I was 4 and I don't have any siblings, but luckily my aunt came along to the hotel with us. Our last night there, we talked for an hour about my femininity, liking \"girly\" things, etc. She said I needed to grow out of liking these feminine things, and I agreed at the time. I was crying. I remember it vividly and she made me feel like I had a disease. I hated it, but I really thought that everything my mum said was true.  \n\n\nI came out 2 months ago, on the 31st of December, 2018, or atleast I tried to. My New Years resolution at the beginning of 2018 was to \"be honest\", I told my mother, which was coming out. I tried to many times before that but I couldn't bring myself to say the words. It still feels weird telling people in my school, but I will get to that later. Anyway, I simply came downstairs and was just going to say 'Anne (Turkish for Mum), I am gay.', I didn't want to make it seem like a big deal. I was pacing around the room for 20 minutes, repeatedly asking if she would love me no matter what, and then I finally said it. Her response was what I sort of expected.  \n\n\nShe laughed and said \"You are joking, right?\". Even though I knew it was likely she was going to say this, I was still taken aback. I hoped she would just accept me, so what else could I say but \"Yes.\" and laugh. She got angry at me for testing her. My fear was never anyone else not liking me for being gay, it was that the word would spread and my mum would hear.  \n\n\nAfter returning from winter break, I decided to come out to my friends. I tried to come out to my mum and she wouldn't listen so I didn't care if she heard it from someone else. I am now able to tell people I am gay, and everyone so far has been accepting, and I even told one of my teachers, who has been honestly such great support.  \n\n\nI know that my issue is very common but I am still so confused. I don't care about what the Quran says about gay people, I now know that I am not sick and I cannot change who I like. The thing I am confused about is that I know she knows I am gay, but I feel like she can't admit it to anyone else or herself. I often tell my mother how I like playing with my friends' (all girls) hair, and today she said \"So is that what you like in a woman?\" and I say \"No, I don't like anything in a woman.\". She said something along the lines of \"You must like something about women...\", and I could tell she was trying to reassure herself I wasn't gay.  \n\n\nI just don't want to upset my mother. No matter when I tell her, she will never be happy about it. I recall asking my mother several times about, saying that my friend had a gay friend and what would she do if she had a gay child and she said 2 things. \"You are too young to know.\" and \"You would still be my child.\". The first one didn't really affect me, but the second one did. Not because of what she said, but how she said it.

I don't care if she kicks me out of the house or sends me to a mosque, I just don't want her to blame herself or feel bad things.  \n\n\nThis post was kind of a rant of sorts, but also combined with a post asking for advice.

I'm 18, male, and my name is Noah. I've dealt with various mental issues for years now that had started to die down. But they started acting up again. I was severely sexually and mentally abused for years, starting when I was around 8 or 9. When I got taken out of the school where the abuse had taken place, I was stuck in a rocking position on my couch for about six months straight. No talking, no movement, no signs of mental cognitivity (if that's the word) besides eating and light grunts. Anyways, after 6 months of this I finally started to break out of my trance as if my mind had started to rebuild itself. I got sent to a small middle school around year 7 to try and rebuild my social skills, to no avail. I was changing who I was, what I liked, who I liked, basically a complete personality change every week or so. It was exhausting. I started to have these thoughts. Full of death, agony, and torture. They invaded my every thought. Every time I saw someone I would think of the most gruesome ways I could end their life. Every time I would enter a new room, I would see new items and get flooded with ways of killing my peers with said item. Soon the thoughts grew into urges, then the urges started to take over. I would come literally inches away from stabbing some kid with a pair of scissors many times. I told my parents about these thoughts and they said it was \"hormones\" and that I needed to pray them away. I graduated from middle school and my issues only got worse. I became extremely impulsive sexually, drug usage, and violence wise. I started lying about everything about me, telling various grand tales about my past and what I could do. I would manipulate people so easy, fabricating drama between people just to watch shit burn. I'd build up someones trust in me, then let it all fucking crash. I disassociate most of everyday, to the point that I go catatonic. I pretty much lose complete control over my entire body, eyes included, but I'm completely awake and aware that its happening. It feels like im just a ball of energy stuck in a hollow cave. Eventually my \"personality's\" morphed into the voices in my head. I have three; my neutral state, which reassures me that I'm mentally fine. My depressive one which tells me everything wrong with me and makes me harp on them. And the one that says hes a demon and fills my head with the violence. They take over a lot, but mainly just fight in my head. Sometimes both the depression and anger side breakout and have full conversations. My roommate has walked in before to them both talking at each other through my mouth, obviously freaking him out. In the past 2 years though, shit has take a turn for the worst, I started wanting to actually kill. Not just a slight want, but a need. I used to be scared of these thoughts and fight them, saying that its not me. But maybe it is me, maybe im supposed to kill. I started cutting myself, burning myself, spending nights alone in my dark room meditating on the violent thoughts and talking to myself. I have murder dreams all the time now. My roommate woke up to me asleep in my bed with my eyes open repeating \"I could do it. I could kill him right now.\"I also deal with sexual anhedonia and I have sadistic personality disorder, obviously making a killer cocktail.I'm highly considering institutionalizing myself again.\n\nTLDR; I'm a manic depressive, sadistic mess who will most likely go on a killing spree.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjdm","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Advice","subreddit_subscribers":268546,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Help","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/avy52m\/help\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n&gt;\n&gt;I am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u\/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt;But there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n&gt;\n&gt;I was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\n&gt;It all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n&gt;\n&gt;She had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt;I was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n&gt;\n&gt;She is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Edit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you.\n&gt;\n&gt;Edit 2: Honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. I promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. Thank you for the gold.Thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. I honestly have gone through as many as I can and I just feel really fortunate and grateful.\n&gt;\n&gt;I sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead.

I was probably around 15 (I'm 22 now) \n\nMy grandma had a pacemaker and had some complications. She was sent to this old veteran hospital and was confined for 8 days. \n\nThe hospital alone was already creepy. I always felt uneasy during the times I watched over my grandma.\n\nSo the hospital allows at least one family member to watch over their relatives and stay the night. Since my dad didn't really care much, (that's another story), I offered to watch over my grandma. She and I were pretty close. \n\nNow, I loved staying in my grandma's ward. It was lively. There were at least 15 people there but the ward was really really big. So while my grandma rested I made friends. Someone even brought a portable dvd player and we all watched a movie. \n\nWhat I hated about the hospital was the fact that it was like a labrynth. You can easily get lost, especially at night. \n\nAnyway, on day 3, I was still getting used to the hallways. My aunt stayed until evening and let me go around to buy myself some food. And since the place was like a maze, I got lost. The next thing I know, I ended up in the morgue. There was a guy there, probably the one in charge of the place. As I make my way out, there was this figure. It was a black shadowy figure. It was walking down the hall and out of curiosity, I followed. The figure went to a ward and disappeared. I stood in the hallway completely confused. Then after a few seconds some guy went out calling for a doctor shouting about how his dad was no longer breathing or something like that. I felt chills and I ran down the hall to go back to my grandma. Took me half an hour to find my grandma's ward. I never told anyone what I witnessed. I mean, it would be inappropriate. So I just kept my mouth shut. \n\nOn Day 6: \nMy aunt left me with enough snacks and some fruit for my grandma before going home for the night. I waited for my grandma to fall asleep before sleeping on my chair. As I mentioned, the ward was really huge and spacious. The windows were large so we didn't need any air-conditioning or fans because nights there were really cold. I always covered my grandma with two layers of blankets and I slept with a jacket on. \nIt was the same cold night and it was quiet. Everyone was asleep. The nurse woke me up a few times here and there for my grandma's hourly medication and by 2 am I was no longer sleepy. I was playing on my phone when the clock struck 3 and I felt a soft breeze on the bed behind me. \nI turned and saw the black figure again. I almost dropped my phone. \n\nThe old lady on the bed was sleeping and her son (or grandson idk) was sleeping soundly too. I looked away not wanting to see whatever was going to happen. \n\nBy 5 am, when the son woke up and the nurses are rounding for the paitents' meds, they found out that the old lady was already dead. \n\nAfter that I never saw the figure again. Maybe it moved to a different ward. I don't know. But I was glad that it didn't take my grandma at that time.

Anyway, I'm 20 at the time and i can see the day i have to move out from home. I need to sell all my old toys and stuff that are in the loft.\n\nI was big into lego when i was a kid and my parents bought me some really expensive lego technics sets - all together about \u00a3200 worth.

My friend who was with me darts around the table and holds his arms out to stop her. I rush around the other side and try and take the boxes off her.\n\nEM \"no. i paid you\" \n\nshe has them wrapped in her arms now and clutching them to her body. I'm not really sure how to tackle this and how to get them out of her arms.\n\nMe \"you haven't paid me, give me them back\".\n\nI manage to get a good hold on one and her grip loosens. \n\nEM \"i paid you. i paid you. i paid you\" she's shouting and actually stomping her feet. \n\nWe're causing quite a commotion and this guy who is set up next to us comes over. \n\nShe looks at him \"i paid for this and now he wont give them to me\"\n\nMe \"no you haven't. i'm not selling for \u00a32\"\n\nThe guys grabs her arms and she loosens her grip on both boxes and i take them from her.\n\nShe's shouting that she's going to get the stewards to kick us out and how dare we take her money. I go and put the boxes in the boot of my car and shut it. my mate is standing guard between her and our table. \n\nAnother guy who probably hasn't seen what has happened comes over and is looking over my stuff.\n\nEM \"he'll take your money but he wont give you the toys\"\n\nHe looks at her like 'what the F are you talking about. \n\nFortunately one of the stewards who collects the fees comes over. \n\nEM \"kick him out.

I had the best mother I could ever ask for, a good education that I was doing exceedingly well in, plenty of money, I got everything I asked for, I had some great friends, I lived in a good neighbourhood, everything was pretty much perfect.\n\nI'm now still technically in my younger years; I'm 17. I'm still well-off and at a good school. But I've lost all forms of support I feel comfortable with. Last year my mother was diagnosed with cancer. Doctors have tried every form of therapy, they're on their final treatment method now. I was told last week if it didn't work she'll be gone 3 months from now, and even if it does that'll be extended by a couple years at best. Having such an integral part of my life removed like that, I think you can imagine the impact that's had on me. I also feel like I'm becoming more distanced from my friends, as interests have changed so it's kind of like keeping a friendship going just for the sake of what it used to be.\n\nSo now with my mother pretty much bedridden, everything in my life now has to go through my father. And fucking hell what a father figure he is. I'm usually a very chill and understanding person, but I won't lie I've wanted to kill him on numerous occasions. He has been physically, mentally and emotionally abusive to me for years. I've had to have police called over at least twice because of what he's done to me. Just yesterday I had to call him to pick me up from school early because I had a terrible headache, I was completely overcome with pain and couldn't think straight. He asked me a question I couldn't answer because of the headache, and he slaps my fucking forehead which is already killing me and tells me I'm irritating, unhelpful and need to see a psychiatrist. I don't think he knows the meaning of hypocrisy. He's the most heartless being I know. He'll hit me for the slightest mistakes, even when it wasn't a mistake, constantly put me under unnecessary pressure or illusions of how I'm meant to act, and whenever I don't do exactly as he asks me to he'll make me feel like the worst person in the world, a complete failure that doesn't deserve all the fortune I've had so far. He has a completely delusional world view that he, and literally no one else, perceives as how it should be, and I take one step out of that line and everything goes to shit. It's complete bullshit most of the time too, I'm too frustrated at the moment to think of an example but if I followed every instruction of his I'd grow up a horrible person. But of course everything else in my life is fucked so this is what I have to deal with.\n\nOh yeah, to make my already brilliant situation even better, I'm in year 12, my final year of study. The year I get a number that will basically decide my life (so I've been convinced) and of course now all this shit happens. My parents expect me to get a score in the top percentile, and apparently anything else and I'm doomed. My guiding light in my mother is dying and unable to help me, my father is providing me absolutely no confidence and rather constantly putting me down and making me drown in self-doubt... \n\nWhy? Why must so much go wrong now in the most important year of my life? Why is the worst thing I know the only thing I have left? What did I do wrong? What am I really worth?

I have since I moved out for college at 18. I see my parents once about every other week, and spend the night about once a month while visiting home. I\u2019ve always been annoyed by the need to give daily phone calls home, but it hasn\u2019t really upset me too much until the past year or so. My first couple years of college, there were a couple times that I didn\u2019t call or answer because I had fallen asleep with my phone on silent, and when I finally woke and called me back, she answered sobbing and saying that she was getting ready to call the police. This was over me not answering for a few hours. This evolved over time into not only needed to call once daily, but needed to regularly \u201ccheck in\u201d by texting her when I made it home from school, home from being out with friends, and even more recently, calling her on my drive home from work, but her needing me to text her after I made it to my house. I am extremely over it, and not sure how to respond. I know that this is something I should have gotten control of years ago, but I didn\u2019t and I don\u2019t know how to step in now. I don\u2019t want to hurt her feelings, because like I said, I see them often and we are close, but it is driving me crazy. I literally cried today after getting off the phone with her because I\u2019m just so frustrated by it. How can I explain to her that I need my space, without hurting her feelings? She is also depressed, and I am her only child, so I guess I kind of feel responsible for doing what I can to make her happy. \n\nBackground: My parents were an interesting combination of over protective (their friends and siblings always have them shit for not letting me do anything\/sheltering me) and neglectful (allowed me to be in an abusive\/sexual relationship ages 13-18). They are both functioning alcoholics that had no problem holding down jobs but drink nightly.  All this being said, I have always been close to my parents. I\u2019m an only child, and spent much of my time growing up at home with them. We generally get along well.\n\nI guess I am looking for advice to make the situation go as smooth as possible, or for similar stories from others.

About 6 years ago, shortly after my 34th Bday (I am 40 now) I begun to develop various tics like blinking and scrunching my eyes, and taking short series of quick, fast and jerky breaths.

I'm absolutely almost at the end of my rope here with them, and even just talking about it is a big help.

I however was one of the minority an average height and weight male. I have a lean muscular frame with light brown hair and blue eyes. I am wearing a collared shirt with the universities logo on it and a pair of beige khakis. It was my job to assist the professor as a T.A for the class but the main reason I was hired was because of his lack of knowledge with technology. As such my responsibilities included tracking attendance and grades. If that wasn\u2019t enough I had to constantly be teased from behind the teacher\u2019s desk by the many women in the class who absent mindedly flashed him their panties as they sat there. As a result I often had a rock hard erection hidden by the cover of the desk. The class continued on as per normal as I look around the room loading pictures onto the projector as I see the attendance sheet make its way around.\n\n========================================================\n\nI am looking for a detailed roleplay partner 18+. I am 28 and I am a T.A (Teachers Assistant) at a local university and its close to the new semester. The professor is very old and not used to technology and as such I have control over most things (grades, attendance, etc.) And this is all IRL. Nothing gets me harder and gets my imagination running more than looking at all the female students who know I am the real reason if they pass or fail. Even more so staring at them from the front of class and catching glimpses up their skirts. The University I attend is mostly women too which only makes it worse having to constantly hide my erection.\n\nIf you are interested in being one of the students let me know ;) I will send kinks and limits in private message.\n\n=========================================================\n\nAnother thing is that I am a Switch as in I can play either a Dom or Sub. Seeing as the Sub side of very rarely gets scratched I will put out that I am also actively looking for roleplays where we can explore this. I am a light sub when it comes to those roles and will go over those specific kinks and limits separately if that is something you are wanting to explore.\n\n==========================================================\n\nI also do other prompts if you check my profile and like those as well or if you have other ideas I am open to listening. I am almost always online but not necessarily able to RP but you can message me whenever.\n\nI prefer partners who don't just ghost after a couple of hours and will either want to continue an RP or start a new one.

I have always been wary of having anything about my pregnancy online and already know that when my child is born they will not exist as far as the internet is concerned unless you are a close friend or relative. This experience has solidified that.\n\nI was friends with a girl named Julia online but have never met her. I am 23 now but I have had all of my socials since I was in middle school mostly and she is someone who managed to find herself on my friend list back when I would just accept anyone. We never really interacted much until I decided to announce said pregnancy online.\n\nJulia is around my age, and single as far as I could tell. She always posts the \"who wants to hang out\" type of comments and statuses so eh might be a strong assumption but whatever. When she saw my update though she reacted as if she knew me personally and was overjoyed. She congratulated me and told me that she was currently pregnant as well.I didn't think much of this because babies just make everyone happy right? Even random strangers. I congratulated her too and that was that. I went about making a few more pregnancy related posts and among them was a picture of my ultrasound.\n\nJulia sent me a DM a few days later which was pretty weird but again, who cares right? It was all pregnancy related. She wanted to know what I was having, who my doctor was, which tests ive taken so far, if I had baby names picked etc. Honestly the most that got from me was an eyeroll. no real red flags to me. Granted there should have been since she didnt live particularly close to me so why would I think she would need to know my doctor? But I digress I thought she was just one of those pregnant people who cant shut up about pregnancy. So I answered her and even told her a name I was thinking about , but thankfully not the one I'm really choosing because I did kind of think there was a chance she may take it! Which is fine, but I still wanted to keep it private.\n\nA full week and a half passed and I got bored and was looking for people to snoop on. Julia was high up in my DMs so I clicked the handy little \"go to profile\" button just to see what was up etc and to see if she posted any pregnancy updates because honestly babies make me happy too and she seemed harmless. Red flags started flying like crazy.\n\nI was no longer friends with her and she was no longer friends with any of our mutual friends either. we had only had a handful to begin with but you get the point. the second issue was that her ultrasound picture looked awfully familiar. Why? Because it was mine. She had cropped my name out, but comparing the picture all of the details (including the date) were the exact same. Even the doctors office was the same. Which like I said, she doesn't live very close to me. The caption to the picture said \"introducing my little angel (name I told her I was going to be using)\" and then my due date which thankfully has since changed!\n\nThe only post I looked at before sending her a message and then blocking her was one where she was \"updating\" her friends on what her next appointment is supposed to entail. You guessed it, it was the same stuff I told her (like a dumbass) that I was dreading doing in my next appointment.\n\nI essentially told her that if she didnt take the picture down I would be reporting her and messaging anyone who commented on her posts directly. I never got a response as I blocked her, I intended to keep tabs on her through my partners account.\n\nShe took the posts down and told her friends and family that she was just \"pranking them\" in a long rant and about how \"someone\" got too emotional and butthurt about it and killed the fun.\n\nIt still unnerves me knowing she exists which is why my account is now as private as it can be and I have already set the rule that no one is allowed to post anything about mybaby or pregnancy besides me and my partner! If I see it I will literally block them, family or not.\n\nNot sure if I went too overdramatic about it but to me its really creepy and a huge violation of privacy and trust. She messaged me from a random account to apologize and claimed she had had a miscarriage within the last few months and just wanted to experience doing a \"reveal\" etc and that she didnt mean to freak me out. But like...who does that though?\n\nJulia....stay away from my baby...and lets not meet.

Depression is something that runs in my family and a disease that I have struggled with since middle school, I am 24 now as of yesterday. I do not like blaming my shortcoming in life on my illness because I am stronger than it and have accomplished much in my life. However, because of depression, my life appears to be falling apart around me. \n\nIn middle school and high school, I failed multiple classes, but after my freshman year, I turned that all around. I was in honors classes and was subsequently kicked out of them due to my grades. By my senior year, I had managed to get back into honors classes and took AP Chem and fell in love with the topic. I decided to pursue it in college as well as teaching. I had always wanted to be a teacher and decided to teach chemistry.\n\nFreshman year of college was great, but also terrible. I did well in my classes, but was dealing with my mental illness. In high school I had started dating my current girlfriend, a total of 7 years, and because of the distance, and being away from home for the first time, I was severely homesick. Because of this and the stress of school, I was having daily panic attacks and was given an ultimatum from my girlfriend, get help or we were done. That sounds harsh, but she knows me better than anyone and knew that was the only way to convince me to get help. I saw a therapist regularly and began taking Prozac. On to the next year.\n\nSophomore year of college, I moved into an apartment with some acquaintances. With my new found freedom and older friends, I stopped going to class and started drinking and smoking cigarettes. I failed calculus and physics both semesters and was almost booted from college. I fell right back into the hole that I was in, in high school. I had no choice but get back on the grind. \n\nThe following year I made a complete 180, but ultimately decided not to peruse education because of self doubt about my ability to teach. Instead I studied chemistry only, and graduated only one semester late. \n\nFinding a job out of college in chemistry was near impossible and was forced to work with a staffing agency. The job I got was great, but I was not making much money and was working a night shift, which led to my depression to worsen once again. I decided to quit that job and follow my dreams of becoming a teacher.\n\nThe past six months have been amazing. I\u2019ve been going to college to get my teaching degree and working as a substitute teacher at my old school. My girlfriend finished school as a nurse and is working a great job, with great pay and benefits. When I finished student teaching, next spring 2020, we were going to move in together and get engaged finally. In the meantime we would continue to live with our respective parents. \n\nUntil today, when I went to apply for student teaching and discovered that my core gpa is a 2.89, when it needs to be a 3.0. She is at work and I\u2019ve been having a panic attack for the last two hours. I can\u2019t stop pacing, until I began to write this post. I feel as if all my hopes and dreams and plans have just collapsed because of an excel spreadsheet. Best case scenario, I am still able to student teach in the spring of 20. Worst case scenario, I cannot student teach until fall of 20 or longer. If I student teach in the fall of 20, it sets our plans back an entire year, as I will not find a job in the middle of a school year. \n\nI feel awful about delaying her life any further. She\u2019s been nothing except supportive. She has paid for trips, dinners, and activities since I cannot on a substitute teachers pay. In the middle of my panic attack, I was going to leave and buy a ring and get engaged tonight because I feel so lost. My entire life is screwed and there\u2019s nothing I can do.\n\nTLDR: I messed up in school previously. Now at 24 I will have to go another at school to finish my teaching certificate and become a teacher.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"depression","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqqf","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/depression","subreddit_subscribers":494058,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Life falling apart","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/depression\/comments\/avyne7\/life_falling_apart\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I was also struggling with compulsory heterosexuality, I felt trapped that I HAD to be hetro and forced myself to be.  I'm looking for any kind of self help, healing books to help me through this process. I've found a few books but honestly most of them are for gay men and I'd really like some specifically for\/by lesbians. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank so much everyone.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"actuallesbians","subreddit_id":"t5_2rch0","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/actuallesbians","subreddit_subscribers":167487,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Books for recovering from abusive homophobia, trauma, coming out etc","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/actuallesbians\/comments\/avyo95\/books_for_recovering_from_abusive_homophobia\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I will also be filing an OSHA claim, and would like to participate if there is a lawsuit.

Can he do that? One of my friends recommended going in to the office, taking the paper and not the check, and using it as evidence in the potential lawsuit. Its not a huge check, only like $150, but I really need the money and I worked the hours for it. On a side note, I have never been paid overtime pay despite working 40+ hour weeks and there were certain times where i was paid under the table, in cash, less than minimum wage and neither I or the company had to pay taxes on it. The owner also has claimed we are not allowed to discuss our wages, which i know is illegal. My main concern is what I should do when I go into the office tomorrow to hopefully collect the check and sign\/not sign the paper. Any advice of class action lawsuits\/OSHA claims would be appreciated as well though! Also I do know that none of these papers he has people sign are notarized contracts, and his \u201clawyer\u201d is not actually a lawyer and someone that just used to work at the Sheriffs office and claims to be the owners legal representation.

I however was one of the minority an average height and weight male. I have a lean muscular frame with light brown hair and blue eyes. I am wearing a collared shirt with the universities logo on it and a pair of beige khakis. It was my job to assist the professor as a T.A for the class but the main reason I was hired was because of his lack of knowledge with technology. As such my responsibilities included tracking attendance and grades. If that wasn\u2019t enough I had to constantly be teased from behind the teacher\u2019s desk by the many women in the class who absent mindedly flashed him their panties as they sat there. As a result I often had a rock hard erection hidden by the cover of the desk. The class continued on as per normal as I look around the room loading pictures onto the projector as I see the attendance sheet make its way around.\n\n========================================================\n\nI am looking for a detailed roleplay partner 18+. I am 28 and I am a T.A (Teachers Assistant) at a local university and its close to the new semester. The professor is very old and not used to technology and as such I have control over most things (grades, attendance, etc.) And this is all IRL. Nothing gets me harder and gets my imagination running more than looking at all the female students who know I am the real reason if they pass or fail. Even more so staring at them from the front of class and catching glimpses up their skirts.

I'm 5'3 and roughly 110 pounds so I'm *VERY* easily intimidated.  Me and quite frankly all of my friends are bisexual, pansexual, or lesbians, and we are all openly out and comfortable with ourselves so wearing pride shirts in public for us wasn't a big deal. I attend a very progressive high school that even has GSA (Gay-Straight-Alliance) for the LGBTQ+ and supportive straight students to hang out and make friends who have at least one thing in common, this is how I met my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(P.S. sorry for formatting and such as this is my first post on Reddit.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friends and I go out for coffee on weekends a lot to catch up on each others lives, drama, etc. And the day that this takes place just so happens to be National Bisexual Visibility Day (September 23, 2018), so naturally my friends and I dressed very deliberately homosexual that day. Anyways, we arrive at the cafe and take our seats in usual spot in the corner, place our orders and begin rambling on about our weeks and family dilemmas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cafe wasn't very busy, as most aren't on Saturdays at *TEN PM*, but there was a father in his late 20's early 30's and what I assume is his son who looked to be 10 or 11 sitting at a table close behind us (father and son will be referred to as EP and EK from now on.) EP gave us the stink eye as we walked in but I assumed it was because we were a group of 4 teenagers rolling into a cafe to disturb their precious peace and quiet, not because of our clothes. (By the way, 2 of us were wearing love wins shirts, one had a t-shirt with the bisexual flag colors on it, and the other was holding the bisexual flag.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe all jump on the topic of sexuality now, mostly our funny coming out stories and how we began to know we weren't straight. I noticed that the EP was scoffing and slamming his hands down whenever somebody said \"Gay\", \"Lgbt\", or \"pride\". The others didn't seem to notice so I didn't acknowledge it or suggest we move somewhere else in the cafe to not upset him more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis, my dear Redditors, was my first fuck up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe jump onto the topic of politics and the roll it plays in our community, the conversation goes something like this. **Warning: I'm about to share my opinion on Trump, try not to get your panties in a knot or stop reading.** \"I'm a firm believer that Trump should not be impeached, Why? Mike Pence is a real politician, someone who knows what they're doing (unlike Trump) and someone who will make the bad things our country doesn't want faster than Trumps Pea Brain could ever conceive. I don't think trump is homophobic, I believe he says what the majority of his fans wan't him to say so he hold's his place of power. However Pence is actually homophobic and\", to put it short and sweet, \"would ***ELIMINATE THE GAYS***.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*EP didn't like that, no he didn't, for we had insulted his president.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis chair *screeches* back in pure rage, and so it begins.\n\nEP: How DARE you speak about the president in that way?! Not to mention you speaking about homosexuality in front of EK!\n\nI shit you not this dude had the thickest yeehaw accent I had ever heard, Iowans tend to have Canadian accents, not southern.\n\nFriend 1: Excuse me?\n\nEP: You heard me little boy.\n\nFriend 1: First of all, don't call me little boy, second, the first amendment protects free speech I can say whatever the hell I want about anyone.\n\nFriend 2: Not to mention YOU are the one listening to OUR conversation. Don't like it? Don't eavesdrop.\n\nEP: Don't tell me what to do *FAGGOT.*\n\nThe F word stings my ears like a god damn 1000 degree glowing knife. I'm shaking in pure shock, by now I was probably having an anxiety attack, but for the sake of my friends I kept my cool (on the outside at least).\n\nEP: I can't believe you would let my son hear that conversation, let alone see in those horrendous shirts.\n\nFriend 3: How old is your son?\n\nEP: 15.\n\n...\n\nFucking 15. Baby face syndrome much?\n\nMe: You know most people figure out their sexuality at around 13-14, so I really don't think that homosexuality is inappropriate for him to learn about, considering he's probably had the sex-ed talk at least twice already.\n\nEP: ARE YOU TELLING ME HOW TO PARENT YOU DYKE?!\n\nThe commotion attracts a cashier\n\nC: What is going on over here?\n\nFriend 3: This man is harassing us and calling us derogatory names.\n\nEP: These faggots keep discussing sinful topics in front of my son.\n\nCashier: Sir please leave, you can't harass costumers or use that word in this cafe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo our surprise, he huffs, puffs, and complies, grabbing his drink and walking out the door with EK following behind. EK flips us off on the way out but we couldn't care less at that point. We finished our drinks and left with a kick ass story to tell at GSA on Monday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: This cafe is 24\/7 and my friends and I had just left a house party, that's why we were there so late.\n\nEdit 2: spelling errors.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"entitledparents","subreddit_id":"t5_358dh","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/entitledparents","subreddit_subscribers":620591,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Dad Lashes Out At My Friends and Me for \"Speaking Of Sinful Topics\" in Front of his 15-YEAR-OLD SON","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/entitledparents\/comments\/avyrhc\/dad_lashes_out_at_my_friends_and_me_for_speaking\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I have been deaf since I was 1-2 years old. My mom raised me orally, so I can hear and speak, and I currently have Cochlear Implants in both ears. My parents divorced when I was about 6-7 years old and I was in my mom's custody.\n\n\u200b\n\nMy dad would send my mom money every month, but she'd never spend them well. We sometimes lived without heating during winter, because she wouldn't pay for the bills. She'd rely on my grandpa for money too, but she'd still send me to stay at my grandparents' and keep my older sister with her. I would lock myself in a room and she'd say she wouldn't send me to my grandparents, but she wouldn't keep her words when I would unlock the room. So I would hang on to things and cry while she'd pull me. I didn't want to go to my grandparents' because my grandpa once hit me with a belt. However, my mom did hit me a lot. Sometimes she'd use a wooden rolling pin to hit me (i.e on my hands). When I once confronted her about it, her excuse was that I was an 'animal' because I was deaf. She'd hit my sister too, and she was hearing, but she'd hit her less than me. So yes, I lived with abuse. In 2015, she moved to Denmark with my sister to go to university and let me live with my grandparents. Now she is doing a Bachelor's again, as she gets money from the state and works part-time. She doesn't want to ever work full-time. As you can imagine, she is broke, and still doesn't pay her rent at times.\n\n\u200b\n\nShe promised that I'd go to Denmark in high school, but then when I brought up applying to a high school there, she freaked out and told me not to apply (I still did and was rejected, dammit). At the same time, I applied for a scholarship that would let me go to the US for a year in high school for free, and I got it. I lived with an American host family, and I really enjoyed my experience. After I finished that, I decided I'd move again. I didn't want to live with my grandparents in misery anymore. My grandparents and I went on a 'trip' to Denmark. I only bought a one-way ticket, because I hella knew I wasn't going to go back. They didn't know that until a few weeks before we left. I applied to a few international high schools in Sweden and got accepted to a few. I stayed at a friend's place for 3 months until I'd move in to my dorm (as my contract would start on August 1st and I went there in June). I had to stay at her place because my mom would never host me - I know because I asked her. She has even threatened me during my stay in Sweden (i.e that she would call my school).\n\n\u200b\n\nMy dad passed away in October, and he was paying my rent. He was paying for a mortgage for the apartment I and my mom lived in (which she somehow sold). His wife probably ran away with his money, since he kept all his money under her name as the bank would have taken anything he would have had. I don't have any inheritance, despite that my dad once mentioned he had 6000 EUR for me (probably in his wife's account). My stepmom did pay for my rent for 2 months, but then she suddenly left to another country. My grandparents send me money, but it's only for living costs such as food and public transportation. Some months I just live on instant noodles (thank God I get free lunch at school). I've been looking for a job, but it's really difficult to find one without having Swedish speaking skills. My mom will never help me financially. For all I know, I might become homeless. I do have some money from a scholarship I got for rent, but it only covers me for a few months. The state doesn't help me financially as I don't have a permanent residence permit and\/or family in Sweden.\n\n\u200b\n\nSo, would it be possible to be adopted by a Swedish family? I know I am 18, but it would be really lovely to live with a family. I really enjoyed my time with my host family, just the part that I was living with a normal family and without abuse. I could even learn Swedish as I am planning to settle down somewhere here. And I wouldn't have to live as a broke ass student who might become homeless.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nTLDR: My mom was abusive and doesn't care about me. I can't really pay my rent as my dad passed away (he was paying it for me) and I've been looking for a job, but it's really hard to get a job interview without speaking Swedish.

She claimed that she had to go home early to study but tell me how during the entire car ride back to where I was staying she was busy texting a guy from Tinder who she said she was gonna have come over to hook up. \n\nSo is it just me that\u2019s not getting the hint, or what?\n\nShe falls in love with guys in a matter of a day, and she becomes obsessed to the point of showing up at their job if they don\u2019t text her back. \n\nShe drinks I want to say about 5 times a week, but I would not be surprised if I found out it was 7. \n\nAlso, she is so rude and condescending.. According to her if you don\u2019t have a 9-5 Monday-Friday job then \u201cit\u2019s not a real job.\u201d ..Yeah that was great for me to hear while i was struggling and serving at a restaurant.. I could go on with snide remarks like that, but I\u2019ll refrain. \n\nSo, do I continue to compassion despite her NEVER texting me anymore, or do I officially dump and delete her?\n\n\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"nofriends","subreddit_id":"t5_2sr22","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/nofriends","subreddit_subscribers":1946,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My best friend is an boy crazy + an alcoholic.","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nofriends\/comments\/avyuyj\/my_best_friend_is_an_boy_crazy_an_alcoholic\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I generally like to play the older sibling but again can play the younger if that is what you'd prefer.

I enjoy sports, video games, board games, Netflix, going to the movies and more that you can find out when you message me. I don't really have any limits besides scat, pee and rape.

Because of this, his unit was in charge, and had a steam locomotive as a helper unit. I was allowed to ride and be obedient inside the locomotive, and after I got on, we loaded in passengers who bought tickets. I saw the Mom and her son (about 5 years old), and this is where the entitlement BS starts.\n\nEntitled Mom: EM\n\nEntitled Birthday Boy: EBB (no airsoft hints)\n\nMe = Just me, no changes.\n\nRailroad Uncle = RU\n\nIt started off as when they were about to depart the station for our short excursion. The kid looked happy and a frantically hopped while looking at our train, and he had some kind of birthday cone hat. when I opened the cab window and looked out. Then, EM points at our locomotive, and they walk up to the locomotive. RU tells me to move aside, and he speaks to the child.\n\nEM: Excuse me, sir.\n\nRU: Yes, ma'am?\n\nEM: My son loves trains, and he really appreciates seeing you guys run your trains.\n\nRU: Thank you, that lightens me up.\n\nEBB: MOMMY! I WANNA RIDE THE CHOO-CHOO TRAIN! (Southern Steam Loco #4501 was assisting as a helper, so the kid's half-naive)\n\nEM: Is it possible my little angel could ride in the train on his birthday, It will make his day!\n\nRU: Sorry ma'am, you need to have purchased a ticket, and you can't ride in here, it's restricted to Railroad personnel only.\n\nAt this point, EM begins to get pissed.\n\nEM: I'm sorry, but how come the kid is riding?\n\nRU: He is just my cousin, he will stay with me for a few hours. Sorry ma'am, you could've purchased a ticket and rode in the coaches.\n\nEM: You are very rude, could you please let him ride? I'll come with him, you are making his heart crushed.\n\nRU: Sorry ma'am, for the last time, it's railroad property.\n\nEM: I cannot believe, you are a rude son of a b\\*tch. You just ruined my son's birthday.\n\nEBB: I WANNA RIDE THE TRAIN!!! (Starts crying like a little brat)\n\nRU: Sorry ma'am, you cannot ride at all.\n\nEM then whispers to her son, as his son starts getting jumpy and excited.\n\n*EM Begins to climb the steps*, and opens the cab door. I rush to the door, and I try to keep it closed.\n\nME: MA'AM, LIKE WHAT MY UNCLE SAID, YOU CANNOT DO THIS.\n\nEM *ignores* and *leaves* her son. She takes out the camera to take a pic (bad time to do it).\n\nRU calls into dispatch to let them know, and the station headmaster watches it. He comes outside and tries to help confront the woman, but failed.\n\nI rush to her, and I try to grab her hands and take her down to the police car parked at the station.\n\nEM: **LET GO OF ME YOU MOLESTER! POLICE, THIS GUY IS ASSAULTING ME AND MY SON! I WILL PRESS CHARGES!**\n\nRU gets the child and safely brings it over to the platform. The EM is screaming like hell into the Officer's face, explaining the shit in a wacky way, yet there were other people at the station with evidence.\n\nThe officer is kind enough to listen to our story, and 3 other people's stories. When the officer finishes up, the woman and her son try to run off to their car, but there was another officer still in the car. He went for the woman, and slowed her down, and putting the son an child in the backseat of the light patrol car. They drove off, and RU talked to dispatch about the situation. RU asked me to go down to the station headmaster, and ask what will happen to those people.\n\n**The response:** I have no idea bud, but if I see them again, they are getting the boot.\n\nSo yeah, after that, we were still able to depart the station. I got back on, and we left the station.\n\nThat's the end of the story. It sounds confusing, but it is, as people are dumb and won't take no for an answer. This is 100% real, and this was the first time I probably encountered him. (Btw I am 14 currently, so calculate it).\n\nLessons here: Don't ride restricted property after they say no.

I'm Liz Darling and I am a uber driver. I am 30 years old with a husband and three kids. All three of them are girls. My poor husband does most of the work while I'm taking normal shifts or night shifts. He is a stay at home father and my daughters names are, Iris, Reilly, And Georgia. So when i was younger my spare time wouldn't be playing it would be me drawing scary and unusual things. So I would like you to hear them because it is just so bizarre. The first one is of a man, it has a bio to it so here it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"This is Drake. He is very kind. He was in my dream once and told me to be careful what i wish for. I don't know what that means... maybe i'll find out.\" So the day after that i was sitting at my wishing well that i had in my backyard. I was wishing for money and i dropped my wish in. I got tons of money after that, my dad won the lotto but the weird thing is, was that i got so much attention that i was smothered at school. Maybe that's what that Drake meant...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis next one was a woman. There was a actual wishing well in my dream this time. She seems to be touching the wishing well. Here is what the bio says. \"This is America. She told me as well to be careful what i wish for. I wonder if she means my well... what should i wish for?\" The next day i went to my well and wished for a dog. The next day my dad came home with a french bulldog. It was cute and we named it Frenchie. It was very mean towards me though. It tried biting me multiple times. After awhile i started getting hints of what they meant. You can wish for good but sometimes the outcome isn't good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe third one is of a girl named Melinda. Here is the bio \"Melinda, Melinda. She carries the great but brings out the worst. Melinda, Melinda, she said the well is a curse.\" Who knew i was a poem writer when i was six! I went to the well the next day and wished to have my brother back from the army. The next day he ringed on the doorbell. I opened the door to find him shot. He fell on the floor and i was sobbing. I screamed \"MOMMY, DADDY, COME HERE!\" To my surprise he was okay. I would have thought he was dead from the cursed well but he ended up being paralyzed in his right arm from the shot. I said to him \"I'm sorry about your arm. Melinda told me to go to the well\" As a six year old i didn't understand what Melinda meant. I did know what the meaning of curse was but it wasn't real to me i thought \"It's just a dream...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe fourth and final drawing was this same Melinda girl. The bio said \"Melinda, tall, skinny, brown hair, brown eyes, loves wells. She told me the well was a curse and now i believe her\" The next day i went to the well again. I dropped my coin in and and my wish was \"I wish Frenchie was kind to me\" Then Frenchie stopped biting me because she became ill. I can't believe it! a few days later Frenchie died. I blamed myself and wished to take everything back. The funny thing is... That wish didn't come true...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll the others did except one... Once you wish you can't ever take it back... I guess that's why the saying \"Be careful what you wish for\" Became a thing... Right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"nosleep","subreddit_id":"t5_2rm4d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/nosleep","subreddit_subscribers":13203613,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"The Drawings I Did As a Kid Happen In Real Life","total_awards_received":2,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/avz1pi\/the_drawings_i_did_as_a_kid_happen_in_real_life\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

About 5 years ago, I started an online friendship with a girl I used to work with. At the time, she was married and had 3 kids. I never took it seriously and we talked a lot and became good friends.\n\nAbout 4 months into our friendship, she said things with her husband weren't going so great. He had admitted to having an affair with another woman while away on business and she felt ignored. I tried to listen to her and give her strength and support. After 3 months of chatting we agree to have coffee. This wasn't strange because I used to work with her and we knew each other previously.\n\nAs the months went on, she told me that she was starting to develop strong feelings toward me. I tried my best to ignore it to protect myself but, since I am single and didn't have anything else going on, got really attached to her. \n\nI am a male, so physical attraction is of course important. This girl was a 10. I know that men say that a lot, but, I can honestly say she was the prettiest girl I've ever known personally. I'd be lying if this didn't have an enormous effect on me. That being said, her personality was special too. I've know beautiful women in the past, but she wasn't prissy or Barbie-like worrying about her appearance all the time. So had a tomboyish angle to her too and had a great sense of humour. \n\nContrary to what most men say, sex can be emotional to some extent for males too. There were a couple times that she was away on business and invited me to her hotel room, but although went kissed and cuddled, I didn't have sex with her because I didn't like the idea of doing that to another man and also because it might complicate things.\n\nWe carried on like this off and on for almost 3 years. The whole time she was still in her bad marriage. Around mid 2017, she told me she was going to separate from him. She would have the 3 kids and move out. I thought that this would give us more time together. She didn't message as much as she did but chalked it up to her going through a bitter and emotional breakup.\n\nAround late summer 2017, she told me that she felt things had changed between us and that we wanted different things. She said she didn't want anymore kids and said that I did, although I said that it would be nice but definitely not a deal breaker. She said we could remain friends. I said I didn't want to and only wanted her as my gf.\n\nIn October 2017, one night, after months of not speaking, a mutual friend told me that she now has a new bf. I was crushed. What was interesting was the date on her IG post. It was only 2 weeks after she dumped me. This proved she was talking to another guy during in the months leading up to her separation. She probably wanted to size both men up to see who was more committed. She also used a lame excuse that a year earlier I told her I wanted a child someday as an easy out.\n\nAlmost 2 years have passed and I haven't spoken to her since. That is until a couple months ago.\n\nFirst, she started liking the past few FB posts I made, which was strange because she hadn't done so for months. Before you ask why I didn't delete her from FB, I wasn't about to give her the satisfaction and rarely use it these days anyway.\n\nThis past weekend, I, by accident after having one too many pressed the wrong button on my phone and up popped her FB profile. She is still with the guy. Me, in a drunken state,for whatever reason FB messaged her hello. Luckily that was it. I didn't say anything else.\n\nThe next morning I noticed she wrote back \"hi.\" I read the message but didn't reply. What's there to say? I don't want to start a convo with a girl who did this to me.\n\nWhy do I still feel hurt about this at this point? Why does my heart still ache for her. Can someone tell me what happened and how to proceed? I haven't looked at her FB page until last week and only then I saw her profile pic with him in it. Thanks.\n\ntl;dr: My ex gf and I have been apart almost 2 years. She has been with a new bf for almost the whole time. I have tried to move on but a recent setback has made that difficult for me.
