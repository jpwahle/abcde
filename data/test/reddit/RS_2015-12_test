I just need advice on what to do!\n\nSo, the 20 year old guy was my first love. We were together for a year and four months and we broke up in September. We met on a dating app- Hot or not. He lived 3 hours away and during our relationship we saw each other 2 times- but a total of 5 days. I have a lot of trust issues because of my parents- they would cheat on each other, and they were abusive and compulsive liars. So, I always accused him of cheating. I accused him, because I had seen he was still on the dating app and actively using it. We finally said we needed a break. So then I re-download the dating app and I meet the 18 year old a week later (around sept. 25?) Broke up with 20 year old officially on sept 21.\nSo the 18 year old. We talked for about two weeks and finally met up on Oct. 9. Went to the mall, walked around and had dinner. Then we seen each other a month later- I went to his house and I was still 16(birthday just passed) and it was my first time there and he wanted me to meet his mom- she hated me. She even asked me to leave. She said I was too young for him. Which where I live, in North Carolina you can be 16 and be with someone 4 years older than you. So then about a week later he snuck over to my house pretty much, and we had our first kiss between each other and had sex. Then on thanksgiving his mother was out of town and I slept over. We had sex, then we got drunk had sex- fell asleep- he got sick and threw up all on his floor- I cleaned it up and did laundry (it was about 3 am) and then we woke up and had sex. He took me home. But the thing with him, he barely texts me. I always see him liking photos on instagram and watching my snap chat story. His excuse is always \"sorry i was busy at work\" but if he really was why can't he text back but be on social media? \nI am not sure if he's using me or what. I asked told him 9 days ago, that I had really started to like him but I did not want a friends with benefits, and I asked if that's what we were. He said he really liked me and he wouldn't consider it friends with benefits because he's not that type of guy. He does want something more but doesn't want to rush into it. He also said he is a very busy guy and he has a lot on his plate. He also then said he doesn't want to lead girls on because he knows how it would feel and he wouldn't want to do that. \nI also messaged my ex to see how he was, and he had mentioned getting back together. But, his parents did not like the fact that I am 17 and he is 20. So, I am not sure what to do here.\n\nSo, what's everyones thoughts?

I'm 22 years old, a registered nurse, live in a cozy apartment with my amazing boyfriend, bought myself a brand new car, etc. In elementary and high school, I was really against weed. I also don't drink much, even to this day because I have an intolerance to alcohol and it usually just makes me really sick even after only a couple. When I started university, my friend had a vaporizer. My group of friends and I would vape maybe once or twice a week in my dorm room and it was always a really fun time. After a few months of this, I bought some of my own weed for the first time. My residence was right next to an escarpment with beautiful trails and was a very close by spot to go and have a quick smoke. I would roll a joint, venture out, smoke about a third of it, and come back completely baked. I would watch movies, listen to music, read, sometimes even do homework (weed actually helps me to concentrate somehow). By second year, I was smoking every day. My boyfriend (the same one as today, though he quit weed due to anxiety) introduced me to bong the summer before second year. From there, I was officially a stoner. for the last few years, I have smoked mostly every day. I had a joint phase, I had a pipe phase, but for the most part I love my bong. That is all I smoke now. It is to the point that I can smoke 3-4 consecutive bowls before feeling anything at all. When I smoke with my friends, if I'm with any, they sometimes ask me if I'm high and no matter how much I smoked my answer is always meh I guess I've got a buzz. If it barely does anything anymore, why the heck do I still smoke it every day? Why is it the first thing I do when I get up in the morning (on days off, as I would never smoke and go to a shift as a nurse), the first thing I do when I get home, what I do before every single meal, before going anywhere, etc? I have a bit of a cough, always. I'm always clearing my throat. I'm afraid of what it is doing to my brain long term since I have a job that requires using my brain constantly. Since I can easily go a 12 hour shift without smoking, I don't think I am physically addicted (I don't have withdrawals or daydream about it at work). At this point I don't know why I do it anymore. Habit? Something to do? My way of relaxing? Ive tried to quit a few times before and I never make it past a few days. I get bored. My mind ends up convincing me to just smoke again, no big deal. I end up scraping my grinder clean and telling myself that it's just a bit so it doesn't count but that just makes me want more. This time, I really want to quit. I don't know if I can. I don't know what my end goal is... if I just want to take a t break, if I want to be a social smoker (if I'm even able to without relapsing), or if I want to never touch it again. I just know that I'm sick of the cough. I'm sick of clearing my throat. Sick of the feeling I get when my weed starts to get low. Today is Monday and I've been thinking for a week that when my weed is finished I'm going to try and go at least until saturday. I smoked the last of it last night. So far I feel ok, I still want to quit. But I'm afraid that in 2 or 3 days I'm going to do the same thing I always do and convince myself that it's not a big deal and that since it doesn't affect me work it's not that big of an issue. How can I cut it out of my life? How can I improve my will power so that it doesn't screw me over in a few days? I feel so lost and hopeless about it. I feel like I've tried everything and I can never stay motivated enough to follow through. Any help, tips and support would be much appreciated. I just want to not want to smoke. I want to not crave it. I want to not be bored without it. I want to enjoy meals without smoking. I want to be excited just to finish a day of work and get home, not excited to finish a day of work so I can go home and smoke weed and \"relax\". Thank you for listening to my story.

My SO and I went to an intake appointment a week or so ago, and they ran lots of blood tests. One of them came back showing my a1c is 5.6 and normal is anything &lt;5.7, so I'm very borderline pre-diabetic. This was scary to me, but also not surprising because my dad has type 2 diabetes and although I'm in pretty good shape, I eat a lot of carbs and don't work out enough. So I've started eating healthy and going for walks in the mornings which is nice! Anyways, I'm worried because I've seen people post stories (elsewhere on the Internet) about going for their first scan at let's say 10 weeks and it shows the baby stopped growing at 8 weeks. I'm a little confused about how if they miscarried, they didn't know. I'm scared this could happen to me and I'll be met with such grief at the first appointment. I thought miscarriages were always accompanied by blood and/or cramping. I have not had any reason to believe I miscarried, but my symptoms have been rather light. I'm just confused on that.

I'm going to share with you a story about a few weird occurrences that have happened to me over the last 3 years. Call it what you will, but I am posting this as a way to document what all has gone on, and I figured sharing it for everyone else to read would be a fun way to do so. Enjoy.\n\nLet me start by giving you a little background information on myself. \nMy name is Franck, and I am 21 years old, currently attending a university. I am pretty involved and tend to stay busy. \nI have been here for 3 years, and I will (hopefully) be finished within the next year or so. \n\nLet me begin.\n\nIn my 2nd semester of my first year of college, I began to read about lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming is the act of creating consciousness while inside of a dream. So, pretty much, you realize that you are in a dream state and the opportunities are endless and your imagination can become a momentary reality.\nI wasn't attempting to try and lucid dream, but it fascinated me to no end. One night, I read an (what seemed like) easy way to begin trying lucid dreaming. I ignored it and I didn't really feel like investing the amount time that the process required.\nAs I was reading the last paragraph of the article, one of my friend's from high school messaged me. His name was Roger. We had not spoken in nearly 2 years, yet he went on to tell me that he had begun lucid dreaming. There was an obvious despair that he was experiencing, yet he wouldn't blatantly say \"Yo, look. Shit is happening, don't do what you're thinking about doing (ludic dreaming)\". It was like he wanted to warn me of what would take place, but he didn't want to be the one to break the news to me. As any self-proclaimed know it all, I decided that I would begin the lucid dreaming process and see what the hype is all about. Life was boring, so having a little scare should be fun. Well, that's what I thought, at least.\n\n\nA few months prior to this, my parents went through an incredibly shitty divorce. Being as I am the oldest of my siblings, I had to maintain composure and not let my emotions overrun me. Months after months of hiding how I really felt, I mentally imploded. Physically, I looked the same to everyone around me, but in my head, I was lost. I couldn't form thoughts, I was always limited by myself, I was an emotional wreck. Worst of all, I was alone. I hadn't told anyone of the severity of the depression that I was slipping into, so when it finally hit rock bottom, I had no one to go to. This lead to long hours spent lying awake at night. My mind was my biggest enemy.\n\nI say all of this because your mental state is imperative when lucid dreaming. I did not know this. If you think about it, it makes perfect sense. A depressed person doesn't need an extra 6-8 hours a night where their mind is free to roam and venture to areas that were unfamiliar. After two weeks of taking the steps to lucid dream, I had mastered it. I'm not sure, but it just worked perfectly. Every night, as soon as I drifted into deep sleep, I was completely lucid. Anything I wanted to do, see, or experience, I could experience. It was incredible. So much so that I genuinely looked forward to sleeping every night. \n\nAfter a few months of lucid dreaming just about every night, something unusual began to happen. For example, say I wanted to drive a race car in a dream. I would begin driving the car, yet something would always go wrong. There would be a boat next to me racing, or there would be a glitch, where everything would alter and change for 5 seconds or so. It was always random and always different. Then I would snap back into my dream, driving the race car like nothing ever happened. After a few weeks of having difficulties controlling the dreams, shit began to get serious. I began to experience severe moments of sleep paralysis. The paralysis would last 10 minutes at a time, going back and forth between dreams. I found it difficult to differentiate what was real and what was a dream. This began to affect my social life. Everything was running together. I began hearing voices and seeing things that I knew were only things that I had seen in dreams before. I was never sure whether or not I was dreaming or awake, because it all seemed so scrambled. \n\nThis is where things went south. One night, I was dreaming and immediately transferred into sleep paralysis. However, this time was like nothing I had ever experienced before. I was lying in my college dorm room bed, unable to move, while a woman in a white dress stood in the corner of my dorm room. She was gorgeous. White dress, straight brown hair, beautiful teeth, blue eyes. She looked so sweet. But her smile was so questioning.. a puzzled look would best describe it. Out of nowhere, the sound of a classical symphony began to softly play throughout the room. The music was smooth. It eased my mind. The woman began to smile. This was not a normal smile. After a few minutes, she made direct eye contact with me. At that very moment, it was as if the strings of 50 guitars had been tuned too tightly and all snapped simultaneously. This gut wrenching sound lead to screeches and squeals and deep roars laughter. Terror is the only way to describe. This all happened so quickly, that I had looked away from the woman in the corner of the room. I look over to her, and what I saw will stick with me for the rest of my life. She raised her hand and \"cut\" the music as if she was a maestro. She looked directly above her and placed her right hand on the bottom half of her mouth. Ever so slowly, she ripped the whole bottom half of her mouth off of her face. Her jaw and all of her bottom teeth were separated from her body. Her face was nothing but a top row of teeth and a tongue. Blood dripped on the floor and all down her white dress. She made direct eye contact with me, raised her right, blood covered hand and queued the orchestra music, which was insufferably out of tune. It was one of the worst sounds I have ever heard. The woman smiled. She then skipped to the door and exited my dorm room. As soon as the door closed, I woke up. It was 8pm. I had been asleep for nearly 16 hours. \n \nThis was the beginning of something I was not ready for.

I didn't pick up on my mothers narcissism until a couple years ago when I had it pointed out to me by a therapist that something wasn't right in our relationship and interactions. The therapist didn't try to tell me my mother was an n or anything. It was just a heads up that what I considered normal and not a big deal was in fact, not normal and kind of was a big deal.\n\nI didn't really pursue that line of thought too far. I stumbled across this sub and while I could relate to many of the things others would talk about, my parents were never as awful as a lot of what I read here. And my mother made me insane, but the rest of the world thought she was the most wonderful person ever. I thought it couldn't be her, there was something wrong with me. Thats the family story about me that my parents loved to tell. I was the difficult child, the angry fucked up and uncontrollable one.\n\nI kept talking to my therapist about my mother, though. Every time I saw her I had another incident where my mother said something awful to me, or trivialized my feelings and experiences, told me I was lying, told me she felt I was faking the anxiety and depression problems I have. When I was 30 she'd still tell me she didn't think I was mature enough to be considered an adult yet.\n\nNothing I did was ever right with her, you know? I was a complete doormat at 16, dating an abusive dick twelve years older than me, and when I made the attempt to cut him and his family out my life she told me I was being selfish and should continue the relationships with them because they didn't have anyone else. The guy broke my nose one morning when he asked me to make sure he was up for work on time...and I did what he asked. Definitely a good guy to keep in my life, right? Well I did. And it got worse. And when I finally left him because he broke my hand she ripped into me with a lecture about how I'm too smart to be one of those girls afraid to leave a bad relationship and she expected better of me.\n\nShockingly, the only other long term relationship I've been in was also with an abuser. She spoke highly of him until the day she died, would never believe anything negative I said about him. She told me that whatever I was on about I had to be misunderstanding it because I'm not mature enough to understand how adults live their lives.\n\nShe was diagnosed with cancer back in july, and by the end of september she was dead. I shoved away all the negative thoughts about our relationship so I could help take care of her and my father. \n\nOver 180 people came to her memorial. The church was packed. And most of them came to talk to me about her, and share their stories of how my mom had changed their lives. How supportive and kind she was. How she never had a negative word for anyone. How it was uplifting just to be around her.\n\nAnd ever since all I can wonder is...why the hell did I never get to see that side of her? Why did I only get criticized and screamed at? Why am I apparently the only person in the world who doesn't think my mom was a saint? Whats wrong with me?\n\nA conversation with my father last week at least clued me in to why he'd never defend me from her when she and I argued. He never knew any of the shitty things she'd say to me. She wouldn't tell him or say them in front of him, and I wouldn't tell him because I figured he knew how she felt and agreed so what would be the point? He was shocked when he heard all the times I was told I was a disappointment, etc. \n\nThat tells me that she knew she was being fucked up. If she knew she had to hide it from my father then she knew it was shitty of her. She was intentionally trying to destroy my self esteem and self worth. And she did a great job. Congrats, mom. \n\nI've been feeling guilty over how free I've felt since she got sick and died. I've felt guilty over how I seem to be the only one who, while still sad she's gone, isn't in a deep depression over it. I miss her and I don't. And I'm not really sure how to process all of this. I feel kind of dumb for...something. I don't know what.\n\nI needed to get that out. I can't talk to the people in my life about my mom, they don't believe me.","secure_media":null,"is_self":true,"retrieved_on":1450623415,"author_flair_css_class":null,"from_kind":null,"thumbnail":"self","quarantine":false,"permalink":"/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3uxj88/my_mom_died_its_uncomfortable_how_relieved_and/","gilded":0,"hide_score":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3uxj88/my_mom_died_its_uncomfortable_how_relieved_and/","secure_media_embed":{},"locked":false,"distinguished":null,"media_embed":{}}

So basically, very recently, I got tested for HIV during my blood test; however, since I am 16, my doctor does reach out personally to me when informing me about my results. So, after the test, I received the result that I had Vitamin D deficiency and nothing else on the transcript. And, today, doctor contacted my mother telling her that I should get a urologist appointment without giving my guardian any reason. Now I am panicking. A lot. I haven't had my head rush in such a manner before.\n\n\nHere's some backstory: After telling my doctor that I have engaged in sexual intercourse once before, she said that I should get tested. On top of that, I conversed about a cyst I have in my groin area (which, according to my doctor, again, turned out to be simply a swollen node from whatever reason and was harmless). \n\nCould my doctor be referring me for simply further test/checking out my cyst again or could it be the bad news..?\n\n\n\nEdit: For further information, I have not experienced any of the major HIV symptoms.

I'm 37 and have just started dating full-force almost 4 years ago when I moved to this beautiful city. I came out when I was 30. I've gone through the ups and downs of dating. But this year, I've actually started dating guys for over a month. One of them started in March and ended in August. Recently, I started seeing a new guy. We hooked up at a Halloween party and have spent almost every day since. We had a talk the other day and he felt that we should take a break for a while. He still seems to be interested since he's cool with texting still. But I'm not sure why the sudden change. So I've never been in a relationship and he's aware of that. He's been in several relationships where all of them ended where his boyfriend cheated on him. So far he's been a wonderful guy and I'm giving him his space. But this is affecting me. I know that spending so much time initially probably wasn't a good idea. But me never having a boyfriend and finally connecting with a guy - it sucks that we have to stop all of a sudden. I'm keeping myself busy during this break but I do get emotional about it because I want to hang out with him. \n\nHave you guys been through this kind of break, whether it be dating or a relationship? I can see that this can be healthy for us. But I worry that he won't want to date after we come back and discuss after the break. Also, I'm very honest about my inexperience of being in a relationship and I wonder if it's scaring these guys away.","domain":"self.askgaybros","over_18":false,"author":"andrethegreat78","archived":false,"edited":false,"from_id":null,"saved":false,"created_utc":1448932581,"score":5,"ups":5,"stickied":false,"media":null,"num_comments":8,"title":"Late Bloomer Blues","subreddit":"askgaybros","downs":0,"link_flair_text":null,"from":null,"name":"t3_3uxn7j","id":"3uxn7j"}

Well tonight I got a message from someone who lived just 5 minutes away, he was a year younger than me which perked my interest. I'm 22 and usually you only get older guys, which I like too but I felt more comfortable starting out with someone around the same age.\n\nAnyway we only sent about 5-6 messages back and forth but we agreed to meet up and drive to a secluded spot so I could suck him off in his car. He was a bigger guy, I could tell right away he played football or something. On the way there we had a bit of small talk but nothing much, as soon as we found a spot he leaned back and just took his cock out.\n\nBeing the good Sissy I am I got straight to work, after a few minutes of me worshipping his cock with my tounge he said \"Got a lotta practice huh?\" that made me feel really good, i'v only sucked off one guy before and it was more than a year ago. Practicising with toys really does make perfect.\n\nI was just having the time of my life sucking his cock, he would occasionally put his hand on the back of my head and force me all the way down but if I ever gagged or anything he would immediately lay off. It was really hot, him telling me to suck his cock and suck that hot cum right out. I sucked him off for about an hour actually before he finally came, I was used to maybe 5-10 minutes so this was a real sissy workout. \n\nFinally he grabbed his cock and told me he was cumming, asking if I could handle his big load. And oh man he was not kidding, he shot a good few spurts into my mouth until he was done. I really wish I had been on my knees because some of it dripped out before I could swallow. After I played with his cum for a couple seconds I swallowed it all and we drove back. \n\nI literally just walked in the door and felt like wrighting out what happened because i'm still a little shaky. I was super nervous before hand but as soon as I got in the car all my nerves dissapeared. I just can't believe I really did it, it actually feels amazing. \n\nSo just wanted to say don't be shy!

I've been doing this one routine for scoliosis and it's helped as the pain in my back is pretty minimal now. However, I want to be more structured instead of doing the same routine every day because I don't think it's giving me as much progress as possible.\n\nI can barely do any poses which is the main reason I picked this routine it was one of the only ones I found simple enough that I could do every pose. I'm literally as stiff as a board and my left leg/hip is as hard as a rock and it doesn't really help that I'm 6'6+ so getting into some poses is like tetris. I'm trying to find a routine or a set of routines that's more progression based instead of doing these same poses again and again. I'm also incredibly weak and can't hold myself up for very long and was thinking about doing bodyweight exercises 2-3 times a week instead so I'd be doing yoga 4 days of yoga/3 days of bodyweight.\n\nAnyways my questions are,\n\n**What are some ACTUAL beginner routines I can do?**\n\n The ones online say beginner but then I try them and I can only do one out of every 4 poses they're doing it so it just feels like a waste\n\n**Do you do bodyweight exercises/lift weights or do you feel strong enough from yoga alone?**\n\n**Should I maybe be using a foam roller to supplement my Yoga?** \n\nLike I said I'm extremely tight especially in my hip but I find that I'm not even strong enough to use the foam roller every day. It makes me completely exhausted trying to hold myself up to do it but it really helps. \n\nAny and all advice/criticism welcome and appreciated.

She was younger than most of the woman that taught me in all my years there. More so, she was extremely attractive.\nI'll admit now that I am 14, so, I have hormones providing a bit of a bias. However, if I could possibly persuade you, the reader, that this woman is something more than the average MILF fantasy for a young teenager, then I can tell you a story about how this very woman has bewitched every sense of my being.\nMornings, afternoons, and evenings...all I can think about is Samantha, or Ms. Bennett, as she is called.\nLast year I began guitar lessons with Mr. Crowley, who was the old piano player who did not know anything about playing guitar. Over the Summer break, Mr. Crowley passed away. The church service that week was in remorse, quietly celebrating the life of a man who had committed many years to the church. In my own mind, I was relieved. He was cranky and did not like it when you questioned his authority.\nAt the start of the next year is when I eventually would come to meet Ms. Bennett, whom, I guess, right from the start, had me in her clutches.\nOn my first day of 8th grade, I went to the music studio. It was the same location where Mr. Crowley had taught me. Although Mr. Crowley and I met early in the mornings, this year's schedule would have me meet her at the very end of the school day. So, there I was, not really considering what would happen in the next few moments, probably thinking about other things, such as, determining who was the prettiest girl in homeroom this year.\nThen suddenly, from behind where I was sitting, I felt the warm, gentle hands of someone caress then grip onto my shoulders. It was a lovely feeling. However, I am 14, and again, have jousting hormones coursing through my body. So, in that moment of unexpected pleasure from the touch of an unknown being, I shouted.\nIt was a crackling sound, a kind that I have never made before. I suppose, the only comparison would be when I am laying down in bed while touching myself. During a climax, I may make a sound similar, but not as urgent or, yes, scared. I guess I should call the sound an unexpected sexual shriek.\nI looked behind me to see Ms. Bennett for the first time, and while my face was flush red, I was more readily calmed by the equally scared and shocked smile that looked down at me.\nYes, this is where it all started. This is how everything began.\nHey! Thank you for reading! I hope you enjoyed the prompt. If so, here are some guidelines of the kind of partner I am looking for on this.\n1) Literary approach. Yes, I know, it's asking a lot, and may not be for everyone, but if curious, I can assure you that there are many deep and wonderful pleasures in doing lengthy replies in a prose-type of response.\n2) Flexibility. I have time commitments, and I'm sure you do as well. This is another reason why long-form writing works many wonders, because there is so much to chew on. More substance for a reply. If either one of us should have to break away for a time, that is completely understandable.\n3) Commitment. Toughie, I know. This sub has introduced me to some amazing writers but there is such a lack of wanting to finish what was initially set out from the start. But how, you ask, can I possible measure someone's commitment without giving them a chance? Well, I'm glad you asked...\nSTILL HERE?

It's scary as hell and it's my first time in the adult psych ward. I usually am an inpatient of the adolescent unit. I'm 21 now and I live in Canada.\n\nSo the story is that I tried to kill myself two days ago. The police came and took me to the hospital. Without the cops I wouldnt be typing this on my phone. Not sure if I will have a police record or what. But now I'm getting help... And hopefully proper treatment this time so don't worry about me. However I'd like to give you guys an insight on this old lady. This old lady is staying in the next room. She screams, she howls, she curses at nurses and tells her story of how her husband locked her up here after selling her property. She has been here for a whole **month**. Guys I'm not sure if you've been to a psych ward but stay here for longer than 2 weeks...\n\n\n\n**\"Mental or not you will go insane\"**\n\n\nBut I'm not here to judge her. I'm here to tell you guys that whatever you're going through. At least you're conscious of it. At least you're not all drugged up. You have control. (I know it's quite ironic coming from someone who is suicidal). But it is true. \n\n\nYou guys have troubles and problems that can be worked out. Same as me. I'm learning that. I realized I always told myself that I was a piece of shit for 7 years. And its been ingrained in my head. Much how porn has been ingrained in my head.\n\n\nMy therapist told me that our brain = neuroplasticity. That it takes time but can be rewired to a new and healthier brain. I thought I'd think like this forever that I'll be in chains in my own addictions forever. That I'll be **depressed** and **suicidal** forever. But because I opened up to people... I found hope. Remember the police has to bring me in. \n\n\nThen it struck me. \n\n\n*I realized I don't have to be that old lady next door.*\n\n\nI hope you guys realize that there are other people dealing with mental problems that are deeper and worse than yours...  Worse than mine I feel. Imagine that you have no control of your choices..\n\n\n\nThe real main reason I'm posting this is...\n**I don't want to quit*** that I will try my best to hang on and make it. That I wont kill myself. Because I'm not alone.\n\n\n\nI love you all.\n\n\nEdit: Can't call someone insane.

I've learned that she's not who I need to provide support, and that when she thinks she's helping, she's actually making things worse - mostly by guilting me into sharing things with her so she feels \"in the loop\", when I'd actually rather not share with her, but \"she's my mother\"...\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I finished my 32-week group therapy course (mentalisation-based therapy), and was due to have a one-on-one \"exit interview\" with one of the therapists to discuss how it had been, and what the next step should be.\n\nI had told my mother that I would be having this interview, and so the night before, she emailed me a link that I assume she thought would be helpful.  It was a link to a report on a federal US study (I live in the EU) on **bipolar**.  It was clearly directed at medical staff/medical researchers, and basically outlined who the participants were, and who the sponsors and people carrying out the study were.  The focus of the study was to determine the best course of treatment for bipolar patients, but that was almost the smallest part of the article.  So even if I *had* been bipolar, the article would've been worth squat to me.\n\nI wrote back a pretty frosty email explaining that I am NOT bipolar, but Borderline, and asking her to please stop sending \"helpful\" links as they are always irrelevant and not useful at all.\n\nShe apologised profusely, saying that bipolar is often abbreviated as BPD, too.  Fair enough, except that I'M HER FUCKING CHILD, who she apparently *adores*, not some rando, so you'd think she'd pay attention.  I told her, explicitly, when I was diagnosed A YEAR AGO, that I had Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, borderline type.  It was clearly spelled out, and I didn't even use the BPD abbreviation (I went back through my emails and checked).\n\nI just feel so offended, and yet, not even surprised.  Despite how much she claims to be here for me whenever I need her, will do anything in her power, etc. etc., she can't even be fucking bothered to know what illness I *actually* have.  Way to show your dedication...\n\nShe emailed me a few days after I had my interview about possible further treatment, saying: \"I hope your appointment went won Tuesday, and that you have a plan for meeting your goals. Again let me know if there is anything I can do to help.\"\n\nI know it's petty, but she seems to never take the time to proof-read her emails, so I get plenty of typos and mistakes - they make me feel like I'm not worth the bother of a correct spelling, let alone a correct illness.\n\nI haven't replied, since she didn't ask a direct question - she never does that, she just assumes, insinuates, and infers.  I've told her a thousand times that *if* there's anything I need her help with, I'll ask.  I've never done that, so I assume her asking is for her own benefit in some way.\n\nSo yeah, my own mother, who purports to love me *so* much, and wants to do everything, and be everything, didn't even get my diagnosis straight.  \n\nWay to make me feel like I matter.\n\n**tl;dr: my mother didn't even put in the effort to know what diagnosis I have**\n\n\n\n","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","link_flair_css_class":"lo","is_self":true,"secure_media":null,"quarantine":false,"thumbnail":"self","from_kind":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1450623345,"hide_score":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/3uxond/my_mother_and_the_ultimate_invalidation/","secure_media_embed":{},"permalink":"/r/BPD/comments/3uxond/my_mother_and_the_ultimate_invalidation/","gilded":0,"media_embed":{},"locked":false,"distinguished":null}

Well tonight I got a message from someone who lived just 5 minutes away, he was a year younger than me which perked my interest. I'm 22 and usually you only get older guys, which I like too but I felt more comfortable starting out with someone around the same age.\n\nAnyway we only sent about 5-6 messages back and forth but we agreed to meet up and drive to a secluded spot so I could suck him off in his car. He was a bigger guy, I could tell right away he played football or something. On the way there we had a bit of small talk but nothing much, as soon as we found a spot he leaned back and just took his cock out.\n\nBeing the good Sissy I am I got straight to work, after a few minutes of me worshipping his cock with my tounge he said \"Got a lotta practice huh?\" that made me feel really good, i'v only sucked off one guy before and it was more than a year ago. Practicising with toys really does make perfect.\n\nI was just having the time of my life sucking his cock, he would occasionally put his hand on the back of my head and force me all the way down but if I ever gagged or anything he would immediately lay off. It was really hot, him telling me to suck his cock and suck that hot cum right out. I sucked him off for about an hour actually before he finally came, I was used to maybe 5-10 minutes so this was a real sissy workout. \n\nFinally he grabbed his cock and told me he was cumming, asking if I could handle his big load. And oh man he was not kidding, he shot a good few spurts into my mouth until he was done. I really wish I had been on my knees because some of it dripped out before I could swallow. After I played with his cum for a couple seconds I swallowed it all and we drove back. \n\nI literally just walked in the door and felt like wrighting out what happened because i'm still a little shaky. I was super nervous before hand but as soon as I got in the car all my nerves dissapeared. I just can't believe I really did it, it actually feels amazing. \n\nSo just wanted to say don't be shy!

I'm 19 now, and I've been dealing with for probably the entirety of my adolescence, but I was only just diagnosed after a full assessment. I have bipolar disorder type 1, or 'bipolar depression with psychotic features'. I haven't been placed on a proper mood stabilizer yet. \n\nUnlike a lot of the people here, I don't think I'm struggling with anything that's very stressful. I'm in a depressive episode, and I'm completely sane (in case my diagnosis made you think otherwise). However, I'm really very tired of struggling through every day, and I think to myself quite frequently that I really don't know if I can do this for much longer. \n\nMy bipolar disorder doesn't present in the way that the common imagination (obviously, because many people don't understand what bipolar is) or even many bipolar patients would express it. Some people have described their moods as feeling like a battle between god and the devil (the band Brand New named an album after a phrase some used to describe their bipolar accordingly), and many people talk about how they crave the (hypo)mania (especially bipolar type 2 individuals). For myself, however, I have clinically severe mania with little euphoric content, and it's characterized more than anything by extreme agitation/irritability and hypersensitivity as well as psychotic symptoms in extreme cases. I've had bad grandiose delusions as well as severe persecutory delusions which lasted months. I can become obsessed with ideas or people and become extremely driven, and I'm extremely sensitive to anything which gets in my way or annoys me, or I can simply be extremely irritable. I don't get increased productivity - I get increased desire to be productive and accomplish things, but so many thoughts and so much of a mess in my head that I can't actually accomplish anything and I feel like I'm having a daily mental breakdown. It's an absolute horror, and while I should note that I've never been violent or any of the more negative imagery this description might suggest, I'm an extreme, strung-out asshole during these periods. I've lost many friends during these times, and I just generally can't really properly function. And they last a couple of months (3 or 4 usually) and then end, and everything that happened looks so absurd. I want so badly to apologize after the episodes and even during them for how I act, but I know it will look insincere, which is very alienating.\n\nRight now I'm pretty seriously depressed, and I think it presents in a pretty typical manner. I feel extremely sluggish and without energy. I'm exhausted, extremely low, nothing makes me feel anything, and everything seems entirely hopeless and pointless. Usually when I'm depressed I have daily suicidal thoughts. However, I don't have psychotic symptoms when I'm depressed, so I have a much clearer mind. However, I feel like I'm completely outside of life. I have a group of people I interact with online daily, but I'm not close with any of them and I mostly just tangentially interact with them. Some of them compliment me and say I'm the funniest person in the group or that I'm hyper-intelligent, but I feel extremely bland and dumb, with nothing better to say to others than a few half-baked jokes. Maybe that's funny to them, but it's all I have to say, because I struggle to relate to people on a level beyond that. I don't struggle with social cues, and I can make small talk, but it feels like the vast majority of my inner self remains unexpressed, underneath a veneer of cheap wit or innocuous politeness or whatever. It's not even that I feel that I have to hide my mental illness like some depressed people (though that's part of it); I just feel that I'm an extremely introverted person and that my interests are quite divergent from everyone around me, and I really have no one to relate to because my temperament is so completely at odds with other people. Nothing against anyone for that. I don't feel superior. I just feel extremely alienated and alone. I'm in university, and I've made no friends there. A few acquaintances as always, but nothing beyond the superficial casual exchanges that everyone makes. And those are pleasant, but that's as deep as my interactions run. And I don't enjoy university much either. I don't really want to do it, but I feel that I have to. I struggle to keep up with it, and I'm missing many classes, but my marks are fine. I've never struggled with marks, so that's not the problem. Again, no real stressors.\n\nI've had a couple of very brief relationships, but nothing really substantive or long. The people I've loved haven't really felt the same way, and I've never met anybody that was a good fit for me. It's incredibly isolating, because I live in an extremely cold and detached inner world where I feel as if I'm more coasting along through life. It's like I'm not even a part of life, just a particularly unwell observer of it. Even in the extremely unlikely instance of me finding someone who would be good as a partner or even just friends who would be good to interact with, I probably can't share my illness with them. Nobody will really understand it. Maybe some of them can process depression, or at least be sympathetic. I'm sure some people can. However, my psychosis and mania, even though I've never been dangerous, is something other people will likely never accept about me. All my friends who have ostensibly claimed to support mental health have mocked people with psychosis or people who were 'crazy' without realizing what I've been through. It seems to be the nature of my illness that even if I find good people, I can never really connect to them at all, like I'm fundamentally isolated from other people. And even if someone were somehow to accept me, my depression makes interacting so difficult to enjoy, and my mania makes relationships falling apart so likely. \n\nAnd so that's essentially where I find myself. No stressful event to blame, no romantic struggle with my illness, and no illusions about other people being to blame for my issues. I don't have much hope, because I fail to see much point to my continued existence beyond the useless and condescending platitudes about some abstract Hope with a capital H that I should have for some reason that others can never seem to ground in anything practical, because it's nothing more than a convenient abstraction with no grounding in reality. I don't begrudge others for believing in hope. I can see why others would, and it's perfectly rational for them. For me personally, I can't see any reason for it. The world's a nice and meaningful place for others, and I don't think they're wrong for feeling that. I'm just not feeling it. I'm just a tired kid who doesn't think he can do this much longer.","domain":"self.SuicideWatch"}

The search was unsuccessful and all I had were a couple of temporary jobs, a bunch of interviews that I didn't get a reply for, and a whole ton of resumes that I've sent to some sort of black hole. Yesterday was the worst I've ever felt. I don't have enough money to pay for the next two months of my rent. I thought that I got a break after getting a seasonal job at UPS, but after signing the contract and even getting a uniform, I didn't receive a call. Last night I basically cried myself to sleep, while repeatedly muttering \"It's not gonna get worse\". And there are so many different emotions roaring around in my head. I feel angry, because so many times I'd get a follow-up question for my resume, only to get a silent treatment again after I respond. I feel ashamed, because all of my friends are already employed. I feel scared, because I don't know what's going to happen. I was contemplating suicide for some time, but the thing is, I want to live. I want to start yearning money, I want to make my mom proud, I want to have fun with my friends, I want to play more games, I want to watch more anime, I want to do so many things!

This is gonna be long [I'll **tl;dr** along the way] and I already feel guilty about that because these problems seem very solvable but I just can't seem to figure anything out.\n\nI guess I'll start with school. I've always had difficulties with motivating myself. I graduated high school with a 1.7 GPA and skipped what should have been my first semester of college to accomplish nothing. The following semester I went to community college and took 5 classes. While I did manage to get a 3.2 GPA that semester, two of the classes I took aren't transferable and were only required because I fucked up my placement tests. This semester, I only took 3 classes to make sure I could succeed comfortably and I'll *still* wind up flunking 2, maybe 3, of my classes. \n\ntl;dr\n**How can I learn to care about my school work? I feel like I'm behind and will never succeed.**\n\nAnother problem for me is that I am currently addicted to marijuana. I started smoking before this semester (which is a factor to my school struggles but not the source) and smoke daily now. I find that marijuana helps me with many things that I can't find solutions for elsewhere: I've had anxiety-induced insomnia since childhood and can't sleep with sleeping medication. I can after a bowl. I hate myself sober and can't see any redeeming qualities. I like myself a little more after a bowl. Without sleep and self-esteem, I find it hard to function. Weed helps me attain both but still is more a distraction than anything. \n\ntl;dr **If I quit marijuana, I think I'd have more control over my life but would be unhappier. I already think of suicide regularly and fear the self-hate that comes with sobriety.**\n\nThe last problem I would love advice for is my social life. I struggle with initiating conversation but can otherwise be quite sociable. The friends that I had in high school seem less and less compatible nowadays due to different interests (They like playing competitive sports and I'm 5'3 so people get mad at me often/pick me last.) The few friends that I do have now only want to smoke with me and say that my expectations of people are too high. I don't trust my self-assessment enough to disagree so I'll assume that I'm an asshole.\n\ntl;dr **I don't really know where I belong anymore and it's been lonely.**\n\nSo again, sorry for making this post so long and thanks for bearing with me.

Called me in tears, totally embarrassed about the neighbours seeing that (which I understand), confused about what was going on, plus the repo guy basically yelled at her in the driveway when she asked him what was going on, etc (which, again, I understand - I'm sure they deal with people lying to them and raging at them all day). \n\nI handle most of her finances for her with the exception of this ONE thing because it was always just set up for automatic withdrawal and never an issue so this was totally off my radar. Now after speaking with the bank, and them acknowledging that the 2 day \"gap\" was the issue, among other things, they're still saying that she's on the hook for the towing costs, processing fees, etc, etc, and it will be at least 48 hours before the recovery company even contacts her about it. \n\nTo make matters even worse she lives in a rural area and literally can't even get to a store to buy basic things without having a vehicle.\n\nI just feel sick and would appreciate it if someone could help me put this in perspective. I'd like to hear how other (adults) cope with having an older parent who needs more assistance than they can give sometimes. Also, if anyone is familiar with how the repo process works (we're in Canada BTW) I'd like to hear what kinds of fees we can expect to be on the hook for and if it's worth me speaking to a legal aid lawyer to get them waived since technically the bank should have cancelled the whole thing last week.\n\nUsing a throwaway b/c some real-life friends know my reddit username.\n\nThanks.\n\n**EDIT**: Just thought I'd come back and update this, just because. Spoke to a lawyer today (nothing formal, a friend of mine works at a big law firm that handles stuff like this so I called in a favour). \n\nShe basically told me that it's very clear, given all the documentation my mom has, the info the bank provided, etc, that this was the banks error. The car should be immediately returned to my mom (as in she shouldn't even have to go pick it up) with no fees. Waiting for a call back from the person it got escalated to at the bank.\n\nFingers crossed.","domain":"self.SeriousConversation","author_flair_text":null,"downs":0,"num_comments":13,"title":"I'm 36, male, and today my 68 year old mothers car got repossessed.

Totally new here so please forgive me if this is stupid or in the wrong place.\n\nMy mom and dad had me when they were 15 and 19. \n\nMom left, and dad \"raised\" me with the help of my grandparents (his parents). Later on I was raised solely by them and they did everything for me, becoming my parents. \n\nDad never wanted me around, was always more concerned with the latest booty to chase, and was too concerned with that to care for me.\n\nI had to go stay with my mom every weekend, and she is a crazy woman and I'm surprised I'm not dead or worse than I am emotionally.\n\nAnyhow, I'm mainly here because of my dad. I'm needing some advice on how to deal with him and his new wife (who's a counselor and coddles his behavior).\n\nAs a kid when I actually lived with him for a bit (he lived directly across the street from my grandparents) he would do the whole terrible parenting where he would tell me I was a brat and I was spoiled because of my grandparents, and I was a smart ass, and I would have to write sentences if I was bad, or would have to watch jesus films and \"think about what jesus would do.\" \n\nI distinctly remember once when I went to the dentist and they put me under the numbing gas to fill a cavity, I told the dentist that I had to pee and I wasn't going to make it. They didn't listen so I peed in my pants (I was about 7). I was so embarrassed and my dad came into the room and threw a bitch fit over me pissing in my pants and told me that I was going to get my ass worn out when I got home. When we got home he spanked me with a belt, along with embarrassing me in the dentist's office, all over an accident. It was in that moment I realized how much I hated him, but yet I still wanted him to love me and want me. And of course, \"that never happened\" is his typical response to me.\n\nAs I got older I remember only wanting to be around him and he didn't want anything to do with me, he dated a meth head who would verbally abuse me as well (which he actually took up for me on most occasions.)\n\nAnyways, I say all that to say that now I'm 25 and have started to realize that I can't stand him. I don't want anything to do with him, and he can't seem to understand that.\n\nLong story short is, I'm married, he is mad because he can't control me anymore, has never done anything to support me or be a father to me, and now wants to be my father so he can have the control and look good in front of everyone.\n\nI recently started to understand that he has a lot of traits of the narcissist, and started researching it a bit more.\n\nI told him after the last fallout we had that I didn't want to be in his life anymore and I was done being controlled by him and my husband had to step in and reinforce those boundaries.\n\nI shared an article the other day about not feeling bad by not talking to toxic parents, and lo and behold someone has shown this to my dads wife and of course she decides to message me and tell me :\n\n\"you're mean and need Jesus\" in a nutshell. \nand to \"quit being passive aggressive\"\n\nI can't help but laugh my ass off at this.\n\nThis is the second time she has done childish shit like this over social media regarding what I post or pin. The first time was on pinterest when I first started reading up on narcissistic parents and pinning blogs to read on the subject, she basically told me \"it takes one to know one\" as a comment on one of the images i pinned....\n\nSo, I blocked her. Blocked her from being able to see anything of mine on facebook as well, so this is where I'm at.\n\nHow do I deal with this? My plan is to just ignore her but family events are going to be difficult. \n\nAlso, total side note....do your Nparents obsess over sports (or anything) and get pissed for weeks when they lose and if you come against that in any form or fashion you're a terrible person? I didn't know if that's a narcissistic tendency or if that's just because people are weird. My dad gets this way all the time, and even forces people to do things they don't want to do and gets mad when they disagree.\n\nAnyways, sorry for the rambles. Please be nice, total newb and don't know where to start!

{"author":"potatogod91","over_18":false,"edited":1448937322,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"author_flair_text":null,"selftext":"I'm 24  years old. So, since I started the process of coming out a few months back, I've been dealing with a slew of emotional upheavals, going from one crush to another and getting over it, and lately developing a crush on a 27 year old gay friend/study buddy of mine at school who's been keeping a close eye on me and been very caring. I've had my local gaybros group give input (I gave them all the details) because I needed a fresh pair of eyes on this, and the consensus is that either my crush is into me (he mentioned rather ambiguously that he liked me), or he's now a close platonic friend (which came by pretty fast). In order to deal with this, as well as continue the process of coming out and process my emotions, I need to do the following:\n\n1) I'm basically done with sowing my oats. I've done it for six years with plenty of guys and while I won't exclude it, I'm getting tired of hooking up. I'm starting to get more and more unsatisfied busting my rocks off with someone I don't even know and won't see again.\n\n2) There were plenty of times lately where I went to some place alone and I kept thinking it would be nice to share my experiences with someone. I have a limited emotional support network since I moved across the country from my family. A boyfriend might solve this issue.\n\n3) Owing to the stress of my school year, my friend advised me NOT to come out to my parents yet, but also strongly advised me against me advancing too far into the scene before I tell my parents. I can't tell them until next December, which is a year, and waiting a full year is unacceptable.\n\n4) I've started dating guys, but I'm remaining non-committal unless I REALLY hit it off with someone (which is how it should be).\n\n5) It seems like there are nuances with me and my friend talking, and we're both missing the mark on the meaning of what the other says. I've come to realize that socializing with gay guys can be different from socializing with straight guys because there are some meanings and nuances that fly right past the head of straight people. I already know vocabulary such as twink, shade, yass, etc, and I'm beginning to realize that I've exchanged the \"gay stare\" or a \"knowing look\" with other gay guys without realizing it.\n\nExample: I inadvertently sounded really bitter over one project partner years before and made him sound like an ex, and my friend (we were talking in public) asked me, \"Was he a **friend**?\" I looked at him and I said, \"What?\" \"Is he a **friend**?\" I looked down and said, \"He said he liked me and was bewildered I didn't like him back, and that was because I saw him as untrustworthy.\" Well, \"like\" can be a loaded term.\n\n6) To fix these problems, learn how to talk to guys (and take cues over whether they might be interested or not), and learn how to socialize with gay guys, I'm continuing to hang out with my local gaybros group. They're a decent group of people, and I need to make gay friends for my own development. I'm also going to gay bars and clubs.\n\n7) I've blockaded and fell off the radar repeatedly from my friend, whom I wound up developing a crush on because we hit it off well and had a lot in common. It's only going to frustrate him and piss him off. So, I'm undoing it and continuing to hang out and study with him and see what develops. \n\n8) I've already taken concrete steps towards looking and feeling better, such as starting to lift weight, get more fit and exit the twink stage, paying more attention to skincare, buying new cologne and changing my hairstyle. People are noticing the difference. \n\n9) I am NOT telling my friend I have a crush on him because I don't want to scare him off and I'm too dependent on him for support. At the same time, I don't want to outright friendzone him either and completely exclude him from the possibility of a relationship. So, what I'm doing is I'll present to him my plan as well as tell him I'm done sowing my oats, mention I'm going on dates with different guys (including ones who happen to be the same type as my friend is), and continue to hang out with him. If he and I get closer and something develops, that's fine.\n\n\ntl;dr: I'm sick and tired of hookups, plan is to socialize with gay guys, insert myself into the scene, make new gay friends, start dating, find a boyfriend, and deal with my gay friend/study buddy/crush accordingly. Not friendzoning him, but not telling him I have a crush either because I'm too dependent on him for support.","domain":"self.askgaybros","subreddit_id":"t5_2vgfw","link_flair_css_class":null,"from":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"3uxu0p","name":"t3_3uxu0p","subreddit":"askgaybros","num_comments":3,"title":"My plan for the process of coming out (since I started a few months back)- input appreciated.","downs":0,"media":null,"created_utc":1448935378,"score":6,"saved":false,"stickied":false,"ups":6,"permalink":"/r/askgaybros/comments/3uxu0p/my_plan_for_the_process_of_coming_out_since_i/","gilded":0,"hide_score":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/3uxu0p/my_plan_for_the_process_of_coming_out_since_i/","media_embed":{},"locked":false,"distinguished":null,"secure_media":null,"is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","quarantine":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1450623275,"from_kind":null}

I actually smoked before I drank, but it was in the same timeframe.  After that, I tried LSD for the first time at 20, then did shrooms for the first time of 21. When I turned 23 I had done DMT, MDMA, cocaine, and some RCs. I dabbled in psychedelics here and there while I was on probation and couldn't smoke weed. I got off probation last year, started smoking weed again. I then later had a Xanax but that is as hard as it goes. I'm 26 now, and up until recent, I have never had an opiate, ever. I have a few friends that have been addicted to opiates, and I think they are really awesome people. So I really wanted to test it to see what the hype was about. The crazy commercials about heroin/pills users were inaccurate. So I had to investigate myself. \n\nI decided to try heroin. I ended up getting gray powdered dope for $30 a point. I met up with my guy and got two points of this shit. I copped Thanksgiving night. I ended up doing a small bump (a small yet unmeasured dose) that night. It was pretty enjoyable. I continued Friday and Saturday using about 2 bumps once or twice a day. Not too much of an effect, but enough to get a feeling. \n\nThe last time I used was last night (Sunday) with a sitter. I hadn't had it since Saturday evening. I did about 5 small bumps off my key this time, which is more than I've done, and I got REALLY high. I actually REALLY enjoyed it. It felt like there was an orgasm all over my body. The legs are fucking awesome too. Part of me enjoys the slow legs more than the rush that goes away pretty quickly. (Legs = the after effect that comes from the initial rush) Anyways, I remember enjoying it so much, so much to the point that I can see why people get addicted to this shit. It's AMAZING! \n\nSo here's the weird part and conclusion of my experiment; I still have a little bit left and I might as well finish it. However, the thought of doing it grosses me out and idk why because I really enjoy it. However, the abstract thought of doing some more heroin gives me a really queasy feeling.

I actually smoked before I drank, but it was in the same timeframe.  After that, I tried LSD for the first time at 20, then did shrooms for the first time of 21. When I turned 23 I had done DMT, MDMA, cocaine, and some RCs. I dabbled in psychedelics here and there while I was on probation and couldn't smoke weed. I got off probation last year, started smoking weed again. I then later had a Xanax but that is as hard as it goes. I'm 26 now, and up until recent, I have never had an opiate, ever. I have a few friends that have been addicted to opiates, and I think they are really awesome people. So I really wanted to test it to see what the hype was about. The crazy commercials about heroin/pills users were inaccurate. So I had to investigate myself. \n\nI decided to try heroin. I ended up getting gray powdered dope for $30 a point. I met up with my guy and got two points of this shit. I copped Thanksgiving night. I ended up doing a key bump that night. It was pretty enjoyable. I continued Friday and Saturday using about 2 bumps once or twice a day. Not too much of an effect, but enough to get a feeling. \n\nThe last time I used was last night (Sunday) with a sitter. I hadn't had it since Saturday evening. I did about 5 key bumps this time which is more than I usually do, and got REALLY high. I actually REALLY enjoyed it. It felt like there was an orgasm all over my body. The legs are fucking awesome too. Part of me enjoys the slow legs more than the rush that goes away pretty quickly. (Legs = the after effect that comes from the initial rush) Anyways, I remember enjoying it so much, so much to the point that I can see why people get addicted to this shit. It's AMAZING! \n\nSo here's the weird part and conclusion of my experiment; I still have a little bit left and I might as well finish it. However, the thought of doing it grosses me out and idk why because I really enjoy it. However, the abstract thought of doing some more heroin gives me a really queasy feeling.

He was past 70 and retired a few months later, so I haven't been able to go to him for a follow-up, nor can any insurance agencies.

I have put off college for 3.5 years because I was working full time to pay for a car payment. In the last month I've decided to go back to school. I've told everyone and they're really excited for me. But last week I was in a car accident and the car was totaled, meaning no more payments. This puts me back in the same situation I was in before I bought my car; take an epic trip, or progress in life. I'm 21 now, and I've been with my girlfriend for 5 years, since 11th grade. Her parents want the best for me and love me, and her and her family mean more to me than anyone. That said I feel guilty about putting school off again to do the AT. My girlfriend graduates in May, and I feel like her parents want me to get my life going now. I'm not sure what they think though for sure, I haven't asked. Honestly I'm scared to. When I told my girlfriend she wasn't supportive at all, but apologized a few days later for what she said and said she'd support it. I literally have no friends close enpugh to talk to about this.\n\nI don't have much time to decide either. Payment for school is due in 2-3 weeks, and I have no form of transportation until my insurance pays my car. If I do this I'll start Northbound in mid-January so I can be done in time for school in Fall 2016. I understand I should do what makes me happy, but I can't do it without the support of the people that I care about most. \n\nThe other small issue I have is money, but I'll get my tax return mid Feb. probably over $1k and I can probably save up about another $1k or more until I leave. Other than that I'll probably be relying on packages from family. If I leave then, will I run into any issues other than snow and winter weather? I have ALL gear I need minus a way to charge my phone. Any suggestions? \n\nIs anyone else in the same boat? How do you make this decision. I've flip flopped a dozen times over the last week, where I say I'm buying a car and doing probably the more simple and responsible thing, then saying I'm gonna do what I've wanted for years. I just cant decide. It sucks and I'm completely torn.","author_flair_text":null}
