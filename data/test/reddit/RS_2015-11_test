I am tired of always being tired and not having the energy to do anything. \nOne of my best friends has been on the Keto diet for a few months and has lot a good amount of weight so far! When she was first telling me about this diet I thought she was crazy. No pasta and no bread \u2013 NOOOOOoooooo. After eating dinner with her the other night and seeing her progress I was inspired and started doing some more research into the Keto diet. \nSo I decided to buckle down and look up recipes and put together some food list that I will eat. I just went out with the said best friend and have bought essentials that I have found in all recipes. My biggest problem is that I am super and when I said super I mean SUPER picky. I don\u2019t eat any veggies, fruit, salad, etc. Basically, I eat a lot of pasta, chicken, potatoes, bread, pizza, and cheese. I am worried that after a week or so I will be bored and will go back to drinking my much beloved Mellow Yellows and eating pasta and pizza the majority of the time. \nI have a few people that I know will be super supportive, but most of my co-workers/friends won\u2019t be when/ if they find out I am on a diet. The last few diets I have went on I\u2019ve stopped because I lost faith due to their (mainly one girl who is a friend of mine) comments and attitude to my diet/success. \nDoes anyone have any good advice on recipes to ease the transition to the Keto diet for the picky eaters like myself? \n","from_id":null,"gilded":0,"locked":false,"retrieved_on":1450692655,"from":null,"archived":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rske","name":"t3_3r1051","secure_media_embed":{},"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"keto","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":"1446336345","created":1446365145,"edited":1446339720,"media":null,"num_comments":7,"downs":0,"quarantine":false,"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_text":null,"hide_score":false,"is_self":true,"title":"New to Keto -- picky eater","id":"3r1051","secure_media":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.keto"}

I mostly like simulation games like Cities:Skylines, Age of Empires, Tropico, Kerbal Space Program etc. I also like to play other genres such as RPG and FPS. Right now, I'm trying to finish The Witcher 3 (I'm not even halfway done) before the Fallout 4 release.\n\nAnyway, I'm writing this post because I need your brutal and honest opinions. Recently, I've started a website (I won't say the name because I figured it would be against the rule to advertise) that sells mostly funny and and clever shirts for PC Gamers.\n\nI already have five designs. Here they are.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/Wv7bd\n\nNow, my questions are:\n\nFirst, **What do you think of my designs? Are they good? Bad?** I'm the one who designs them but I have to pay someone who is good at photoshop for it be printed.\n\nSecond, **How much would you be willing to pay for the shirts?** I don't really print the shirts myself. I rely on a fulfillment service. One shirt brand costs $16 so I'm gonna have to sell it for $18.95 Another brand costs $13 so I was able to bring the price down to $15.95 But of course, that would mean the shirt quality would be a little less better. Do you think that I could sell it for another price point?\n\nIf I could earn enough profit, I could buy the necessary equipments and print the shirts myself, then maybe I could make the price go even lower.\n\nThird **Would you even buy at all?** I honestly think my shirts are cool, but of course it would be pointless if nobody would actually waste time on a shirt for passionate PC gamers.\n\nThat's really all I need to know. I'm sorry for the long post. I really don't have anyone to validate what I created so knowing how helpful this community is, I figured I come here. I know how much you guys hate corporate people ripping you off of your hard earned money, that's why I came here with full honesty to get your feedbacks.

My personal favorite at the time was Mononoke Hime by studio Ghibli.\n\nSteve one day convinced me to watch The Evil Dead with him because he thought I'd like it, little did he know that I'm quite squeamish when it comes to gore, and that I'm (or at least was back then) extremely sensitive for atmosphere and emotions and stuff. As in still feeling uncomfortable for days after watching a heavy movie.\n\nOn top of that I have a very vivid imagination, and a very visual memory, which makes that when I try to sleep at night after watching even something a little gory for a split second, that's the only thing I can envision because of the impact it left on me.\n\nThus watching the Evil Dead was a bad idea, and even though I still watched it and even liked it to a certain extent (that sound design was ridiculously good and creative, as a musician I noticed that) it haunted me truly. As the title of this post states, I didn't sleep for days, I literally stayed awake 72 hours because not being able of feeling comfortable closing my eyes for too long.\n\nAs you can imagine I had a sincere aversion to horror from that point on, especially when I learned that The Evil Dead was supposed to be a funny horror movie... I couldn't imagine what a serious one would look like... (That girl being raped by that tree was apparently supposed to be a hilarious commentary on horror tropes? I took it for what it was and was terrified by it)\n\nBetween then and now (I'm 22 now) I only watched one other horror movie, the original Nightmare On Elm Street. This because at a Halloween get together with some friends including Steve, Steve proposed watching that because it was a classic, and I gave in to peer pressure.\n\nI liked the movie but had the same problem of feeling haunted for days even though ironically enough I was able to sleep this time.\n\nNow about 6 years after that halloween, I watched my first Horror movie by myself in a dark room on headphones, and I'm so fucking thrilled.\n\nCabin In The Woods is a master piece in my eyes, it's hilariously funny, Joss Whedon's dialogues are out of this world, and the commentary it delivers on the overdone tropes in horror is just outright genius. \n\nI'm not sure I'll be watching a lot of horror movies in the future, but I'm definitely over my complete and utter aversion to them.\n\nI just wished to share this minor personal milestone with a community that might relate to-, or at least understand it.\n\nCheers /r/movies, you guys are awesome.\n\n_____________\n\n*Edit:* to clarify why I know what the typical horror tropes are while not watching horror movies... Although I might be too afraid of horror movies to watch them directly, I still enjoy watching commentaries and reviews of them.

I am 61 years old and I live in a small two-bedroom apartment in Wisconsin with my 82 year old mother. My daughter and two grandchildren became homeless in the past couple of days when she was forced to leave her abusive boyfriend. She has struggled with making ends meet and his income has mostly supported them. Unfortunately the situation escalated in the past couple of days and she was kicked out of her home with the children and barely any belongings. I have pleaded with her to go to the police so they can help her but she refuses to do so. She has threatened to leave him before but he would never let her so she just accepted it and decided to stay because of the money and bill situation.\n\nShe is taking this as her way out, even if she has to start over with nothing. The problem now is that she has to stay in my apartment which means my two person household has turned into five. I am on disability and make about $600 a month. My mother collects Social Security benefits for about $800 and her pension is $81 a month. In the end we make about $1,500 a month and our rent is $765. After monthly prescriptions (about 20 in total), gas/electric bill, household necessities, and other bills we end up having $65 extra a month. This doesn\u2019t include co-pays for doctor\u2019s visits that my mother has (I have a zero co-pay with my insurance for disability), gasoline for our vehicle, and other unexpected costs. My daughter has a joint-checking account with her boyfriend that kicked her out and he has withdrawn the funds of her most recent check so she won\u2019t have money for two weeks. When she does get her paycheck, she will have a lot to purchase since she now barely has any belongings for herself or my grandchildren ages 5 and 7.\n\nI receive $55 a month in food stamps and my mother receives $19 a month. We both received ours last week and it is all spent. I didn\u2019t foresee this situation occurring and having to take in my daughter and two small children. We barely have any food in the house that the children will eat since we are an adult household. Typically my daughter would bring some food over from her house when we would babysit so that the kids would have food. $74 total food stamps for us doesn\u2019t go far anyway as my mother can only eat certain foods that are expensive due to her health. My daughter cannot apply for food stamps because she cannot apply that she is living in my household due to the excessive head count and if she applies as homeless it can impact the children and custody.\n\nWe are now in such a bad situation from toilet paper, laundry detergent, pull-ups that my youngest grandchild uses due to urinary issues, and most importantly food. I am just beyond words on the situation and praying for a miracle. My daughter applied at many jobs in the past couple of days and does have an interview for next week for a job that would at least double her income (fingers crossed).\n\nI apologize for the lengthy post but even after all I have written I could say so much more. My daughter has a laptop because she is in school so luckily I am able to utilize it to write this. I have not had access to the internet in many months because of selling my personal laptop due to bills and my own struggles with a fixed income. The first thing my daughter wanted to do was sell her laptop for money this week but it is so old that she would maybe receive $50 for it and she can\u2019t because I will not let her drop out of school due to a horrible man! She might have to because food for the little ones is priority one but we are exhausting all other options first.\n\nThank you all for taking the time to read this and God bless to any that can possibly help! Amazon is SO expensive for items so the majority of items added are for Wal-Mart. Thank you for your time again! I know this is quite lengthy! Please feel free to ask any questions and thank you for your time.\n\nIf you cannot assist please just say a prayer or two for our family. It would be greatly appreciated.\n\nJayne\n\nhttps://www.walmart.com/lists/view-wish-list-items?id=cdac8b0a-88ec-48a3-8dd6-5833a011ba2c&amp;adid=1500000000000039380010&amp;veh=eml\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/4YVG2N85M136/ref=cm_sw_su_w\n","from_id":null,"gilded":0,"locked":false,"retrieved_on":1450692635,"from":null,"archived":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s25d","secure_media_embed":{},"name":"t3_3r11ny","permalink":"/r/Assistance/comments/3r11ny/please_help_i_have_taken_in_my_daughter_and/","ups":10,"over_18":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/3r11ny/please_help_i_have_taken_in_my_daughter_and/","score":10,"stickied":false,"saved":false,"link_flair_css_class":"request","author":"jjjcountry6","from_kind":null}

With this Master's program, I've already racked up a notable amount of student debt (~50k) and with the medical school tuition coming up soon, I am feeling very shaky and nervous in regards to my finances. I am the type of the person that hates any type of debt and will avoid accumulating debt as much as I can before finally giving in. (Thus, I don't have any undergrad debt.)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThis medical school costs ~32k per year for tuition so that's going to be at least ~128k for the whole 4 years, provided they don't change the tuition rate next year. I am working part-time right now, earning $16/hour pre-tax and work very minimally this semester due to the high intensity program, so my hours change depending on how busy I am each week. I pay for my car, my rent, and my living expenses (and tuition but that's from my loans). \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere's what everything boils down to:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nMy current money/income:\n\n\n* ~$1k left in savings (due to my cut down of hours these past weeks, I've had to take money out of my savings to pay for rent.)\n\n\n* $700 in bank\n\n\n* $400-700 of income biweekly (predicted to increase next semester to $800-1000)\n\n\n* $3k from loans coming in January for next semester\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nMy spending:\n\n\n* $600/mo for rent\n\n\n* $234/mo for car (this was originally purchased by my dad, and he promised to pay for it all but he's in a LOT of debt, so I've been paying to avoid burdening him. The car will be fully paid off in 2 years.) \n\n\n* $100/mo for living expenses (gas, food, Netflix--shared with my family)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nTotal Loans: ~50k for Masters + ~128k for MD = ~178k total (hopefully?)\n\n\nInterest rate: 6.3%\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nJust to help me calm down, I would really like to know what steps I should do to help with my loans later? The interest rate is really turning me off at 6.3% and I'm not sure what's the best option to pay them off later and when I should start paying them. How do I pay and how do I (reasonably) avoid the most interest accumulated? Approximately how long will it take for me to finish paying off the debt? I will mostly likely be getting underpaid horribly during residency program so not sure how much that's going to help with my loans...\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nPlease forgive me if something does not sound coherent, I'm lacking a lot of sleep so feel free to correct me.

Yesterday I was promoted from \"Senior Product Support Analyst\", a mostly internal title without many industry analogues, to \"Lead Data Analyst\" a weighty sounding title (to me) that accurately captures the work and management responsibilities I've taken on. I was making $78k/year (salary), which was increased to $85k/year with this promotion - a ~9% raise. \n\n**Generic Company Background:** Very successful tech firm in the adult industry. Highly profitable, about 250 employees, located in the Pacific Northwest. It's a private company with profit sharing bonuses twice a year and an insanely awesome 401k and I see myself staying at this company for the long haul. (My last bonus was ~16k gross, this next one will be even bigger due to new title).\n\n**Some Personal Background:** I was originally hired on as a graphic designer making 47k/year and have gradually worked my way up through various positions and skillsets to my current position. This company treats me and other employees **very** well. \n\n**The \"Rub\":** When my manager gave me the good news, I was so thrilled. It wasn't a complete surprise - I was being evaluated for promotion for about 4-5 months prior to yesterday. I was hoping for a bit larger of a raise given that technically I'm now part of the management team, but with bonuses, I'm now earning well into the 6 figures. The weird part of all this is that my manager called out how much more I'm making now than when I started, which felt slightly manipulative because I feel as though I've worked my ass off to get my way here and have been compensated mostly fairly. When he told me my new salary, I didn't negotiate because I was so happy about the promotion. \n\n**The Question:** Am I being an ungrateful brat? I feel very lucky to work at a company that's paying me well, but I've never really negotiated salary - have just taken what they've given and been content because I can pay my bills and save and invest just fine. I wanted to share these details with a community that knows what they're talking about to either get some sense knocked into me or to help me develop a strategy for negotiating for more.\n\n**Thank you very much for your time - I'm happy to answer any/all questions.**\n\nEdit: Glassdoor says the national average for my position is $93.3k/year, but the regional average for \"Senior\" data analyst (one tier below my title) is $95.9k/year. \n\nEdit2: If it's helpful, I'm 30 and this is my first \"real\" job.\n\nEdit3: Thanks all for your feedback. I feel a lot happier having asked the questions and received your feedback. I think I'm going to \"focus on the fact that this company is investing in (me) and supporting (my) career growth\" (- mikejc) and keep doing good work.","author_flair_text":null,"name":"t3_3r15na","secure_media_embed":{},"subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","archived":false,"from":null,"retrieved_on":1450692584,"locked":false,"gilded":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"personalfinance","media_embed":{},"media":null,"edited":1446343196,"created":1446368029,"created_utc":"1446339229","thumbnail":"self","link_flair_text":"Employment","quarantine":false,"downs":0,"num_comments":21,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.personalfinance","secure_media":null,"title":"\"Big\" promotion with minimal raise - Seeking Feedback","id":"3r15na","is_self":true,"hide_score":false}

{"selftext":"Please be kind, this is very hard for me.\n\nI am 43 years old - I've been a single parent to my nearly 8 year old son since he was 6 months old. His Dad is not around. We do okay - I have my own business &amp; am also studying to further my career, I make ends meet and do everything on my own but I'm certainly not well off. We are very happy.\n\nI haven't dated much in the past 7 years since my marriage ended as my focus has been on my son. However a couple of months ago I met a guy who appealed to me. Professional, mature, one 8yo daughter of his own, we have a lot in common. He's less than a year out of a very long (over 10 year) marriage so we took things slowly. We've been seeing each other once a week (only on my one child-free night a week) for 2 months now. Things are lovely, friendly and positive with him. That said, in my heart I've thought for a while that he's not really ready for a relationship beyond what we have now - but that's okay, dating casually and having a companion has been working well. Our kids aren't involved. We haven't met friends or anything like that. I think we've both been just seeing how things go as we are both a little gun-shy from past relationship issues.\n\nYesterday I realised my period was a week late. Did a pregnancy test. Positive. This morning I saw a Dr - another urine test, positive again. Dr is certain it's accurate and not a false positive caused by perimenopause. Blood test will be tomorrow to confirm but there's little doubt. No, I'm not on birth control (it doesn't work well for me and I've been single a long time); yes, we were using condoms the couple of times we had sex.\n\nI don't want another child. I've known that for some time now. I know the guy I'm dating doesn't want another child. We had that conversation, were happy we were both on the same page. So I plan to terminate, and will make an appointment tomorrow. It will likely be a medical termination (pills) to induce miscarriage. It's an easy decision for me to make but by no means one that will be easy to go through with. It's just that having another child now, at this age, in my current circumstances, with someone I hardly know, is not an option - even though it breaks my heart.\n\nMy question is: Should I tell him about it?\n\nNow, I know that telling him is probably the right thing to do in most circumstances. I'm not afraid to do so, I'm not trying to avoid that. However, if I'm 100% sure about termination and I am 90% sure he would support that choice - does he need to know? Would most men want to know or would they rather not? I don't need his help or support - a close friend knows, and she will stand by me. I don't need his help financially. I don't expect anything from him if I DO tell him other than for him to treat me respectfully about it, which I feel he would. \n\nI know our relationship is over at this point - whether I tell him or not there's no way I can face him after this, it would be too hard. And I believe he would be mature and reasonable about it, so I'm not afraid of his reaction. I guess I just wonder if it's kinder to just do this on my own, and quietly break up with him; or should I just tell him and let the cards fall where they may?\n\nAnd further to that - is email an acceptable way to tell him, so I can provide a copy of the results to remove any doubt he may reasonably have? I just don't think I could get through a call without falling apart - and I won't have kid-free time when he's not working in the next few days to meet him in person, and obviously if I tell him it needs to happen soon as I call the clinic tomorrow. Please help me to decide by sharing your thoughts, thanks so much.\n\n**EDIT TO ADD:** Of course if I intended to keep seeing him I'd tell him. No doubt. But my choice is: Tell him and see how it plays out (but I think it's probably too big an issue too early in a relationship for the relationship to survive, given that he's already on the fence about being ready for a relationship again just yet); or break up with him and not tell him. \n\n**EDIT 2:** I told him. I actually sent a text message to ask for his email address so then I could decide which way to tell him later tonight when my son is in bed. He asked me what I intended to send, as his only email address is for his work (he's a teacher) and it's monitored. I told him it's personal so that I'd probably just call him later instead, and asked him when he'd be at home. Then he flat out asked \"You're not pregnant?\"\n\nSo... I had to respond. I couldn't call as he's with his daughter today. So I told him that this isn't the way I wanted to tell him, but he'd put me on the spot. And yes, I'm pregnant but for me the choice is easy and I plan to terminate. Then said that he could call me later tonight if he wanted to.\n\nHe responded: \"Probably, like you, I feel a big hammer has just hit me. Firstly, sorry to have caused this. Secondly, I agree with your decision. For me it is also an easy decision but I am reliant on you looking at things in a similar way.\"\n\nThen a few minutes later: \"I feel sick in the stomach that I've caused this to happen. I'm so sorry to put you through this.\"\n\nI wrote back to say: \"I'm sorry to ruin your day, I thought about not telling you but I don't think I could live with that. I saw Dr this morning to confirm and got referral to a clinic to make appointment tomorrow. I'm 100% sure termination is the only choice &amp; I'm relieved you agree. That said, I'm terrified and very sad. Your support would be appreciated as I don't plan to tell anyone else about this.\"\n\nHis response: \"Of course you have my support, it's 200% the right thing to do...\" then went on to ask me some questions.\n\nSo I'm relieved that it's done, and thankful for his mature and supportive reaction. I appreciate your help in deciding Reddit, I really do think it was the right thing to do. Thank you x\n\n**EDIT 3:** I just got off the phone with him. We talked a little, I answered some questions. Then he told me \"As far as I can tell, you have three concerns: How I would react to your choice to terminate; how the whole termination process will go; and how I will feel about you after it's all done. So you can cross two of them off your list - I am completely supportive of the choice, and as far as I'm concerned the only thing this changes is that sometime in the next week or so you take some pills and need my support while you go through what happens after. Nothing else changes between us.\" Really, that's more than I'd expected. Then the rest of the hour long conversation was just an everyday talk about movies and life experiences - the regular chat you you'd expect between two people still getting to know each other. He also told me he would take time off work when I have to have an appointment at the clinic (even though he just got a promotion and begins his new role as Deputy Principal this week), and he also told me that even though he knows I will object he wants to pay for everything.\n\nI guess I'm just updating this because - this is a crappy situation, but this is probably a best case scenario for how we could both be dealing with it under the circumstances. I respect him a lot more because he's handled it far better than I thought he would - and I thanked him for that - and I guess it's nice to share a more positive story here for anyone in future who may search Reddit for this type of topic and stumble across my post. If anyone's interested I will do another update - though likely in a new post - after everything is said and done. Thank you again xx\n   \n**tl;dr**: Just found out I am 5 weeks pregnant to a man I've been casually dating for 2 months. I plan to terminate in the coming week &amp; I know he would support that choice. Should I tell him - or is it kinder not to? UPDATE: Told him, he responded better than expected and will support me through this.

I was oblivious to the real world and was more naive than the usual teenager. Just to give you an idea, I still have never had a girlfriend. I barely manage to maintain friendships, and I did not manage to lose my virginity until I was 20 almost 21. And it was almost like selling my soul to get to that point.

To this day(I am 23 working in another state now) , none of them think what they did was wrong and I was the worst daughter ever.

I feel like they will always believe I am the messed up child and ruined everything--so that is the thing that bothers me so much. It would be easier if they acknowledged the fact that I was hurt and what they did was wrong, but I don't want to live like this anymore, I want to some how be the better person and get over it--and try to have a relationship with boundaries. The  other problem is that they are religious Muslims and I do not follow a religion, so they really force Islam on me and want me to cover up and act Muslim, but that is totally against my own morals and that is not the life style I want to live. They are not wiling to compromise with religion for sure and I am not giving into a Islamic life style as a woman.

I am 19, she is 19, we have been together for 2.5 years, and we both live 15 minutes away from each other and attend universities about 20 minutes away from each other. She says she still loves me, and I still love her, but it has to be this way. Ive pleaded over and over again for her to take me back and us to love each other again, that she has now come to start ignoring my texts and treating me like filth. I don\u2019t know why she left me, because if you truly love someone, you would make time for them regardless of what is going on in your life. That person would make everything better. I am utterly, utterly, utterly destroyed. Everything inside of me is into little pieces that will not fix themselves. I have never been depressed in my life, let alone utterly, and utterly destroyed. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore, I feel like dying. The only reason im alive right now is because my mum is in a marriage where my dad had an affair for a month on her, and the only reason they are together is because of the lack of money. I love her so much that I couldn\u2019t ever dream of hurting her the slightest bit. I am just so sick of everything, and I am lost for words. This is my last hope to reach out to people for help, then im just stuck on my own, probably fall into a pit of depression that I will never get out.  I would never dream of killing myself, life is too valuable (i keep telling myself that life is valuable, but it\u2019s really not)\u2026 I just need help. Therapy is not an option. I will never touch therapy, even if I was given a 100 foot pole. I have barely any friends, I have no hobby, nothing i\u2019m good at, I can\u2019t work because im in school and too depressed. I am suppose to get my private pilot licence this summer, but the depression is making my grades fail, my desire to fly go away, and my desire to do anything. I have gone drinking, I have gone to my friends house and been very social, nothing has helped at all, only made it worse. I seriously need help. I have her on snapchat, instagram, facebook, I always look at her tumblr blog, I always look at her twitter updates, everything I do in my spare time is to do with her. I look at my pictures of her, I think of every little thing she did like massage the back of my head when I drive, or hold my thumb and put her feet up on the dashboard. I am dying inside, and I need someone to help me. Seriously help me. I will never find anyone who I connected with so well with. We had something that not even married people have. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, even if she was my first and only love and sexual experience.\n\n\ntl;dr my life is horrible right now","author_flair_text":null,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"from":null,"retrieved_on":1450692436,"locked":false,"gilded":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"name":"t3_3r1h26","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn"}

I cant even go into details about it. But, at age 21, I got help from college counselors to move in to emergency housing, local police even were informed about my home situation, and my family still tried to control me/find me after moving out in college. To this day(I am 23 working in another state now) , none of them think what they did was wrong and I was the worst daughter ever. They even further think that I am being oversensitive and that I did not go through any abuse or pain or I am making things up. They think it was all my fault that I ruined the family and moved away. \n\nI really want to forgive them and reconcile with them. I do not want to have bad feelings anymore, every time I try to talk to them, I am crying non-stop from beginning to the end. I do not know how to be strong and have a boundaries in our relationship. I still love them and I want to help them, but how do I let myself not let their words get in my head? I feel like they will always believe I am the messed up child and ruined everything--so that is the thing that bothers me so much. It would be easier if they acknowledged the fact that I was hurt and what they did was wrong, but I don't want to live like this anymore, I want to some how be the better person and get over it--and try to have a relationship with boundaries. The other problem is that they are religious Muslims and I do not follow a religion, so they really force Islam on me and want me to cover up and act Muslim, but that is totally against my own morals and that is not the life style I want to live. They are not wiling to compromise with religion for sure and I am not giving into a Islamic life style as a woman.

I'm 30 HL-F, married to 33 LL-M.  We have kids, though I'm not willing to use them as an excuse or blame for our issues, so I'm not going to go into age or how many, etc.  \n\nThings have been slowing down in the bedroom over past 5 years of marriage, to the point where it had been over 6 months since we had sex.  It's not even no sex, it's really no intimacy, just the pecks on the cheek and stiff hugs that I'd get from an acquaintance.\n\nI've suggested, mentioned, insisted.  He always agrees, but something just comes up.  Has to go to bed early for a stressful work day.  \"Can we do it later, I'm in the middle of (something)?\" \"sure thing hon, how about this weekend when I have some free time?\"  Of course when weekend rolls around, something else comes up.  \n\nIt's never an outright denial, just a slight of hand deflection.  He's very non-confrontational and the \"strong and silent\" type.  \n\nI've tried confronting and saying it's a big problem and I'm feeling unattractive and undesirable, and he'll listen patiently, ask why I feel that way, and insist he loves me, just things have been busy and stressful but he'll work on it.  And so I trust him to do it and another week turns into 2, and another month passes and wow nothing changes.\n\nUntil a few nights ago, I brought it up yet again, and when the patient \"sorry hon, you can tell me about how you feel ...\" I totally lost it, broke down, started crying hysterically.  I told him that I knew he didn't find me desirable anymore otherwise he would want to be intimate with me.  He just held me and listened as I sobbed and vented.  He didn't say anything about what he would do to fix it, just listened.\n\nThe next day (Friday) I got an email from him while he was at work (he must have typed it on his phone) basically apologizing for everything and also asking in pretty graphic terms if I was okay with certain things sexually.  Like being dominated and called dirty names.  Yes, yes, and yes, please!  He didn't mention anything else about it that evening, just watched TV, played with the kids, and went to bed. \n\nThis morning we both were off work and slept in.  I was awoken to him roughly kissing me and doing something to my neck.  When I came around, I realized he worked my shirt off, put the dog's collar around my neck and bound my hands with the metal chain leash.  He started manually stimulating me while biting my ear and saying wonderful things like \"is this what you wanted, you beautiful slut?  You wanted to be fucked like a whore?\"  God it was so hot, I climaxed twice, screaming and biting the blanket.\n\nI hope this made a lasting impression on him.  I know he really enjoyed it as well.  Also hope to keep the momentum going, not sure the best way to do that.  I think he responded to my complete breakdown which was good, but I don't know how to make sure the candle stays burning.  \n\n**Update**:\n\nLater that day he sent me another email saying thanks and it was really good for him and asking me if I was okay with \"pretend rape\" and \"being tied up\". \n\nI replied to his email with one line \"Yes OMG fuck yes!\"  \n\nHe didn't say a word about it going to bed, but this morning I woke up with his hand covering my mouth and saying \"shhhhh\" and the other hand working down my panties.  He \"forced\" himself on me (I gave him consent from email the day before) and took me roughly.  I didn't climax (he did) for some reason I have trouble climaxing from intercourse but it was still great.  After he came I was still hot and I manually finished myself off while looking in his eyes. \n\n**Thoughts**\n\nI think I've got it figured out, he has \"closet dominant\" tendencies, does not feel comfortable talking about it face-to-face IRL, and needs to hide behind some sort of technology like email to get permission.  Which is 100% ay-okay with me.  \n\nFor some reason he can't talk about sex, or won't. I'm also finding his libido seems much higher when we're partaking in the activities he wants to do, which seems to be domination, as opposed to conventional sex. \n\nFor my part, I'm along for the ride and trying to be encouraging and not scare him off LOL.  I'm answering his questions and being positive and giving consent via email even though we're seeing each other every day, and I'm making sure I don't ask him in person.  I think that would make him uncomfortable and awkward and maybe freeze up.  He also doesn't want to talk in person about the crazy awesome sex we've been having, just wants to pretend it didn't happen.\n\n","author_flair_text":null,"from_kind":null,"author":"kittenz-n-sunshine","saved":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"stickied":false,"score":18,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/3r1hqy/will_wonders_never_cease/","over_18":false,"ups":18,"permalink":"/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/3r1hqy/will_wonders_never_cease/"}

It wasn't ever a perfect system, but in the past couple of decades it's been increasingly difficult for cons and libs to work together. Younger people don\u2019t even remember a time when they did. It's so bad that a con can ruin his chance to be a national figure *simply by complimenting someone on the other side.* (see Chris Christie) In fact, the opposite usually gets them brownie points with the base.\n\n\nI believe this is the end result of the GOP courting the far right religious vote for so long. Evangelicals have a very black and white view of the world. Read the Fox FB page, for example, and see how every time the Pope (or catholics, or mormons\u2026) is brought up, the comments section is flooded with evangelicals screaming about how those people aren't Real Christians\u2122. They aren't of god, they are of Satan. You can only be with us or against us. This also goes for anyone outside Christianity, but the only people evangelicals hate more than muslims and atheists is each other\u2019 sects! I\u2019ll call this \u201cwrong\u201d side \u201cthe camp of evil,\u201d or COE for short.\n\n\nGOP politicians promised before each election to push the evangelical issues (like gay marriage) just to get their votes. People will come out to vote over hot button issues and politicians on both side know it.\n\n\nBut then the GOP didn't deliver because all presidential politicians pander to the extremes for votes and then drift towards the middle after the primaries. So more evangelical types started to run for office because they couldn't trust the GOP and they applied their \u201cus vs them\u201d mentality to everything. Obama was elected and many evangelicals were worked into a frenzy over the fact he's black, that he has an unusual name, that he doesn\u2019t hate gay marriage, etc. Anyone who doesn\u2019t toe the line is automatically in the COE. Not a True American. Not a Real Christian. If you don\u2019t agree you should leave the country.\n\n\nNotice that after the first debate the many Trump supporters were outraged by the way Fox treated him. The backlash towards Meghan Kelly &amp; Fox News was amazing. Hundreds of people commenting on even totally non-political Fox FB posts calling for Kelly to be fired, labeling the moderators \"liberals,\" and vowing to never watch Fox again.\n\n\nVisit any conservative conversation and the term RINO shows up often. On the liberal pages, however, you almost never see the term DINO. That\u2019s because the cons have lost all ability to compromise even within their own ranks. Liberals tend to agree to disagree. Boehner tried to work with the factions and get things done. His reward? Labeled a traitor. And a RINO. And the ones yelling this the most are\u2026you guessed it! The evangelical branch of the GOP. They brought their \u201chate anyone who isn\u2019t my kind of christian \u2013 I am always right and you are always wrong\u201d mentality and applied it to politics. This was an easy jump for them because for decades the GOP used hot button issues that appealed particularly to right wing christians in order to secure their votes. Hating abortion and gays isn\u2019t just a church issue \u2013 it\u2019s now it is political. The GOP and the church leaders saw to that.\n\n\nThe divisions in the GOP have grown so great that they\u2019re eating each other alive, and it\u2019s a situation they created themselves.\n\n\nOn the very night of Obama\u2019s first inauguration, a group of prominent GOPers got together and vowed to block *anything the new president did.* Conservative talk radio had their back, with the likes of Riush Limbaugh saying flat out that they \u201choped the president would fail.\u201d Think about that. Whole swaths of cons think it\u2019s better to hope our country fails rather than admit they are wrong about some things. They\u2019re happy to make their point by freezing our legislative process, shutting down the government, and ruining our credit rating!\n\n\nThey\u2019re prepared to do it again, all over Planned Parenthood funding, even though the money PP gets from the government goes solely to health care services. Remember above when I said, \u201cThey aren't of god, they are of Satan. You can only be with us or against us?\u201d They will lie, bend the truth, and refuse to listen to facts just to further their anti-abortion agenda. PP is a part of the COE, so it\u2019s okay to deprive women of health care to shut them down over a single service they provide which isn\u2019t even paid for by tax dollars - even if most clinics don't even have abortion services on site.\n\nThe only reason Planned Parenthood and abortion are such a huge issue right now is because of gay marriage. The GOP has been using the specter of gay marriage as a fundraising and vote getting tool for decades. This is the first major election cycle since the SCOTUS decision. We all should have seen it coming - the rabid attacks on abortion rights. The anti abortion group which produced the undercover videos has been working on them for a few years, but it can't be a coincidence that they were released now.  I feel really stupid that I didn't see this coming!\n\n\nThe GOP and evangelicals have the average conservative so turned around that they\u2019ll happily vote against their own interests whilst simultaneously demonizing large swaths of the populace. Help the poor? Oh, no, they are freeloaders. Instead of fixing the system lets just cut them off, require drugs tests, and print their names in the paper. Young women accidentally got pregnant? Tough shit. Let\u2019s say if she wasn\u2019t a whore she wouldn\u2019t be in this fix. Let\u2019s not help her out with prenatal care or after the baby is born. But she can\u2019t have an abortion, either. Pregnancy is her punishment for not having evangelical ideals. Pay people a living wage? Hell no! why should they get that? If they only bootstrapped their way into better (nonexistent) jobs they\u2019d be all set. Immigrants? Refugees of war? NO. They\u2019re all freeloaders and stealth terrorists. Doesn\u2019t matter that these conservatives consider themselves to be the best kind of christian. Jesus was a supporter of capitalism! He would agree that those people are not worth helping! Of course, Christians who don\u2019t agree are not Real Christians.\n\n\nThese newer far right GOP people think the way politics works is to demand everyone fall in line and give them what they want. A good government cannot function without actual debate and compromise. Broken welfare programs and a broken immigration system can only be solved with real conversation and real compromise.\n\n\nFacts mean nothing to them. Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t spend any tax money on abortions? Well if they get any tax dollars that *does* support abortions. What do you mean it\u2019s physically and financially impossible to toss out all illegal immigrants and build a wall? I need to hang onto the dream!

I might lose my coal mine job and have to trade in my Hummer if that\u2019s true, so it isn\u2019t true. The 3% of scientists are obviously right. Fox News tells me cops are being murdered by thugs at an unprecedented rate. Oh, statistics say cop shootings are down? I don't believe it. LALALALALA I CAN'T HEAR YOU.\n\n\nGOP politicians lie at will and the cons eat it up. When caught in a lie, they don\u2019t respond, blame the source that corrects them, and/or even say \u201cmy comment wasn\u2019t meant to be factually correct\u201d \u2013 and the cons love them for it. Oh, pardon me. It's not just the politicians who do it. Try supplying facts online and watch the personal attacks and denial run rampant. Any source they don't like is \"lamestream liberal media.\"\n\n\nNow that Boehner is gone it should get pretty interesting. The far right branch will still not compromise with the moderate branch, and certainly not with the dems. I think it doesn't matter who became the new Speaker. Nothing will get done, and, once again, the GOP will lose the presidential election. And although the anti abortion crowd has made great strides in recent years in their attempts to restrict access to the point where an abortion is essentially impossible to get, I think they tide will turn.\n\nMillenials are much less religious and much less socially conservative than the older generations.

When it came, I went to the door, didn't really pay much attention to the pizza guy, and got my delicious pizza. Skipping ahead to Thursday, I got a text on my phone from a number I didn't recognize, basically just a cute little compliment to my appearance. I started chatting with the person and learned he was, in the most adorable violation of my privacy ever, the pizza guy who got my number from work. Despite this, for whatever reason, I kept talking and shared a few (completely SFW) pictures. I find this guy really attractive and in our texts we've kind of clicked, but the two main problems are that a) he completely violated my privacy to talk to me, and I even told him that made me a bit uncomfortable and b) I'm 17 and he's 23. I live in a place where I've hit the AoC already, but that's still a larger age gap than I've ever had. If I ever actually dated him, I would probably have to lie to my parents for awhile about it. \n\nSo, I plan on meeting him in person at some point. Kind of hesitantly.

We went to the same school, which wasn't that big and everyone was friendly with each other. So she had sent me a friend request when I think I was a senior or junior in high school (k-12 school) and I accepted just because everyone is friendly with everyone else. Who cares, it's just a Facebook friend request, right?\n\n\nThat was many years ago. Sometime in the past few weeks I glanced at my feed and I'm stunned. She's the loveliest woman I've ever seen. I feel like she's more beautiful than a lot of models who dominate the media, who are paid to look good. It doesn't even seem like she's trying that hard but there's like a dreamlike quality to her pictures. Every smiling picture of her is like a drug, and every picture she has she is smiling. Her interests are not the same things I've been good at in my life, but they are the things I've wanted to explore since I graduated college. I'm an engineer now and I kind of fall into the stereotype where I liked video games growing up above most everything else, and I never developed a proper appreciation for music or visual arts because I was never good at either (I still can't color within the lines, kind of a problem on fill in bubble tests). I was never good at sports, but since starting college I find actually love watching football and basketball. The NBA probably saved my life. I have been trying to read more literature but I'm still a basic bitch when it comes to music and I have no idea how to find or appreciate the visual arts. School was my only thing until I graduated, getting cultured has been an interest only since then.\n\n\nI don't know anything about her beyond what's up on Facebook. I don't want to keep fantasizing about someone I don't know. I'm 25 and I'm sure I've never spoken to her. She goes to school in a college town about an hour or two outside of the city (I myself am in a suburb 30 minutes outside of the city, and in the opposite direction!), though she apparently visits the city for concerts regularly. She puts up positive and punny (pun and funny) and silly things on Facebook, but again I don't know the real her. I only know the image of a person put up on social media. I think part of the appeal is that she has complementary interests to my professional/personal interests, rather than parallel interests (ha ha math joke).\n\n\nIt's really not fair to have an unrealistic expectation of someone I don't know, and I don't want to be a Facebook creeper. But I've been reconnecting with friends (who I did know in high school) who now live in the city. A lot of them visit cultural events like concerts featuring like indie music performers, and there might be a situation where they both happen to be at the same concert (no idea if they would happen to know her).\n\n\nI have this stupid fucking fantasy that I stumble upon her while meeting my friends and experiencing the city culture, then we hit it off and she falls in love with me and I fall in love with her (not just infatuation). It's not going to happen, as I feel like I'd be disingenuous to my real friends to treat them as stepping stones to a woman that I don't really know. I haven't talked to some of these friends in a long time and I want to be genuine with them because I don't have many friends where I live and work, and in the past year I've realized life is nothing without other people with which to share (a lesson never taught to me in school but what everyone else seems to know innately).\n\n\nI also get like this dumbass fucking idea sometimes that I could message her politely and build a friendship through Facebook then eventually meet up for a relaxed date. In this idiotic fantasy I demonstrate that I could be a partner for her while doing some cultural activity and she is interested and we start dating and things progress like a fairy tale from there. But it's nonsense, I have nothing to suggest common interests and I feel like that would be an inappropriate boundary to cross since (again) I've never actually talked to her before.\n\n\nI haven't had a crush for like 8 years. High school wasn't a bad experience for me but I didn't have the independence of a lot of my friends since I didn't have my own car. Looking back I think I was just oblivious to some of the girls who may have liked me at the time, so I never had those sorts of high school relationships though I had plenty of guy and girl friends. I had to deal with severe medical issues and depression arising from those medical issues during college, and I never had typical college experience (even for an engineering focused school). So in addition to not having much experience communicating with girls, just generally I have no friends from college because it was just school and video games out of depression and anxiety over random and completely unrelated illnesses that could send me to the hospital again (the 1st and 5th times were the worst). It took me a long time to accept my shitty luck. I'm fine now that I graduated (though it was delayed) and independent and building an adult life with adult responsibilities, like helping my family.\n\n\nI don't know why I feel this way about her. I guess I need to vent and maybe someone help me out here. It's not fair to her. I can't even pinpoint why, but it just doesn't feel right to place that kind of expectation on another person even if they don't know it. I want to know her quirks and what makes her happy and what makes her mad and what she loves to do. I want her to want to know me the same way, but this isn't the 19th century where you can claim to love someone from afar and hit it off from there. That's just for weird people now, and while I'm a little weird in my own way I am not a 'red pill' who thinks I deserve the attention and affection of this particular woman. What little I do know about her makes me want to know more, because what I see is a lovely person.\n\n\nI'm taking steps to build my own life, like building good habits that I never previously developed and otherwise working on improving myself. I want to be a person that can be there for my friends, because even though I haven't kept as close as I should they're still dear to me. But every day now, I get the uncontrollable urge to peek at a picture of this woman, who I don't know, who doesn't know me, and who I likely will never get a chance to know, and who probably doesn't want to know me (not assuming negative intention, just that she probably gets bothered a ton by guys).\n\n\nDuring downtime at work or afterwards if I'm not engaged in something my thoughts drift to trying to stage some 'chance' meeting in the city or the college town. Lots of my friends actually went to that college, but it's a big state school so lol finding someone by chance. I don't remember my crushes from middle or high school affecting me this much, and the social distance being what it is makes it worse (at least 13 year old me had an excuse to crush on a girl in class). My dumbass subconscious is egging me to talk to her somehow, but there's no way to do that without being creepy. I consciously recognize it's absurd, but I unconsciously think it'd be a great idea to get in touch even though she has no reason to respond or bother with my basic ass.\n\n\ntl;dr Help me stop fantasizing and Facebook stalking someone I've never talked to.","from_kind":null,"author":"crushing_temp","link_flair_css_class":"m-io personal","saved":false,"stickied":false,"score":2,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3r1p3y/i_25m_have_a_ridiculous_crush_on_a_facebook/","over_18":false,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/3r1p3y/i_25m_have_a_ridiculous_crush_on_a_facebook/","ups":2,"domain":"self.relationships","distinguished":null,"secure_media":null,"hide_score":false,"title":"I [25M] have a ridiculous crush on a Facebook friend [21F] that I've never met.","is_self":true,"id":"3r1p3y","thumbnail":"self","link_flair_text":"Personal issues","downs":0,"num_comments":5,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"media":null,"created_utc":"1446350577","created":1446379377,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"relationships","media_embed":{}}

She convinced me I'd probably really like sucking dick. I agree. She said I could share her boyfriend if I ever visited. I agreed.\n* When I watch porn, I almost always wind up leaning more towards shemales than the standard pornstar hot girls. Again, I think it's a penis thing.\n* Girls in strapons are just as attractive as girls without them. You see the pattern emerging, no?\n\nSo, what do I want from you? The short answer is; I don't know. The longer answer, is that I want feedback from you. I want to flirt with men and have them flirt back. I want you to tease me like my other pen-pal. I want to chat or roleplay or just explore with you. I'd also quite enjoy it if you called me a faggot. That always gives me a weird kind of thrill.\n\nBonus points for TGirls!\n\nThank you for reading. I know my posts get ramble-y. Hopefully I can repay you the time you've spent on me.","from_kind":null,"author":"sept6throwaway","stickied":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":true,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3r1pk1/21_m4a_maybe_kinda_bicurious/","score":1,"permalink":"/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3r1pk1/21_m4a_maybe_kinda_bicurious/","ups":1}

What I am speaking about is how I am sick of constantly failing at girls. To keep this post short, ever since I was a child I was fat not chubby but fat. Point is that growing up through elementary, middle and high school I have not had a good track record with girls. They have always seemed to never shown an interest in me, or have me a chance. Fast forward to my senior year of high school and over the course of the year I dropped 50 lbs and still had no luck. Being the gulable person I am in myself I thought that losing weight would fix my problem. Fast forward again to the present and I have dropped 20 more pounds and want to continue to reach 180 (at 200). The real problem is that inside even though externally I look different inside I feel the same. I still have zero confidence and often don't know what to say because not a lot has worked for me. This bothers me as I really want to find that special person in my life. What really grinds my gears is how I know for a fact that I am not ugly just based on what I see, and I am 6 feet tall as well. And that I classify myself as a good guy and not a douche bag and would like to find a good girl as well. I just don't know what to do and say to not screw another chance for myself again.

Since it was a few small jobs and he was a best friend I had decided to just pay him cash with an oral agreement of the payment. He agreed to this and worked with me a period of 2 weeks and 1 day. He had worked three consecutive Mondays with another, on-the-table female worker and friend. Due to reasons she only worked those three Mondays.\n\nStarting on the first day he was talking to her in crude language that made her extremely uncomfortable. I was in a tight spot with finding help and was under a considerable amount of stress (I was later diagnosed with severe anxiety), and my friend, being the saint that she is, kept up with it to help me finish the work. The next Monday the verbal harassment was worst, and the third Monday it had escelated to sexual assault when he (according to the girl, I was not witness but on-site) had tried to put his hands down her shirt, and touched her butt.\n\nUpon hearing this after the day had ended, I decided to take action, I confronted him via text message and told him to get lost. I also hadn't at the time paid him for the week which totalled to $220 CAD. I figured the consequences of a sexual assault charge was way worst than the withheld payment, and decided I would let my now ex-best friend off the hook and drop it. He become very angry and we hadn't talked since.\n\nI am wary because as a (dumb) student, I hadn't been ensuring the safest work environment, bending the safety rules, like safe ladder use, and he was well aware of that, although it is seemingly irrelevant. As well as paying him in cash.\n\n\n\nFast forward to today.\nI had just gotten into the door of a mutual friends house where there was a small 14-sum party. The ex-friend came in the door and had shoved me out of the way to get past. I kept my cool and shrugged it off, instead talking to my friends by the door. He then came back and shoved me into a friend, knocking that friend over and bringing with him another friend to the floor. He then yelled some obscenities at me, grabbed me by the collar and clocked me in the face. Entirely unprovoked and with many sober witnesses.\n\nMy advice is, if I were to press charges, and he decided to bring up past things like the payment under the table and the safety shortcomings, what consequences I could face as a brief but legitimate business owner. I have since stopped working and essentially closed the business. I am willing to take the financial fines on the taxes etc. if it was brought to light.\n\nAs an extra question, how would I go about pressing charges against him and if you feel I should. I'd of course like this sub-reddits removed opinion since my perspective is biased with ex-friendship, and I still feel too young and over my head to tackle this appropriately.\n\n\nThank you for taking the time for reading this, and sorry for any formatting errors as I'm on mobile.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rawz","secure_media_embed":{},"name":"t3_3r1qr2","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1450692240,"from":null,"locked":false,"archived":false,"over_18":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3r1qr2/got_punched_in_the_face_by_an_exemployee_who/","score":0,"permalink":"/r/legaladvice/comments/3r1qr2/got_punched_in_the_face_by_an_exemployee_who/","ups":0,"author":"iambored456","from_kind":null,"stickied":false,"saved":false,"link_flair_css_class":null}

Just to let you readers know.\nAlright, so, last weekend, I was hanging out with a friend and I ordered pizza for the two of us. When it came, I went to the door, didn't really pay much attention to the pizza guy, and got my delicious pizza. Skipping ahead to Thursday, I got a text on my phone from a number I didn't recognize, basically just a cute little compliment to my appearance. I started chatting with the person and learned he was, in the most adorable violation of my privacy ever, the pizza guy who got my number from work. Despite this, for whatever reason, I kept talking and shared a few (completely SFW) pictures. I find this guy really attractive and in our texts we've kind of clicked, but the two main problems are that a) he completely violated my privacy to talk to me, and I even told him that made me a bit uncomfortable and b) I'm 17 and he's 23. I live in a place where I've hit the AoC already, but that's still a larger age gap than I've ever had. If I ever actually dated him, I would probably have to lie to my parents for awhile about it.\nSo, I plan on meeting him in person at some point. Kind of hesitantly. What sort of advice do you have for me, LGBTeens, or would you suggest I steer away from that completely?

We live in the same apartment complex (those buildings with more than 1 apartment tower and a leisure area, with a pool, gym, etc). \n\nOur relationship is already on \"I love you\" level. We both go to college (everyday, it's in another town, but we don't study in the same place), and get back at around 2 PM. By that time, we use to go to the stairs and make out (sometimes it's a calm session, sometimes we do it like there's no tomorrow), and things often get hot, and I get carried by the situation. She's actually okay with my hand wandering through her body, as long as we're by ourselves (fair enough).\n\nThe problem comes now: she's religious. Like very much. She's not catholic, she's evangelical (*), she strongly believes it's wrong to have sex before marriage, and that's the root of all the problems we have. Every time we argue it looks like it was caused mainly by that. Sometimes we get caught in little arguments like whether or not she should do something I ask (not sexual, sometimes just hang around by our building), and she doesn't accept it, saying it's not right, it's not a proper thing to do right now, aaaaaand you know what. And I can't get rid of the feeling it's all caused by the sex-issue (somehow her religion says \"it's wrong to have sexual contact before marriage\"). It makes me really sad because we have so much spare time (and space)...\n\nI would really appreciate some advice on how to lead with these kind of things. I really want to have sex with her, I just love her, but I don't know if I can't handle the no-sex relationship, and MAINLY, all those little irritations that come with it.  Should I just accept it? Do I need to live my relationship like she wants it to be? Do I have any options?\n\nAnd just saying, but her parents, although being religious as well, don't seem to be so devout as she is. It really upsets me how she by herself puts her religion above everything in her life - including me, her \"loved boyfriend\".\n\n\nTL;DR: 10 month relationship, both 18 y/o, girlfriend lives in the same apartment complex than me. She is very religious, strongly believes sex (and most things related to that) before marriage is wrong, and this belief has implications, which make me sad. What are my options?\n\n_______________\n* = I don't know if the meaning of \"evangelical\" in English equals the meaning it has in Portuguese, but I'm sure it comes close\nEDIT: obligatory excuse for my mediocre english.","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","secure_media_embed":{},"name":"t3_3r1umv","retrieved_on":1450692190,"locked":false,"from":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"relationships","media_embed":{},"edited":1446354882,"media":null,"created_utc":"1446354343","created":1446383143,"link_flair_text":"Dating","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"num_comments":4,"quarantine":false,"domain":"self.relationships","distinguished":null,"secure_media":null,"hide_score":false,"is_self":true,"title":"Me [18] and my girlfriend [18 F] (10 months) - Having a sex-religion-related issue","id":"3r1umv"}

{"from_id":null,"selftext":"Honestly, at the 45 minute mark I messaged my younger brother saying something like, \"I'm 45 minutes in, and it's not terrible. Kind of decent, actually. Does it get worse?\" It did, but only to a certain degree. The CGI for The Thing wasn't as terrible as I expected (everyone made it sound like he was basically a cartoon character), I didn't notice Sue's wig change color drastically (and even if it seemed a little lighter, I chocked that up to her powers messing with the color), and I thought Doom was kind of cool in his assault on the lab scene (those brain explosion splatters were brutal). That said, damn did it fly by. Things felt unnecessarily rushed at times. The \"1 year later\" felt forced, but after a few minutes I forgave the movie for jumping us forward so abruptly. I didn't really want to see a montage of everyone learning how to use their powers. The climax felt a bit anticlimactic and definitely rushed, the final fight being a little silly and way too quick/clean/simple, and when it abruptly ended I was like, \"Wait, that's it? Was that the final battle?\"  \n\nIt's not something I'd watch multiple times just for the hell of it, but I also didn't think it was as unforgivably god-awful as I was led to believe. There have been worse Marvel movies, and there have definitely been better ones. Felt like a lot was probably left on the cutting room floor or maybe the script was just written to be succinct and short, leaving out a lot on purpose. Tim Blake Nelson chewing gum got to me, and at one point I thought, \"Well, maybe he's like an alien or something and he's chewing that gum to keep him breathing/human ala Mars Attacks. That didn't pan out. Reed was pretty flat, as was Sue, but Johnny and Ben had a little more motivation (Johnny finally found a purpose, and Ben hoped they'd be able to turn him back). In the end, I was pleasantly surprised for the most part. I was expecting a train wreck of epic proportions. Instead, I got a sub-par superhero movie. I think people are so caught up in the Marvel universe right now that any movie that doesn't blow them away is immediately discredited as awful. Everyone's a critic.
