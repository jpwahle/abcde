Fortunately, I am able to handle urges and flatline relatively well. The problem is about 3 weeks in, I began to experience symptoms of depression. My mood was low, I didn't feel good whilst doing things I used to enjoy and I found it hard to stay motivated enough to finish homework.

I had a question that I'm not sure falls into the realm of this subreddit exactly but I thought this was a good start.\n\nBasically my living situation has become so in the air that I am attempting to find a place to live back in my hometown. Right now my car payments are $300 and my insurance is the same amount. I am in a place financially where I have to choose between living on my own and owning my own car, and I'm opting to go for the living situation. \n\nSo I have this car that I leased for $13,000 in March of this year. I had the thought that to cover my initial expenses to move into a place, and since I'm not breaking even on the car anyway, I'd sell my car and keep a portion of the money I get for it and tuck it away, all while maintaining the payments the lease holder. While I am inexperienced, I am 23 and only have about 3 years of credit history, I feel like it'd be more prudent in the long run to have a good buffer zone and keep an open credit line in an attempt to build a better score. \n\nMy first question is-- is this legal? Forgive me if it's an obvious answer. My second question is if this would be more harmful than beneficial in the long run. At this point in my life I really don't think I can afford such a high car payment/insurance rate and also rent in the area I'm looking (About $900/month). \n\nAgain, if this is the wrong place to post this don't hesitate to let me know and I will rectify the issue!

{"ups":41,"edited":false,"id":"5ft9wv","spoiler":false,"score":41,"author_flair_css_class":null,"selftext":"I don't know if this post belongs here but I think the whole idea that you have to eat from 3 to 3 hours or less when you're trying to lose weight ridiculous. I know this has been discussed before as \"starvation mode\" is one of the most discussed topics here, but I just wanted to give my two cents.\n\n\nI think that having so many meals a day actually hurts your diet and well-being a lot more than it does for good when you're trying to shed those pounds. I'll tell the story:\n\n\nWhen I was 11-12 I was slightly chubby and I wanted to lose it. Fast forward a few years to when I'm 13 and I decide to do something about it. I had no idea how, I wasn't even so much into junk food (typical crap like burgers, hot dogs, soda), but I would graze all day on cookies - which was a psychological issue and not a diet issue, because I was doing it out of boredom/for comfort. \n\n\nSo, my mom took me to a nutriotinist. Here in my country you have to go to college for 4 years to get your diploma and work as one, so, I thought her words meant everything. (Saying this because once in this sub I saw someone saying that anybody can get a nutriotinist certificate in the US so I don't know how it works) \n\n\nShe gave me 1200 calories for the day to be consumed in 6 meals (~200 kcal per meal... gee) to lose weight. I had no idea what calories were, only that this number was the secret to lose that annoying bit of belly fat. I really had NO IDEA what calories were, my young self didn't care much because she gave me a  list of food I could eat and of course I thought I could gorge on anything there and still lose. It sounded so easy, I could just pick anything from that list and on my meal times and lose weight without worrying much. Except that 2 months on that I had barely lost 5 pounds (I was exercising 5 days a week, going to the gym, doing light stuff and mostly cardio but lifting weights already, I started at 13 yo though) \n\n\nAnd I was eating 6 meals religiously because she said my metabolism would slow down if I didn't and of course I wanted to keep it burning fast. Can you guys even imagine how \"fun\" my meals were? I didn't eat junk for MONTHS, because I was so afraid of ruining my progress. I thought 1 slice of pizza = weight gain. And it didn't help a bit with the mentality of eating all the time because I was encouraged to eat even if I wasn't hungry. I was feeling miserable not only at the lack of results but about the fact that I'd always see the other girls eating junk and my precious Oreos without gaining a pound and not doing a single bit of exercising. Of course later on this developed into anorexia specially because my father was always pointing out how \"round\" I was (128 lbs/124 lbs 5'2)\n\n\nI wanted to kill myself every day of my life because I hated how I looked, I was putting a lot of effort into exercising and eating right and this woman I trusted so much, who was supposed to help me, only made things worse.  After years of unhealthy relationships with food, it's been 1 year since I found out the best for me is eating 2 meals a day with some coffee in between and of course CICO. CICO is the most liberating thing because it allows you to eat everything you want as long as you count it. \n\n\nHonestly, I took the ED way and lost a lot of weight but I could have done otherwise, specially with the active FA movement, and just have given up because it was my \"genetics\". Since I was doing everything SUPPOSEDLY right and I was having no results... It could only be, right? Never in my life I had felt so miserable and I feel empathetic about people trying to hop on the same journey of weight loss we have gone or are going through but without the knowledge to make things go right.\n\n\nYesterday I was doing a research out of curiosity and there are SO MANY websites spreading bullshit like this. Starvation mode, gut bacteria that causes you to be/remain obese, \"calories are a lie\", etc... I can't even feel angry at some people for trying and giving up quickly only to spread fatlogic because there's so many lies going on...","saved":false,"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media":null,"archived":false,"media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/fatlogic/comments/5ft9wv/discussion_nutriotinistsdoctors_can_do_plenty_of/","secure_media_embed":{},"num_comments":25,"quarantine":false,"locked":false,"name":"t3_5ft9wv","gilded":0,"subreddit":"fatlogic","over_18":false,"media_embed":{},"is_self":true,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1484291434,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1480551280,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2wyxm","domain":"self.fatlogic","title":"[Discussion] Nutriotinists/Doctors can do plenty of disservice to their overweight patients...","hide_score":false,"contest_mode":false,"permalink":"/r/fatlogic/comments/5ft9wv/discussion_nutriotinistsdoctors_can_do_plenty_of/"}

I am 6' tall, 170 pounds, with a solid upper body sitting atop a super-skinny, bony lower body.  Basically, I have legs women wish they had.\n\nNext, the incident: I was rolling with an older (i.e., my age) white  belt who is in reality a solid blue belt as far as skill level goes; he's CLEARLY a level up from me (and I'm definitely what you'd categorize as a \"solid\" white belt), he does no-gi classes consistently at another gym, he knows a fair amount about grappling and he regularly taps fellow white belts with ease.  He is also considerably bigger than I am at 6'4, 210 pounds.  He's a super nice guy and I enjoy going with him because I know it's going to be a real challenge to do ANYTHING to this guy...\n\nSo there I was, on top of side control (we had started out that way), when he moved from under side control to half guard, at which point he grapevined my right leg with his left so he could put me in full guard.  I guess I didn't wanna budge (though I eventually did), and he eventually took full guard.  I didn't notice anything had happened until after we'd finished, when I couldn't stand up.  I don't remember any \"popping\" or \"tearing\" anything, I just remember being like \"oh fuck, my knee- something's wrong.\"  I toughed it out and went on with class (yeah, I know), not rolling anymore but still drilling.  I then showered, and left in a lot of pain.\n\nNow it's the next day and I can barely walk.  I went to the orthopedist who checked me out manually and ordered an MRI, which I'll get tomorrow.  I asked him what he thinks it is if he had to guess and he said he thinks I've torn my meniscus, but that my ACL (which I already had reconstructed back in 1992) also felt a bit \"loose.\"  He said \"we'll see precisely what's up when we get the MRI back.\"\n\nAnd that's it.  The guy who I was rolling with when this happened feels terrible about it- I told him not to worry about it and that things happen in a combat sport.  I probably did the wrong thing by trying to resist/fight my way out of the grapevine rather than just going with it.  The thing is, I had no idea what was happening and was just kind of \"going at it\" as usual.  I have no idea what i could've done differently, besides either going limp and not resisting or just tapping.  Also, it's weird that I didn't feel anything until AFTER the roll.  The whole thing was/is kind of bizarre.  \n\nAnyway I'm really upset because I know I'll be off the mats for quite a while (4-6 months?), and that really scares me.  Also, I'm in tremendous pain and can't really get around that well.  Needless to say I am NOT happy.  Lastly, sorry for all the words (including details that may or may not have been germane to the story)- I just needed to get this off my chest and I didn't want to leave anything out.\n\nI am so fucked right now.","saved":false,"id":"5fta8t","spoiler":false,"edited":1480551907,"ups":7}

I had temperament problems as a child and teenager and combined with a mother doesn't understand why things aren't always perfect for her, there was a LOT of fighting. Rebellious shitty temperamental teen combined with a mom who just has to get her way.... not fun.\n\nStruggling to find the best way to describe my situation here. I guess I'll just cut straight to the end? You guys can ask for details if you want, I've got a ton of stories and personal justifications for my actions that I wouldn't mind getting some thoughts on.\n\n**Sorry about the long read, just want to be clear on everything. Let me know if anything isn't!**\n\n---------------------\n\nSo as it happened recently, my mom messaged me asking why I didn't have her on facebook. I had her boyfriend and my grandma, but not her and she felt that she deserved better and it was hurting more every day. I end up giving her a pretty safe response. I tried not to attack her directly or anything, just kept my wording to stuff like \"I'm not really comfortable with that right now\" and \"I need some more time and I feel like I'm being pressured on all sides,\" while trying to re-assure her that I am trying and if she'll be a bit more patient I'm sure we can make our relationship work. Because I do want that, I honestly do.\n\nIt was a long message because I wanted to make sure there was no mistakes or misunderstandings. [This was her response](http://imgur.com/CAzTgDT). Very little in her response seemed to reference what I had just said and it seemed very carbon copy from what I know of her.\n\nIt didn't seem like she had actually read any of my messages so I decided to try a little fun experiment. I started including random bits of gibberish to see if she was actually reading my messages or not:\n\n* **Test #1**: Referencing an argument I never made. [Failed.](http://imgur.com/3axuuB8)\n\n* **Test #2**: Using VERY obviously incorrect facts to support my argument. [Failed.](http://imgur.com/a/h4Nkl)\n\n* **Test #3**: Using words that when skimming, look like a sentence but when actually read aloud are complete gibberish. [Failed in spades.](http://imgur.com/a/41OWS)\n\n[Obviously she isn't reading my messages  any more than the first few sentences so I decide to reveal it to her and I basically get brushed off.](http://imgur.com/a/OOxb2)\n\nI'm getting pretty annoyed and just decide to cut to the chase. Gonna be a bit cutting here, serious as possible, don't want her to think I'm just mocking her for the sake of mocking her but rather trying to prove a point. [I don't think she's taking this conversation seriously.](http://imgur.com/cfHEkvL)\n\nI mean I was really hurt by this. Not only was she not reading my messages I'm getting the impression that she's not taking me seriously at all which, y'know, feels a bit soul-crushing as to my hopes of having a solid relationship with her. How do you have a serious discussion with someone who doesn't really take you seriously? How do you build off of that kind of weak foundation?\n\n-----------------\n\n**So here's where I'm at right now. I called and told her that I wouldn't be coming home for Christmas (I moved out last year to a place within easy transit distance so it's not like I'm just refusing to buy a plane ticket or anything) and that I'd see her in the new year.** \n\nThe first problem I'm having is this. She's not had an easy life and she's not a bad person. She worked hard to get herself and my dad out of poverty and into an upper-middle class neighborhood with a lower-middle class income. She's a smart cookie when she stops thinking with her heart and actually thinks with her brain from time to time! Then there's the shit like my dad passing away slowly over the course of five years which really took a toll on her, especially as she was taking care of him through most of it while also trying to keep mine and my sister's lives as normal as possible. My dad's brother and sister have generally cut her out of their lives because she was scared of being alone and hooked up with one of my dad's friends about a year after he died, and she's growing ever distant from me. She's big on family, and they're all leaving her. Again I don't think my mom's really a bad person, I more or less think she's confused and dealing with it in the only way she knows how which is unhealthy and only serves to push more people away. She's shown she does love me and care for me, but I'm not sure if she cares *about* me.\n\nAs an interesting side-note, she mentioned on the phone that she **did** read my messages but didn't want to say anything because she was worried that I'd freak out on her for saying something wrong because I've given her the impression that she can never say anything right around me. I somewhat understand that, I was shitty and emotionally reactionary as a teenager which probably led to a lot of instability in the relationship. Unfortunately it'd be a lot easier to believe this line if she didn't do the exact same thing in real life conversations (just talking about something completely different without acknowledging that I've said anything)\n\nThe other problem, my grandma organized a big family dinner and my mom will be there. I love my grandma, I can't say no. The unfortunate bit here is that my grandma doesn't really like my mother but because she's very big on family tells me that I shouldn't fight with her and I should respect her simply because she's my mom. My sister is more concerned with my mom and seems to have the impression that I'm just messing with her because I don't care. When confronted she actually revealed that she doesn't care how I feel because I'm hurting mom. If my mom's boyfriend doesn't show up I've got no allies here.\n\n---------------\n\nI guess, breaking it down, I'm more afraid of losing that stability of my family. Of knowing that they'll always be there and take care of me and if they're this dedicated then there's nothing I can do to really lose them unless I do it on purpose. I think this is a relationship based on a fear of being alone and the only way I can solve this problem is to lie to myself and pretend everything's okay when it's clearly not.\n\nI don't know what to do with this whole situation. It's starting to feel like the beginning of the end. Sorry if any of this was unclear, let me know in the comments.\n\n**TL;DR My mom proved that she doesn't read anything I send her or listen to me at all so I told her I'm not coming home for christmas, one of the few times I see my family each year. I still love my mom and I know she loves me.**\n\nedit: Light bit of clarification, I'm 23, moved out, and am completely self-dependent financially.","saved":false,"link_flair_text":"[Advice Request]","media":null,"downs":0,"archived":false,"secure_media":null,"edited":1480555098,"ups":3,"id":"5ftcrt","spoiler":false,"post_hint":"self","preview":{"images":[{"variants":{},"resolutions":[{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/WU_QAXFd8wRTo5HStPHWJ-iC7oFNt6vtP396UldHhhs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=900fbc8224c5852911187ab5ba64ff0a","height":105,"width":108},{"width":216,"height":211,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/WU_QAXFd8wRTo5HStPHWJ-iC7oFNt6vtP396UldHhhs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=17e923c317cc036f96e42463a41a7308"},{"width":320,"height":313,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/WU_QAXFd8wRTo5HStPHWJ-iC7oFNt6vtP396UldHhhs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=3e53710bab39c65cd0c071aecd5b9b14"}],"id":"Yd0It2xCAKpqiCOphBQOZmxhUgj11IAB213I-RKrdjw","source":{"height":464,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/WU_QAXFd8wRTo5HStPHWJ-iC7oFNt6vtP396UldHhhs.jpg?s=29a1b2e98928aaaf38fdd8e62007aa04","width":473}}]},"subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","distinguished":null,"domain":"self.raisedbynarcissists","permalink":"/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5ftcrt/mom_is_likely_narcissistic_but_has_dealt_with_a/","contest_mode":false,"title":"Mom is likely narcissistic, but has dealt with a lot of bad shit in her life that she doesn't deserve and honestly loves me.

{"link_flair_css_class":null,"thumbnail":"self","selftext":"I'm 17/MTF/Pre-Everything, and I'm so confused with my gender.\n\n\nSo I think there is a chance I have gender dysphoria, although it's only really been noticable since I realized I'm trans in mid-october this year. Since then time has been moving extremely quick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've always had a preference for female things, but I've never shown it. It's not what is expected of me as a boy. I do mountain biking, I act like any other teen boy my age, but inside I really wish I could be more girly, but I just cannot do it. I got no courage or anything. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have quite strong memories of being 6 or 7 and wanting to try on dresses. I remember I went to a fancy dress party when I was 7, and when we where looking for a costume, my older sister picked out a princess one and she jokingly said \"how about this?\". I said \"No, that's for girls\", but inside I wanted to wear it, but I knew I couldn't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also remember my sister also joked that boys turn into girls and girls turn into boys when they grow up. I said \"no, I want to be a boy!\" but I was actually excited about it. I never told anyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was 11 I always sat like a girl (legs together, or crossed). I used to do it to act like the other girls, but never knew why I liked doing it. I did it until someone commented on why I sit like that. I stopped sitting like that forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I was 12 I started cross dressing in secret. When I was home alone I'd like to try on female outfits (mainly from my sisters clothes). Most people that have a cross dressing fetish likes female underwear, stockings, but I liked wearing female outfits, and trying them on. It was more of a fetish, but I loved wearing them a lot. Although I always wanted to wear them out in public and not weird. I tried on makeup (especially foundation) and I loved how feminine my face looked. No idea why I liked it so much back then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast forward to this year. My sister moved out in May, and I could no longer cross dress. In June, I bought a wig, and I wanted to wear it out in public (too scared to). My friend knew I had it, and he said I look \"like a trans girl\". I kinda liked him thinking that, dunno why though. This was before I knew I was trans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen about september my best friend stated to think I might be trans (the wig). He said that (don't know if it was a joke or not) I would be most likely to come out as transgender. Back then I didn't really know what being transgender really was, so I thought I wasn't trans, and denied it. I said to him if I would of preferred to be a girl, but that doesn't make me transgender. After that I started looking up being trans, but I was reading how trans people feel like in the \"wrong body\". I knew I wasn't like that, so I just presumed I wasn't trans and never thought of it again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn October everything changed. I read things put on here, I some how ended up watching a video about trans people, and I started looking up being trans again. Then for some reason, one evening in October (14th October to be exact) me being trans completely clicked into place. It was like I've discovered some huge part of my life that I haven't been aware of. I'm getting all these memories (all said above) that all seem to match about being trans. I've never had gender dysphoria before, but after realizing I might be trans I'm now getting it. Although all the feelings I'm getting, I don't know if I am making this up in my mind or not, I have no clue. I don't like my voice that much any more, as it is quite deep. I am a little on the, lets say heavy side. I have man-boobs, and before I hated them, but now I actually like them and try and make them show more. Also my sex drive has gone right down after realizing I might be trans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't have all the feelings like a lot of trans people. Like I don't have any genital dysphoria whatsoever. When I was taught about puberty I was excited for the changes I'd get, like growing facial hair, deeper voice, etc. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe dysphoria I am getting keeps changing. When I'm alone, it gets quite bad, especially at night time. The other day I felt like smashing my phone up because I'm so confused. I see myself in 10 years time killing myself if I don't transition, or if I transition I see me being really depressed because I was born male and/or I don't pass. When I'm with friends I don't really get much dysphoria, and it's completely fine. But when it goes down, I want it to come back. When it goes away it doesn't feel right to me, despite only having it since october time. \n\n\nI also think this might be just a phase I am going through. In a few months time I will be fine, and I will look back at this and think I was just stupid thinking I am trans. \n\n\nAnyone have any clue? Anyone relate?\n\n\n\nSorry for the wall of text. I never planned on writing this much.","saved":false,"score":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_text":null,"media":null,"archived":false,"secure_media":null,"downs":0,"edited":false,"ups":0,"spoiler":false,"id":"5ftef2","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4b9","distinguished":null,"permalink":"/r/asktransgender/comments/5ftef2/i_dont_know_what_is_going_on_with_me/","contest_mode":false,"title":"I don't know what is going on with me","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.asktransgender","quarantine":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"num_comments":4,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5ftef2/i_dont_know_what_is_going_on_with_me/","stickied":false,"created_utc":1480552594,"retrieved_on":1484291498,"is_self":true,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Wed2249","media_embed":{},"subreddit":"asktransgender","over_18":false,"gilded":0,"locked":false,"name":"t3_5ftef2"}

Long black hair reaching down to her waist.  Oh yeah she's white.  Outfit (but female): https://imgur.com/VNI0bQD\n[Dragon]  A large black dragon with red streaks running down the body.  \n[True Form] (Copied from roleplay) I'm 8 feet tall, with a humanoid figure. Two arms, two legs, and a head. My skin is a reddish purple colour, and it appears to always be moving, like galaxies themselves are moving under my flesh. My arms are long and slender, ending in what appears to be purple flaming fingers. There appears to be small flaming wings extending from my elbows up to my shoulders. My face is normal, nose, mouth, eyes, however it all seems slightly more, alien. My eyes are completely black, with white dots in them, my mouth doesn't appear to have lips, and my nose is smaller, only a small bumb with two nostrils. My legs exist, but don't at the same time. They appear to disappear into a sort of super Nova like fog starting at my shins.\n\nPersonality:  Very open about everything.  Not easily embarrassed.  Pretty dominant in relationships (hi Kaz) and enjoys intimacy of all kinds.  Physical contact is very important to her.  She hates tight places, but she can handle it as long as it's not underwater.  She actually loves water though, it's a nice break from the constant fire.  Loves showers, swimming and always keep a water bottle on her.  Wants to be the best person she can be.  Always strives for equality among everyone, and just wants peace.  Takes alot to piss her off but when she finally hits they breaking point it's terrifying.  (Shes also scared of spiders, only small ones though.)\n\nLore: No clue where she was born.  She has the very unique ability to travel between different dimensions.  Only a few handful have ever had this power, not even gods themselves have it.  However she has almost no power in each dimension, limited by only what a mortal can do.  However she has mastered the art of flame magic.  With this power she has learned to make physical weapons out of pure flame, ranging from a bow, to chained Kami's.  She now travels from dimension to dimension attempting to fix everyone's issues, creating world peace everywhere she goes.  She is currently in a relationship with Kaz.\n\n\n\nIf there are any details I left out feel free to tell me and I'll add them.\n\n\n","score":2,"author_flair_css_class":"Fire"}

Thank god for honest people but the situation is bad either way. Christmas looked bleak before but unfortunately now it's a sure thing we won't be able to afford anything for Christmas this year.\n\nThe kind folks over at /r/assistance have been kind enough to send us things for our newest family member in the way of clothes, toiletries, shoes, and several other necessities she was left without after leaving home. We were told to come here to seek help from the lovely people in the community. Everyone was so helpful with children's toys last year for our newborn and his older brother. It's quite a read but for backstory on recent events we've dealt with here is the thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/580y1d/in_need_of_clothing_for_a_16_year_old_girl_who/\n\nWe're not well off financially, even less so now that we have an extra family member to take care but we're together happy and spirits are high now that we're all home and safe. I'm 27 and support the entire household on my own as my wife must stay home with our youngest who still fights frequent health problems. \n\nI'm working on a wish list of things through Amazon and will update this post as soon as I can. I'm not looking for anything for myself I just want to know that if possible something will be available come Christmas for everyone else in my household.\n\nBless all of you who work so hard to take care of the less fortunate during the holiday seasons. From someone whose family experiences hard times frequently just know that you've brought so much happiness to so many people here and it's something that never ever goes forgotten.\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays everyone.\n\nEdit: still working on getting ideas on what everyone wants/needs will update the list asap.

{"saved":false,"selftext":"I'm not sure if this classifies as an \"angry rant,\" but it's certainly been bothering me for the longest time. First time posting here, but title says it all. I absolutely hate my family's business.\n\nTo give a little history, my family owns a camera, sign, and print retail store that is more or less trying to stay afloat. My parents are divorced and the store belongs to my Dad's side of the family, with my Uncle and Grandmother owning the lot (Grandfather and grandmother started the store however my grandfather passed away before I could remember anything). Anyway, the store is actually a nice looking place but as we all know, retail is going to shambles these days, so the only thing going for them is printing pictures, designing logos, and creating small advertisements like banners, flags, and stuff.\n\n[Also, I grew up with my Mom's side of the family for most of my life being dirt-poor and having to work menial things like landscaping, so I was never really exposed to the wealth that my Uncle and Grandmother possessed. So before anyone says that \"you're just a spoiled kid not wanting not to work,\" I understand the value of a dollar, trust me (boxed milk is awful)]\n\nAnyway they asked me to work there during the summer which was like an hour drive away from home (but sometimes my Dad drove me there because he works there too) to \"be exposed to a good job.\" When I got there, they said someone will train me on stuff because I had absolutely no idea about Photoshop, Illustrator, or any of the machinery, and said they would start me at $8 an hour. Fair enough I said. I'll probably earn more as my skills improve (BIG LIE).\n\n3 months down the line and I get pretty good at the programs and stuff--actually keeping on par with the other staff. However there was always a general disconnect between management (Grandmother, uncle, and two other managers not related to me) and staff. Management was super hostile and absolutely hated talking about pay, work hours, etc (probably because it was retail who knows). Some of my coworkers were amazing and I thought deserved better treatment. So when bringing up positive comments about other employees to my family and management, they always seemed to have something to complain about them. \"Well that's great but keep in mind they were also NAGGING about pay etc.\" Just awful people in general the lot of them.\n\nSo it was always super awkward to go to work every day having to look at the negative side of my family and how much of a monster my uncle could be some days. I absolutely hated going there more and more each day, having to face their hostility towards employees. Also, since I was getting more and more skilled (on par with other employees), they refused to increase my pay claiming that \"It would look bad to increase the pay for you because other employees would think you're getting special treatment yadayada.\" They also forced me to work these strange hours and do weird family things on the job which would otherwise be noted as unacceptable to todays standards.\n\nSo I'm in school right now and my Mother is moving close to me and said she could call up a few of her close friends to offer me a bartending job where she used to work before bad financial stuff hit her. She said that's the kind of place you could talk to people and it would be closer to where I go to school (I have no friends or girlfriend--also so I'd probably make more money than the camera store.)\n\nAnyway, my grandmother called me just a while ago and asked me if I could help soon after finals ended because everyone likes to order pictures during the holidays. I said since my mother is moving closer and offered me a cool job to allow me to meet people, I would train to be a bartender.\n\n*Proceeds to get yelled at by grandma saying that I'm copping out on the family business and that she's going to tell my demon Uncle and management that I'm too much of a coward to work at my family business and that basically I'm stupid for wanting to work in the food industry and not a glorious retail store*\n\nI just want a break from all this crap. If anyone has any advice on what to do I'd appreciate it. I'm sorry this was such a long one and possibly a \"first world problem\" type of thing.\n\nI should also probably mention that I'm 21 male at a university.

I pay all other bills either out of my paycheck or on credit, which I then pay from my check. So I'm in debt and contribute 100% of my salary to remaining bills and kids' expenses.  He earns between $15,000-$30,000/year more than I, depending on overtime availability any given year. He twice bought me jewelry on credit and then didn't pay it, leaving me to make the payments. \n\nThe list of mean and selfish things are endless.  Can't tell anyone because a) he'd kill me and b) I'm so embarrassed. \n\nWhen we were teens, a few weeks after the birth of our son,  he locked me in a room and beat me. When he finally let me go, I went to my mom's and called the police and pressed charges. We were apart for some time. He got court ordered counseling and seemed truly sorry.  We got back together and he's never hit me again but he's been very physically intimidating many, many times. \n\ntl;dr - Soooo, I know I need to leave. I know I do all the work and pay all the bills so if I leave, I know I can handle it. But for some reason I'm sick to my stomach thinking about it and get panic attacks. I'm embarrassed and afraid. And I don't know why. And I'm afraid he'll harm me if I leave. I'm afraid my kids will suffer. I'm 45 and scared.

Both men and women play games, it's difficult to tell when a man just wants to fuck, or is just saying all the right things.

Oh what a great question - go ask it somewhere it's still considered funny), and the game runs like absolute crap most of the time and I'm getting salty AF @ Psyonix when I try to play it. Somehow I've made it to Veteran but my actual skill level is not at all close to that from what I've seen other Veteran-level players do because it's a lot harder to learn while you're often lagging so hard you teleport around the map more than what would happen if Nightcrawler fought Deadpool.\n\n\nSpecs:\n\nMac OS X 10.11.6 (was the same on 10.11.5)\n2.4GHz Intel Core i7 (quad core)\n4GB RAM\nAMD Radeon HD 6770m @ 1GB VRAM\n\n\nspeedtest.net results (twice):\n\nPing: 43ms, 41ms\nDownload: 12.67 Mbps, 16.97 Mbps\nUpload: 1.88 Mbps, 1.93 Mbps\n\n\nSettings:\n\nResolution: 1024 x 768\nMax FPS: 32\nTexture detail, render quality: High performance\nWorld detail: Performance\nEvery other setting is off, and the slider settings are at default.\n\n\nIt doesn't matter if I start playing from a cooled-off and even freshly-rebooted PC, or if I've been playing a game or doing anything else on my computer, nor does it seem to matter what region I join (I've limited it to US-West at this point, as I live in the Midwest, and it's not helped at all). Of course there's a natural lag when I'm charging, but that's because of the great work Apple did (5 stars...out of 100).\n\n\nI'm not using any external hardware, Bluetooth is not on, there are no programs other than stuff that's from the system itself except Steam and RL running. It doesn't matter if anyone else is using the internet, though it's often a little worse when there's a video or two being streamed whether by the PS4 (I'm not a console player and I'm not switching over or even considering buying this game again on any platform other than PC, especially because of these problems), a tablet, or a phone.\n\n\nI've already talked to RL tech support and was told immediately that it was my graphics card. Yes, clearly the internet connectivity issues with the servers are because of my GPU; how dare I not consider that the WiFi runs through that piece of hardware and not the WiFi card which Apple installed just for looks.. Messaged them again after that craptastic bit of \"work\" from their \"tech support\" representative, again telling him in great detail that it's not a constant lag but it in fact is intermittent - some matches I'm fine, and then we'll have another go with the same exact players on a different map and I lag my ass off.\n\n\nIt's also not map-specific - I've played every standard map (not tried Rumble yet; looks a little too crazy until I learn better and don't lag so consistently). It could be because of customization items being badly optimized, but AFAIK Windows users have random lag issues too. After this second time I was told to play with port forwarding settings in my router (with Windows directions...after specifically mentioning Mac multiple times along with telling them in my specs that I'm using a freaking Mac) and verify the game cache (did so twice), which only seems to have made it worse if anything.\n\n\nIDK what else to do to try to make this game playable, and I highly doubt I'll be getting any useful response from tech support (though yes, I am continuing with that \"conversation\" unfortunately). Any chance there's some settings in files that can be tweaked manually, or that we can make a settings file with tweaks like with GTA IV?\n\n\nLove the game but I hate the lack of ability to play, and that's making me hate the game.\n\n\nTL;DR: connection to most servers sucks though I've set it to only US-West region, tech support was useless and blamed my gfx card.

She was awesome and we had a great relationship, I could have married her, but last year she decided to go to Vienna to finish her opera singing career, which I encouraged because it had always been a dream of hers. My current situation is a bit complex. I finished a Game Design degree (which was my childhood dream) when I was 21 (2014) and started working but wanted to be an entrepreneur because I've always been active with project and I wanted to get money, so I started an entrepreneurship degree in our native country of Guatemala (2015). I started reading a ton about business, finance, gamification, innovation, and basically fell in love with the career. I haven't been satisfied with my current school (I am the first class of the Entrepreneurship career they have ever had, so basically a guinea pig) and decided to learn a bit more through life. Started working internships in some huge companies while studying, learned a ton and got a great network. Well, her dream was to go to Vienna to study opera, and I encouraged her because the career and success rate in our country is basically non existent. I knew the long distance fan was there, but still went on knowing shit would eventually hit it. We tried to make it work long distance, but it was really tough. Due to the time change, I could usually just talk to her about 5-30 minutes a day (I couldn't talk to her after 2pm from my time zone). In January I got an amazing business opportunity with some really high end business partners and started working on that. I worked on my things and she worked on hers and we managed for a while but then I got deeply depressed and talked to her about it. By March I didn't feel like studying or working and almost got laid off as a business partner because of it. I mentioned a possible breakup as early as April, but we tried to make it work. I started getting major shifts in my life, in my work and studies. My overly expensive school hadn't satisfied me with their classes and felt mostly like a waste of time, while my new business opportunity became more promising the closer it came to reality (the business has been changing models all year and will hopefully, HOPEFULLY, launch around March, but it is a whole lot of cash for me. Meanwhile I've been working my ass off for free). I decided I would either transfer to an Ivy league school in the US for 2017 or try my luck as an entrepreneur without graduating. The uncertainty of the future was consuming me. What should I do? what did I want to do? I couldn't handle the pressure anymore. I'm 23 and she's 22, we're not financially stable to travel often to see each other, she's barely financially stable to keep herself alive and I've had to help her financially out of my own savings (around Q30,000 in 1 year, that is aproximately $4000). So, I would only see her for one month a year when she had to legally come back to Guatemala, and this was going to go on for at least another 5 years. I really do love her, and she loved me back, but on the fist week of November I broke it off. I needed to keep my mind in the game and told her I couldn't handle long distance anymore. I had to figure out who I was and what I wanted while working on my projects. She didn't take it too well, I tried to lay it off easy, but it didn't go well. I tried to break contact with her but she kept talking to me, until I really told her I couldn't talk to her anymore. What's more, she got into some legal trouble about a week later and she didn't have anyone else to talk to and she was scared to death because some who had stolen from her was trying to sue her (long story, and obviously without a case). Well, I listened to her, treated her to a fancy meal, helped her and calmed her down. After that she kept calling and texting, and I responded because I wanted to know she was well. Well, I talked to her today, and told her I couldn't keep the communication up, and that I needed some space.\nBut she wouldn't stop calling through every social media app or site possible. I had to block her all around, but now I feel an overwhelming guilt. I really want her to be happy, and I would love to go back to our relationship, but long distance was really consuming me in a time where I can't afford distractions. Should I have not blocked her? Should I try to find out if she's okay? I really care for her, but I think it's poisonous if we keep relying on each other for support. Did I take the correct route? Do you think she'll be ok? Please, help, the guilt is killing me.\n\nTL;DR: 5 year relationship was awesome until girlfriend moved to the other side of the world to study, I got really depressed, I was in a transitioning period and needed to focus so I ended the relationship. Ex won't stop calling, she hates her life right now. I'm really worried for her but blocked her because I thought it was the best and now I feel overwhelmingly guilty.","score":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"secure_media":null,"archived":false,"downs":0,"edited":false,"ups":4,"spoiler":false,"id":"5ftwm4"}

{"saved":false,"selftext":"If anyone is interested this is the final product of a few hours work and with the great help of /u/mitredditonme I finally finished it. Thanks dude, I appreciate the HUGE amount of help you gave me. I love this community, this is the best community on Reddit hands down. It was hard as hell to fit in everything I wanted to say in 5000 characters. Love you guys, I am hopeful for the future of Kratom and our community. \n\nDear DEA, \nI oppose scheduling mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, constituents of the Kratom plant (or in binomial nomenclature Mitragyna speciosa), as Schedule I drugs. It does not belong there. It is a very mild stimulant and mild sedative but a very helpful plant, with many uses. We need to conduct clinical trials and studies before making any kind of decision. After years of study, who knows what wonderful things we could find? It could be even more important than what the community believes it to be. However, we will never find out if it becomes a Schedule I drug. We should base all our decisions on hard scientific evidence before making rash decisions. The leaves have been used in South-East Asia for 100's of years. It is used as a mild stimulant, mild sedative, pain killer, and helps ease opiate withdrawal. Many people report that Kratom helps them with arthritis, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and fibromyalgia.\n\nI am [Redacted], I am currently a hard working Sophomore at Weber State University majoring in Botany and Minoring in Chemistry. Throughout my college career I have been taking Kratom regularly and I average between a 3.5-4.0 GPA every semester which demonstrates that Kratom is not affecting my memory, thinking or judgement.  I am 22 years of age. I have used Kratom for 4 years now, starting when I was 18 after I had a surgery to remove an osteocyte that was pinching my nerve cord in my elbow which was causing chronic pain and discomfort. It is an injury I received when playing Lacrosse in High School. The removal of that piece of bone just made the pain and discomfort worse as now the nerve cord in my arm easily slides over where that bone used to be and causes pain, on top of it being constantly strained. Because of this I don't have full movement with my left hand fingers, especially my small finger and a lot of the time my finger feels numb. This constantly causes pain and discomfort and I had an important choice to make after the surgery; take prescription opiates every day with adverse health effects but feel no pain OR find a healthier alternative that will help enough to alleviate at least some degree of the chronic pain and discomfort that I have without the negative health effects. I chose the latter and I am SO happy I did. Kratom has changed my life and the lives of many others for the better. Many veterans, the people who we should treat with the utmost respect use Kratom for various reasons and need it. Kratom does not ruin lives, it saves them. Without Kratom I would have to live with that chronic pain and discomfort daily or I would have to use prescription painkillers, which I do not have any desire to do. \n\nKratom is safe, you cannot OD on it, although there are reports of people dying with Kratom in their system along with other drugs, ultimately Kratom was not the cause of death, to say as much is like saying those people had caffeine in their system so the caffeine must be the cause of death. It is safer than alcohol and tobacco, which are both legal. The worst that can happen with Kratom is to throw up if you take too much, just as you would if you ate too much food for dinner. There are very few negative side effects, I only experience one on occasion and that is nausea. Other than that one negative side effect, everything else is positive. \n\nWays that I benefit from Kratom are the following: pain relief, anti-oxidant, anxiolytic, anti-depressant, weak sedative properties which helps me sleep, and more. While I realize that prescription opiates have their place in medicine, Kratom offers a much milder, safer option for people who do not wish to gamble with the risks that are often inherent in using prescription opiates. According to the CDC 1,000 people are treated for prescription opiate overdoses and abuse every day. Opiates do ruin lives, let there be a healthy alternative, keep Kratom legal. Kratom is known to be useful for recovering opiate addicts to get off of opiates, and stay off of opiates. While I have never been addicted to opiates and am careful of what I put in my body, I personally know recovering addicts that have used Kratom to help them with their addiction, let me tell you, it helps. We are in an opiate epidemic, a serious drug abuse issue in the United States, we need to do something about that. Kratom can help.\n\nIn conclusion, we need to study and regulate the use of the plant, not outright ban it. Banning it will hurt millions of Kratom users including honest hardworking Americans just like me and veterans of our armed forces. Please do not progress the war on drugs, it has been going on long enough and has caused a lot of damage.  Prohibition does not work, we witnessed that in the 1920's with alcohol. Thank you for lifting the ban and allowing a comment period. You have no idea how important that was for you to do. I appreciate the work you guys do, and I hope that someone reads this and it helps them change their mind. \n","author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_css_class":null,"secure_media":null,"archived":false,"downs":0,"media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"ups":2,"edited":1480574230,"spoiler":false,"id":"5ftx9k","distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qx0h","hide_score":false,"title":"Critique my Official comment","permalink":"/r/kratom/comments/5ftx9k/critique_my_official_comment/","contest_mode":false,"domain":"self.kratom","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/5ftx9k/critique_my_official_comment/","quarantine":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"num_comments":42,"media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"author":"StevenSmiley","is_self":true,"gilded":0,"locked":false,"name":"t3_5ftx9k","subreddit":"kratom","over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1480558404,"retrieved_on":1484291771}

Yes obviously I'm still lifting, eating right all those basic TRP stuffs. Now by no means this girl is a unicorn or anything, I just wanna try to make it work. So at the beginning of the relationship, I had total control and she'll always go out of her way to show her affection for me. She would call me often, buy me gifts when she meets me ( we only see each other once a week) and even buys the condoms. Recently, after 1 month into the relationship, she starts to change. She wouldn't put on her make up when she meets me, she wont buy me gifts and she wont listen to my commands anymore. Now i know this is disrespectful, I've talked to her about it saying that \"I dont like how this relationship is going and I want you to put in more effort\" all that kind of stuff. She said she is afraid of leaving me and want to try it work then I ask her, \"Do you still feel the same about me when we first got together ?\" she took 15 secs and answered \" No, but i'm trying to\". Have i made a mistake by being too available or was committing to her my mistake? As for now I really want to try to make this work but things are just not going right. I dont plan on marrying this girl, I just want to try to make it work for now.\n\nThings to know\n\n-We are both 18\n\n-We met on tinder(red flag)\n\n-I'm the 1st person she had a real penetrative sex with so i doubt she's on the CC \"YET\"\n\n-We only had 2 dates then after that all our dates are for sex at my place\n\n-We call about 2 hours every night\n\n-She used to giggle like a little girl when i tell her \"i love you, too' and now she have close to no reaction\n\nShe said the problem was that she thinks that i see her as a FWB thats why she losses interest. This may just be another case of my oneitis problems.\n\nTLDR ; LTR relationship doesn't feel the same about me when she first met me and is trying. Despite all that, I'm still in control of leaving her. Need advice what should I do to make it work cause i really want to. How can i re-ignite the feelings we had for each other when we first met ?","saved":false,"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_css_class":null,"id":"5fu1al","spoiler":false,"ups":2,"edited":1480560770}
