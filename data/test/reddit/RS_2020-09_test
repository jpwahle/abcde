It turns out I just had one cavity on the right, three cavities on the left and a bunch of plaque build-up. He tells me I need a deep cleaning and need the cavities filled. He says he can do half my mouth in one appointment, and the other half during another appointment. They quoted me around $300.00 as my dental insurance doesn't cover all of it.\n\nDuring the first appointment he deep cleaned the one side and filled the cavity. It took about 25 minutes. That was the first red flag. My father goes for deep cleanings regularly as he has periodontal disease and insists a deep cleaning takes much longer. It appears he was just trying to get some extra money out of me.\n\nOn my next visit to do the other side (today), the front desk tells me that he's only doing the cleaning today and I need to not only come in again for the fillings but also pay another $150.00. I was not happy and told them that's not what they told me last time. They said that doing three fillings and a deep cleaning on the one side was too much for one appointment. I thought I would talk to the dentist about it when I saw him. \n\nWhen I see the dentist and tell him the issue he tells me he needs to look at my mouth because he does not remember what he did last time. He gives me the numbing agent and proceeds to work on my mouth without mention of my concerns. Afterwards he acts like nothing happened and said I would need to make an appointment for the fillings whenever I am able. I left without making the appointment and the vibe at the front desk was that they knew they were being ass holes.\n\nMy deep cleaning on my left side took 15 minutes today. Is that even possible? Is this guy just stealing money? Is it normal to try to talk to a dentist and they numb your mouth so you can't respond and start doing work without you being sure what they're doing? I'm going to go back tomorrow when my mouth is better to give them hell.

Staring at a computer for hours leaves me sleepy and I feel generally unproductive, even if I've accomplished a lot in the day.\n\nCons:\n\n* There is significant risk in entrepreneurship\n* Estimated significantly lower pay\n* Long working days and significant dedication required. Large personal investment\n* Software development is only becoming more lucrative, artisanal baking is niche at best.\n\nIs this a huge mistake?

You can be male or female, that doesn't matter to me but please, be comfortable with writing both female and male characters.\n\nThat said, here are some things you should know: \n\n* I really like world developing and I feel like, for that, it's sometimes needed to play some side characters and even other main characters. This is not a requirement. \n* I only roleplay through discord. No kik or reddit dms.\n* Nsfw can eventually happen but it isn't the goal for me.\n* I'm comfortable playing MxM, FxF or FxM ships.\n* I also do some canon characters from fandoms like Marvel, DC, Dragon Age, etc. Feel free to ask for my fandoms if this is something that interests you!!\n* I have a preference for themes like supernatural, super heroes, steampunk, fantasy, etc. Slice of Life-y things bore me to no end so if that's what you're looking for I'm not the partner for you.\n* I'm portuguese so my english won't always be perfect but I try my best. I tend to write multi paras so some mistakes are bound to happen, I just ask for you to be patient with me, I don't mind you correcting me at all.\n* Faceclaims aren't a requirement but they are prefered by me. Just helps me imagining the characters better.\n* I tend to chat a lot to my roleplay partners so it would be nice if you'd be open to that too!

It has been an almost everyday thing for most of my life since then, multiple times a day, with me abstaining on vacations or times when I am out of the house for more than a day at a time. I have always been extremely awkward and nervous around women that I think are attractive, and not only that but I have never been in a relationship or even kissed a girl. \n\nThe few real chances I've had at a connection have been when my friends tried setting me up with somebody my senior year of high school (a whole semester of me holding her hand and walking her to class with nothing more from me), a female friend I had who saw how awkward yet attracted to her I was and still gave me many chances that I emptily begged for and repeatedly wasted her time with them, and recently this year a coworker who came at me pretty hard with yet again distance and no emotional reach from my end.\n\nI believe my extreme porn and masturbation addictions have not just defined my emotions and inability to connect with women let alone my friends or family, but I believe it is also the primary cause of my disaster of a hormonally destroyed body and the root of my other addictions. I smoke at least a pack a day, and I recently quit smoking weed again after doing it almost everyday since I turned 18 with multiple failed attempts in the past to stop. I am 6'3 and currently 215 pounds. I started to lift this year and treat my body a bit better in some ways. I have lean muscular definition now, yet I still have massively disproportional amounts of breast\/upper body estrogen fat that I can't seem to shrink. Having pecs with huge mantits hanging off the bottom is a terrifying look I couldn't imagine another human having to see.\n\nI've also dealt with folliculitis since I was in middle school, my legs\/ass being covered in breakouts nonstop almost the whole time (this has thankfully got less severe in the past year, comfortably wearing shorts for the first summer in forever has been pleasant to say the least). I also have some extremely weird knees that I describe as reverse bow legged. I don't know if this is also due to the hormonal fluctuation for all these years, but I've never seen anyone with leg structure like mine. \n\nI wanna state some facts about my past and present without going on for too long. In a few past jobs that I had, I've impulsively quit because of extreme emotional reactions to both male\/female co-workers talking shit and bullying me over how insecure and moody I can be. I met a bunch of new people over the past few years, who all now love making fun of me because I started isolating after getting out feelings for the first time in my life after emotionally ghosting on aforementioned female friend multiple times in person, then weird projecting at her about my insecure self image through text. I've masturbated at least once a day for 99% of my days since my first orgasm at age 11, with a lot of those days twice or much more. \n\nMy longest stretches in my life have all been in the last year, the longest being just under 3 weeks in July. I have been diagnosed with MDD\/GAD\/PTSD and am working towards a personality disorder diagnosis currently, I'm not sure how much these have been affected\/defined by my addiction as I've never had a real sustained period of abstinence from it. I've got some good looks from women before, yet I don't know where to go beyond small talk since I've been down this rabbit hole for 14 years now. I need to adopt NoFap and reach out for support in keeping it going because my body is destroyed, because my former friends won't talk to me and know how cringy and emotionally unstable I am, because I can repeatedly identify how much of a problem my porn\/masturbation addiction is yet I keep falling back into it.\n\nToday is day 1 of my latest attempt, I know it's not the only thing holding me back in growth and healing but this addiction has ruled my life and let me shoot my self in the foot in every way possible for way too fucking long. I'd love to message anyone who is on here to relate\/get advice, I feel there's a lot of personal info and experiences that I left out in this rambly mess of a post that could help y'all understand me more. I wanted to get something posted on here to motivate me to keep this new wind going, thanks for reading if you've taken the time to.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"NoFap","subreddit_id":"t5_2skrn","subreddit_subscribers":824654,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Trying to change my life","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/NoFap\/comments\/ikaaaq\/trying_to_change_my_life\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I had no plans to retire, but I've been offered early retirement thanks to the pandemic. The pkg consists of a year's salary (90K) combined with all of my other retirement accounts and annuatized for the rest of my life. Works out to an extra $500\/mo, total of about $2350\/mo. I'm 64 and can't take SS (another $2200) until 66.5 so my financial advisor suggested using 36k of 200k savings for 18 months until SS (the other half of what I need to make ends meet). I would also use savings to pay off my vehicle and other debts of 10k total. My best benefit is an excellent and affordable retirement health (and dental) plan from employer. I have 300k equity in my apt, worth about 520k. Mortgage is biggest expense at $1100 but plan to refinance to save $300 or so. No other major bills. I can make it, but it will be tight.\n\nContext is that I am a single woman, very invested in career and colleagues but I have a serious but somewhat manageable health condition that is starting to catch up with me, often making work a struggle. That will continue to worsen..The plan would be to stay put for at least a year, get organized and then move to a cheaper place to live. \n\nHaving to consider this has come as a shock, and I'm struggling with the prospect of ending my career somewhat prematurely-I'm an academic so not uncommon for people to work until 70. but I fear that if I don't take it, things could worsen, either health-wise or economy-wise, and I will end up in a worse situation. If I work another 2 years my retirement annuity will of course be less by $500, but I won't have had to dip into savings. Should I jump?\n\n***Adding for clarity: Yes, this is a tough call.

When I was 17 I had an interaction between a Fat-Burner and cannabis.  That day marked and traumatized my life.  My heart began to beat so fast and my chest hurts a lot , that I felt like I was going to die.  After that day I have become very hypochondriac.  Every time I feel something in my chest I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack.  I bought a machine to measure my blood pressure and I think it was the worst thing I did.  I check my blood pressure at least 5 times a day.  When I am very anxious, my blood pressure goes up a lot and I get scared and it goes up more.  On one occasion I went to the doctor and my blood pressure was very high and he told me that I could have a heart attack.  Since that day, I have become very afraid that someone outside my comfort zone will check my blood pressure.  The other days I went to the doctor and I got so anxious that when they took it I had 195\/120 (very dangerous values)... and then when I got home it was normal.  Do any of you have the same ???  Is your anxiety reflected in your blood pressure?  Do you always feel like you are going to die every time something strange happens to you?  Should I go to a cardiologist?

I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder back when I was teenager. I was prescribed medication for them but I stopped taking them after about 2 years. I managed to get the anxiety under control and for the last 5 years I only had a panic attack once or twice a year and when I felt anxious I could bring myself back down. Depression was somewhat of a constant I believe, even if I told myself I wasn't depressed I think I may actually have been. I had a relapse in anxiety recently that made me realize that I'm getting older and that I have so much that I still want to do but now I have to fit it all in what feels like a small amount of time.\n\nI just got my Associate's degree in Computer Science. This is great, but it means I still have 2 years to go before I get my Bachelor's at age 28 (this is if I do everything optimally). 28 feels late in life to finish college, even though I know there's plenty of people who do it even later in life. I want to try to get a job programming while I'm getting my bachelors so that I can earn more money and get industry experience, and I know that the younger I am when I start my career, the better I think I'll feel about it later in life. But I don't have a lot of discipline. I've always struggled with procrastination. Despite this, I've been able to do well in school, earning a GPA of 3.89 at the end of my Associate's, but I'm always waiting till the last second to do things. I think that procrastination is a large part of why I am in this situation and feel the way I do now.\n\nI'm not sure if I really want kids, but I know my girlfriend does and she's 24. On average guys have their first child at 27, and that's one year from now. If I wait longer that means I'll have less energy while they're growing up and I'll also be older when they become adults. But I don't know if I'd be a good father or if I'd be happy with or without kids. I don't want my kids to inherit my anxiety, depression, visual snow, and narcissism. But what about my girlfriend? What if I grow up and regret not having kids and I'm lonely? What if I did have kids and they turned out just fine and didn't inherit my health issues?\n\nI was an asshole for the last 10 years. I was narcissistic to the point that it destroyed friendships and harmed some people. I have so many regrets about the person I was in the past and I've only recently really realized just how terrible I've been and I've been making efforts to be kinder to everyone and spend more time connecting with people, but it's hard. I want to spend more time with people in person, but COVID makes that dangerous for everyone involved and I don't have great social skills because I've spent most of my time playing video games and not socializing as much as I think most people do and people are very busy, I don't have a group of friends I could meet with regularly in person. All of my current friendships are ones that take place mostly online, even though we know each other in person. \n\nI really love video games, and I enjoy them in the moment most of the time, but when I look back on my life I feel a lot of regret that I think may have been lessened if I had a lot more variety of experience. But I don't know what to do to make my life feel more fulfilling and give myself and others those fondly memorable experiences. I think that having a lot of experiences in life will make life feel longer in the sense that it would help alleviate the feeling of time flying by and waking up going \"where'd all the time go?\"\n\nI always wanted to learn piano and maybe even some other instruments like saxophone, guitar, and bass. \n\nI also want to make a video game before I die and maybe pursue game development as a career.\n\nI just have so much that I want to do and I don't have the motivation, drive, and mental health to achieve them and the clock is constantly ticking. There's also big life choices I have to make now that will impact myself, my girlfriend, and possibly future kid's and I just don't feel ready to make those decisions. I can never be younger than I am now again and it hurts a lot. I've been waking up with panic attacks regularly now about all kinds of things, but aging is a big one. How do I overcome my regret of my past, how do I make a better future? How do I cope with aging? How do I feel like time isn't passing me by and enjoy it all?

I'm 20 years old currently. I work part time as a barista and I'm a Junior in university (full time). I'm pursuing medicine with the current plan to become an anesthesiologist.\n\nMy assets: \n\n401K (work provided w\/ matching up to 4%): \\~$3,000\n\nStock Market investments: \\~$6,000k net profit (holding some tesla stock long term).\n\npersonal savings: $12,000\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI plan on keeping about 10k in liquid savings for rainy days \/ emergency funds. I've managed to get to a place where I'm saving consistently and I don't want my money to sit in a psuedo-savings account accruing .02% interest. I'd like to take the extra $2000 in my savings currently (and everything I'll be adding as time goes on) and put it somewhere where it'll accrue a good bit of interest over time. Neither of my parents are financially literate and we've struggled all of my life but I'm trying to break the mold and becoming financial literate and stable. I want to have a secure future (as secure as possible). Am I too young to start a Roth IRA? Should I invest my money elsewhere? I plan on keeping the money in the 401k and in the stock market for now. The 401k money will need to be transferred fairly soon though as I'm currently looking into jobs more career-oriented.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are some questions about Roth IRAs (I've already checked out the [r\/personal finance index](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/wiki\/index) ):\n\n1) Google states the max contribution for a Roth IRA for 2020 is $5,000. Does contributing to my 401k play a factor into the $5,000 cap as well or are these exclusive of each other?\n\n2) When I quit my job and have to move my 401k funds, can I move it into the Roth IRA? or a personal 401k account?\n\n3) Currently I'm in a low tax bracket due to being a part time employee at a minimum wage job, but if all goes as planned I will be an Anesthesiologist in the next 10-15 years. I know that there is a maximum yearly income in order to contribute to a Roth IRA, (google says $139,000 single and $203,000 married and filing jointly). Hypothetically, if I end up making more than the capped income, I won't be able to contribute to the Roth IRA correct? Where would I then have to put my retirement money?\n\n4) Is it worth paying a financial advisor (or those advisors that come with the brokerage) to manage your IRA? If so, what's too much to pay? Even though I'm not very financially literate, should I attempt to do it myself? \n\n5) Lastly, what brokerage do you use for your IRA? Have you heard of any good ones?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this lengthy post. I do understand that everything is subject to personal opinion and experience, I just figured I would try and gather more insight from those probably more educated than I am considering I can't exactly go to my parents for this information.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","subreddit_subscribers":14615535,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Too young for a Roth IRA? \/ General Roth IRA questions","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.85,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/ikadp1\/too_young_for_a_roth_ira_general_roth_ira\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

My spouse was raised loosely in the church. Their parents didn't attend but their grandparents did and took my spouse and their brother to church at least once per month. All of their extended family are very religious. \n\nI was raised in a strict Christian home. I was sent to a christian school, forced to go to church 2x on Sunday, as well as youth group and Sunday school\/catechism. I always felt like an \"imposter\" Christian, and I was always a little skeptical. Around age 16\/17 is when my deconversion started, and I officially started to think of myself as an atheist around age 20. \n\nAll of my immediate family and all but 3 members (that i know of) of my extended family are very religious. I met my spouse shortly before I turned 21 (I'm 24 now). \n\nMy spouse is a little more vocal about their lack of beliefs and criticisms of the Christian (and all organized religion) than I am. I've heard a lot of whispers about them pulling me away from the faith, or vise versa.\n\nWe had a religion free wedding ceremony last year at a family members backyard, which implied our stance on religion to those who didn't know. In my area\/family the expectation is to have your wedding in a church or outside with a pastor and include prayer. \n\nBut a lot of people have said to me \"I thought you were religious before you met spouse\" or \"Why did spouse pull you away from church\/faith\" or \"when did you get so bitter about religion? Must be spouse rubbing off on you\".\n\nFirst off, bold of you to assume I can't make my own decisions and choices and it must have been a bad influence. \n\nSecondly, I was over religion way before I met my spouse. They have simply helped me to become more confident in expressing my opinions and standing up for myself\/what I believe in. \n\nEveryone does like my spouse as a person and us together  but it's super annoying that they believe I can't make up my own mind and it had to be the influence of my spouse. \n\nThey can't comprehended that maybe I made my own decisions and found a partner that shared my lack of beliefs.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"exchristian","subreddit_id":"t5_2r95q","subreddit_subscribers":87630,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"No, my partner didn't \"change me\", I simply found a partner with my same (non) beliefs.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/exchristian\/comments\/ikaels\/no_my_partner_didnt_change_me_i_simply_found_a\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

Because of my voice problem, I don't meet new people, I never ask question from my teacher in class, and don't even participate in any speech contest (which is my dream).

She posted the name and the weight\/size of their baby.

Saying \"I can keep a secret!\" Well OBVIOUSLY she cant keep her mouth shut if it makes her look involved! I'm so glad I didnt tell her and I dont plan on giving her any information until I post on Facebook. She will get to find out with the people who I dont talk to on a regular basis. Play bitch games, win bitch prizes! \n\nAlso, my mom called her out for this behavior and she ended up calling my mom. My mom said the first thing that came out of her mouth was \"when is OP due again, any day now?\" (I never told her a date as I was never told a date by my doc anyway. Also, baby is going to come on her own terms anyway so why does it matter?) \n\nWith that being the first thing she said too, she is definitely not sorry because now she is trying to use my mom through me to probably post that info on SM.

So I finally decided to come in and do a trial. I was pretty nervous because I have zero experience with any martial art. When I get down there I do all  of the sign in stuff for new members and start being shown around. There are so many people there that I felt so out of place. I showed up about 40 minutes early so that I would be ready and familiarize myself.\n\nThe class begins and everyone starts pairing up. We're learning escaping back control. A blue belt named Todd taps me on the shoulder and says \"I got you\" and I felt a little more at ease. I watched the instructor explaining the moves, but it was hard for me to grasp. Todd was great at being patient with me and explaining what I was doing wrong. And I did alot of things wrong. But he was pretty cool about it. He didn't give me a pass though. If I wasn't able to get out of something, he forced me to remember what I needed to do. Now, I am a fairly big guy. I'm 6'3\" 190. That meant ZERO when I was wrestling with Todd. I quickly realized the strength of those submissions when we had to apply everything at the end. Todd easily negated my sorry attempts to get out of back control. And I felt what it's like to be a total amatuer novice against a blue belt. It is humbling.\n\nI want to commit to this, but I really don't feel like I'm able to pick this stuff up quickly enough. I don't want to look like a complete dork every class, so is there anything I can do at home to prepare? Outside of normal fitness stuff, is there any way I can practice moves at home? And what other pointers does anyone have plz. Thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: I had my second class tonight and I had much more fun! I still sucked balls, but I picked up  a couple of things that I didn't get yesterday. I'm looking forward to my next class.

I need some input of you don't mind. I am 40 years old, experienced in outside sales via phone and knocking on doors mostly in the b2b world. I have been working for a saas company but am looking for more remote sales with more freedom to make my own hours. I still plan on working hard, just on my own schedule. I see a lot of options for telephone sales in the health insurance world. Anyone have experience with this same scenario and maybe some tips? Also thinking about getting real estate license but moreso for a position in which I can work as a buyer for a company that does investment purchases not so much retail.

Other people hold someones baby and immediatly have the urge to protect it from harm, cuddle it whatever...I'm just angry at the person who's resposible for me having to be in contact with the child. I just don't like them.\n\nTherefor I tend to straight out say that I don't want to have children, dislike them and want to get myself clinically sterilised. And it always seems to be one of the following reactions:\n\n\\- \"How can you hate children? You once were a child yourself\"\n\n\\- \"You don't want children?! But they are so fullfilling and amazing!\"\n\n\\- \"You're still young. In a couple of years you'll change your mind.\"\n\n\\- \"You're just being lazy and\/or selfish!\"\n\nI just hate it. Seriously it's so anoying how, as a young \"woman\" you seemingly aren't allowed to dislike children. It's just frustrating as hell. I'm sick of people telling me that I'm wrong with my opinion or that it'll change in a couple of years because they are either to dense, to stuck in their way or to bias to (even for a second) consider that some people think different about children.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TrueOffMyChest","subreddit_id":"t5_2yuqy","subreddit_subscribers":940382,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I'm sick of people telling me that \"I'll change my mind about children\" or act shock about me not liking them","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.84,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/ikati4\/im_sick_of_people_telling_me_that_ill_change_my\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

Lucky all failed) \nToxic relationship (he didn't know he was doing it)\nAbusive relationship (I'm so sure he did know he was) \n\nThe thing that links them all together with the PTSD is that in all 4 situations I felt a lack of control. I had no control over what was happening to me. \nThat's why the virus has made it bad again. Because I have no control over what is happening. \nOne of the most terrifying things is that my boyfriend lives in another country, lucky he has been able to come over and stay with me for the last 3 months but is going home in a week, which is terrifying. I can't keep him safe there, he lives in a city. I live in a village. Its very different in terms of how safe it is, but I know he has to go back. He has uni and needs to be able to go, and his life is there. \nFor the record, the relationship is amazing. I have no problems with long distance. We communicate well and video call every night. I'm very happy with him and the distance isn't the fear, it's the fact it's the second worst hit city in his country. \n\nAnyway. I am rambling. I'm going to make some posts separately about my trauma. I'll probably split it into 3, group the relationships together as I really am not able to say much about them to anyone.\n\nIf anyone out there has any good ways for me to cope with my PTSD when my boyfriend has gone (he still helps over call but when he helps in person it's him holding me that helps the most) home please share. Any advice is helpful.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ptsd","subreddit_id":"t5_2qm0x","subreddit_subscribers":60140,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"A safe Space to share my experiences with PTSD.?

so I suffer from BDD (+ Depression, Anxiety) and have been seeing a therapist for it. It's still new so I haven't made much progess, but I go through days where I can handle my appearance and days where I feel like I look like a disgusting, lumpy mess and want to die.    \n  \n\nLink removed    \n\\^My face, First and Third are unedited, Second is edited Edit: I'm 22 and please ignore the two dots, they're pimples (temporary) :)    \n  \n\nI'm posting here to get a second opinion on my Tear Troughs (genetic, possibly worsened by poor habits). I tried going to (the best) cosmetic institute in my country for a consultation on filler. But this was during Quarantine so it was over video, and in retrospect I don't think the doctor I was seeing actually gave me a good consult on my troughs or overall appearance (she didn't appear to have looked at my photos prior to the video call), she just talked about how we should value our unique appearance.    \nI appreciated that at the time, but I hate how old and tired I look.I want to get a proper consult in person (after quarantine is lifted), but it feels like I've wasted money by doing two consults and I don't feel comfortable going to a different cosmetic institute because the attitude they give is very professional and they are very forthcoming about the short comings of filler and what not.    \n  \n\nSecond question, my face is lopsided, especially my mouth, and my jaw is quite rounded. Am I seeing things or is there anything that can be done to fix this like in the edit, or am I just stuck with what I have?    \n  \n\nOkay, so last question. I have mildly tuberous breasts and have been looking at a few different doctors. I was wondering if I could get some thoughts on the B&amp;A by these surgeons:    \n[https:\/\/www.drlayt.com\/gallery\/breast\/tuberous\/patient-2](https:\/\/www.drlayt.com\/gallery\/breast\/tuberous\/patient-2)    \n[https:\/\/www.drmiroshnik.com.au\/gallery\/tuberous-breast-correction\/](https:\/\/www.drmiroshnik.com.au\/gallery\/tuberous-breast-correction\/)    \n[https:\/\/www.drkolker.com\/breast\/tuberous-breast-correction\/](https:\/\/www.drkolker.com\/breast\/tuberous-breast-correction\/)    \n(I'll remove this if it's not allowed, I live much closer to the first two, so they'd be more affordable in terms of travel, but the price difference between Dr M (option 2) and Dr K (option 3) for the procedure is around $5000 (in AUD). I've talked to a woman who got tuberous breast correction from Dr M and she paid around $23.5k (AUD) including hospital fees and post-op bras and whatnot, but not including travel.)I'm not super comfortable with posting images of my own breasts, but they are kinda similar to the patient I linked from Dr L (option 1). But mine are more up-turned with a lower mammary fold (closer to a \"normal\" breast shape), and larger areolas.    \nI think Dr L's shape is my favourite, and judging from his B&amp;A he has experience working with breasts somewhat similar to mine. However, I'm worried about how a lot of his areola reductions appear uneven, while Dr M seems to go for more of a \"fake\" look with more upper pole fullness rather than a more natural slope (though that could be at the request of his patients) but his areolas are more consistent and even.    \nAt the end of the day, I'd do consults with both once I have the money saved for the procedure, but I was hoping for some second opinions, or any more recommendations for surgeons that have experience with tuberous breasts specifically.

More specifically, a friend to be there when ya need them. I'm sad about my dog for sure, but don't misunderstand, I'm not looking for you to console me. I'd just like to meet someone who I can have fun with, which will inevitably take my mind off this loss.\n\nSo we had to put my dog Sophie down on friday. Her kidneys were failing, and some kind of growth was pushing her colon down. The only other option available to us was not likely to work, and would most likely only put her through more suffering. We opted to let her go, so she wouldn't have to experience any more pain. She was very much loved, and I believe she was able to live a good life, which I'm glad I got to be a part of. She was both a dear friend, and a part of my family, whom we shall never forget.\n\n[https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1ByyIkDT-jovh9sIaHPtT5WP85CDCWc8R\/view?usp=sharing](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1ByyIkDT-jovh9sIaHPtT5WP85CDCWc8R\/view?usp=sharing)\n\nHere's a stupid video I took of me about to feed my three dogs, Sophie is the first one you see. Warning: cringey baby talk is plentiful in this video, so I apologize in advance for my obnoxious voice.\n\nThe following is what I've been posting on here the last few times I've tried, so if it sounds more upbeat than you think I should be, that'd be why.\n\nHere's muh face [https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/J4IRk6v.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/J4IRk6v.jpg) I hope my horrible ugliness won't be a distraction to you. Hopefully people get that reference and don't agree with me instead.\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/7tT8HFJ.png](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/7tT8HFJ.png) Here's a meme I made for ya\n\nPosted a few times now, just can't seem to find the right people. But that doesn't mean the right people aren't here, it just means that I haven't posted this when they're checking this sub. Hopefully things'll go better this time, but I digress. So\u00a0I'm really just a big ol' nerd looking for some other nerds, of around my age group, to nerd out about nerdy things. My interests are nothing special, but here they are anyways. I'm into video games, movies, a bit of tv, some cartoons here and there, and while I'm not huge on it,\u00a0I'll\u00a0do some anime on occasion. Oh,\u00a0plenty\u00a0of\u00a0YouTube, and memes too, you know, the works. Oh, and chatting by text is fine and all, but I would hope you'd be open to voice chat, as I think that breeds much better conversation.\n\nFor video games, I actually kinda hate multiplayer games, which ironically won't net me many friends lol. I'm all about single player though, big on the Nintendo side of things, if you like Zelda then we are destined to be the best of friends. I have been branching out more recently with the PS4 I got last black friday. Just played through the entirety of the Uncharted series for example. There\u00a0are\u00a0definitely\u00a0some games, like the SoulsBorne stuff, that I'd like to get into, but haven't because I'm a regular at Weenie Hut Jr.\u00a0Love\u00a0me\u00a0some\u00a0classic\u00a0games\u00a0though, I've had a blast revisiting things through PC emulation, and modding my SNES and Playstation classics. Sorry we can't play together due to my preferences, but I'd love to talk to you about all of it!\n\nI know it's basic as hell, but I love super hero movies, I can't help it, the MCU is my jam. It's not all I watch though, plenty of the classic nerd fare is also right up my alley. I'm just starting a rewatch of all the mission impossible movies for example. Dead serious though, I WILL WATCH HARRY POTTER WITH YOU RIGHT THIS GOD DAMN SECOND IF YOU ASK ME TO! DO NOT TEST ME ON THIS! I'LL DO IT, I'M FUCKING CRAZY! \\*ahem\\* Moving on.\n\nOkay, time for some real talk, the last 8 years of my life have been really tough. A family member came down with a mental illness and it upended my whole life. I'm 27, but I feel like I'm way behind the people of my age group, and I'm pretty insecure about that. There's been and continues to be quite a bit of stuff that's put me into a deep depression. So, do I have shit that's making me feel pretty sad? Yeah, but I'm\u00a0absolutely **not looking for you to be my therapist.** Not to worry, I got one a those, and she's a lovely human being whose helped me a lot. If we become good friends, would I maybe like to talk to you about stuff that's buggin' me? Also yeah, but that's so not why I'm looking for friends. I'm knee deep in the shit nearly 24\/7, I don't want to stay in that feeling, I want to talk to you about something cool and interesting, and remember what it's like to have fun again. I'm not a sad sack, I'm all about being funny and enthusiastic, doesn't mean I'm not depressed, just means I don't want that to define me.\n\nWith that said, let's talk about the other side of the coin. **I'm not your therapist.** I'm sorry if that sounds harsh, but I feel it would be disingenuous to not put that out there. Believe me,\u00a0I know what depression is all about. It's been my life for so long I can barely remember how it feels to not be this way. But that's exactly the problem, I'm in no state of mind to be helping you through\u00a0your\u00a0problems, that'd be the blind leading the blind. **BUT** by being friends, we can help each other, by lifting one another out of those terrible feelings, and escaping them all together by, you guessed it, having fun, and talking about things that don't fill our lives with misery and woe, ya know? Oh, that's another thing. I won't ghost you, and I mean that. But, that doesn't mean I'm obligated to keep talking with you if I feel we just don't mesh well. So I'm gonna be straight with you and politely tell you that things\u00a0ain't\u00a0Gucci. Although, the last couple times I did this, I think something I did was misconstrued as ghosting, or trying to get out of talking. Basically, If I say \"Hey, it's been great talking with you but I gotta take off. Feel free to reach out anytime, I'll try and respond as quickly as I can\" none of that means that I'm trying to weasel out of talking to you. It means I got other shit to do, or that I'm an introvert and this kinda\u00a0stuff\u00a0stresses\u00a0me\u00a0out, and I just need some time to recharge my batteries,\u00a0but\u00a0that's\u00a0all a\u00a0little\u00a0embarrassing to say. To a lesser extent, I also think it's a decent way to gauge how into talking you are, like is there gonna be equal buy in from both parties, or am I going to have to be the one to engage every time. Ah, that reminds me of my next big point...\n\nI don't mean to get political, god knows I don't want to talk to you about\u00a0politics, but I'm a liberal. So it doesn't matter to me if you're any color of the rainbow, or just fly that rainbow flag, it's all good with me. But, if the reason you don't have any friends is cause you're into some alt right shit, or various other fringe factions, that's gonna be a no from me dawg.\n\nNow if I'm honest, I'd rather meet some guys around my age, but I'm certainly open to talking with other types of people, here's a couple of disqualifiers though. First, nobody outside the USA please. Nothing against you guys, I've just danced the time zone shuffle before, and I don't want to do it again. I'm from California, and the hope would be that after the craziness of the pandemic stops, maybe we might even be able to hang out IRL as the kids say. Second, ya gotta be at least 20, please no teens.\n\nAnd I think that's just about it, if any of this interests you, feel free to message me or leave a comment. On one condition though, no short responses i.e. \"Sup man?\" Tell me a little about yourself, not asking for a manuscript, just like a sentence or two, maybe let me know about a common interest we share or something. This was a big problem last time, nobody seemed to read this part.

My plan is to continue with 401k at new company, open an ira, get my safety net set up, i have a couple good stocks that I will probably put a small percentage into every month as well..(mutual fund?)\n\n after we sell our house I will have close to 75k aft r we split it. My plan was to buy a couple acres and have a small house on it and grow food and get livestock overtime to so that when I fire I have the skills needed to survive. ( I'm familiar with realestate investing) so getting the land and house doesn't seem to hard for me.. (but let me know if you have better ideas). 75k would not get what i want so i would be financing some, and would play with the numbers when i am at that point ( maybe only put 10% doen or something.

I've definitely felt better but I've certainly felt worse and mostly I've been nauseous, crazy tired and repulsed by food but I haven't actually thrown up. I thought I was going to a couple of times but aside from a minute yesterday when I smelled something gross and had to run to the bathroom it never progressed past gagging a couple times. \n\nToday I had my first prenatal appointment, it consisted of only an ultrasound to do a dating scan, see the baby, hear the heartbeat and to get ready for the next appointments. My husband was allowed to go to this appointment so that we could see the baby for the first time together. I've been nervous about the appointment for the last few weeks and I was so glad he could go with me. The appointment went well, the doctor was so nice and we've got a healthy little one growing with a fast healthy beating heart, two tiny arms and legs with even tinier fingers and toes starting to grow. The little peanut even decided to wiggle around so we could see them moving \ud83d\udc95 Right then it all seemed so much more real and I finally let myself get a little more excited. \n\nFlash forward to tonight. I've not felt like eating anything all day. I managed to eat a granola bar when we got home and I tried goldfish but the grape sized human inside me said those were unacceptable. Around dinner time I asked my husband to please bring me a Jello cup. It took me at least a half an hour to eat that stupid Jello but I did it! At 7 my husband joined me on the couch (where I live these days) and we've been watching the Bruins game. Toward the end of the 1st period we were talking and all of a sudden I realized I wasn't listening anymore. I was sweating, the room was spinning and my mouth was watering telling me I was definitely about to throw up. I literally dropped the thing I had in my hand so I could run to the bathroom. I barely made it in time! I spent the next 10 minutes throwing up the tiny bit of Jello I had eaten earlier and dry heaving. It was so fun! Said no one ever! I'm never eating Jello again. I couldn't help but think it was a strategic plan from our little peanut to wait to kick things into a higher gear until AFTER I had seen them wiggle around all adorably and got even more attached than I already was. \n\nTiny human: 1\nMama: 0","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"pregnant","subreddit_id":"t5_2qwzb","subreddit_subscribers":86654,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Strategic plan little one...","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/pregnant\/comments\/ikb3k5\/strategic_plan_little_one\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

For context, I'm 15.\n\nBack before school let out indefinitely because of Corona, my brother let out a secret that he had lied the entire school year about his grades, thus failing him completely, leading to a retention in his senior year of HS. My parents were furious, which lead to my brother losing everything. computer, PS4, not his phone oddly, and other such distractions.\n\n\"But LiteralCreativity,\" I hear you say, \"They took his things away, that's fair!\". No, no it's not, let me tell you why that's not fair. A week passes by, everything is back in his room. Mind you, he made my parents pay up $200 for college application fees, and let me say if that was me, I would have NOTHING in my room except a bed and a dresser. This isn't a case of \"varied parental punishment\", where each child has a different degree of punishment, but instead favoritism. Typically, I'm the one being grounded, and everything always gets taken from me. Didn't do the dishes? Everything's gone. Forgot to mop the floor? Everything's gone. Busy taking care of personal pets? Took too long cleaning your room up? Everything is gone, room is searched, phone is looked through. And before you even ask, no. I don't smoke, do drugs, anything inappropriate like that is something I avoid at all costs. I just want my family to know if you're willing to fuck me over and violate my trust towards you, at least do it in an equal way.\n\nA week after he gets his belongings back, I ask my parents respectfully if they can please explain why they did that, and I explained clearly, but respectfully why I thought that was unfair and unequal. My parents hound me for being smart about this and tell me to not worry about it, and I say \"It's gonna come back to bite you guys.\" as a warning that what they're doing will punish them instead. I felt pretty bad about this, not gonna lie. I was acting like I knew how to parent, and that's not the case. I said sorry, parents moved on, life goes on.\n\nFAST FORWARD to a trip with my mom and younger brother to visit my mom's side of the family and low and behold guess who gets a text from my brother's spanish teacher saying he failed spanish and would need summer school. My mom. Guess who cries and throws a fit because it's more work on my parents? My mom and dad. Guess who immediately screamed \"I knew it!\" when she broke the news. Me.\n\nMy aunt suggests a low paying job (He works a nice paying job for an 18 year old) and my parents, of course, do nothing about it.\n\nSo here we are, Reddit. AITA for wanting my parents to enforce punishment on my older brother?\n\nNote: I don't get enjoyment out of watching siblings get punished, I just want my family to start enforcing as much as they do on a 15 year old to an 18 year old.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_subscribers":2745108,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA for wanting my parents to enforce punishment","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.84,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ikb9wi\/aita_for_wanting_my_parents_to_enforce_punishment\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}
