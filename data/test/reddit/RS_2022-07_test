I was born intersex, although not overtly. I was assigned female at birth, as I have a vagina and that was that, until I turned 13 with no sign of puberty even getting close to visiting. I was taken to an endocrinologist, who determined that I had some sort of genetic condition. I was told that I had only half a uterus, and that they \"couldn't find my ovaries.\" I was told I'd need exploratory surgery to \"find\" them.\n\nI underwent the surgery and they told me that I had no ovaries, they didn't develop, and that I would need HRT to undergo puberty. I was given estrogen and some other hormones for several years and developed some B cup sized breasts.\n\nLater, at 19 I requested my medical records and that's when I found out that during the \"exploratory\" surgery they actually removed vestigial testes. In the record it actually said that they did not inform \"patient or their parents\" of this. I also found out that my genetic karyotype was 46, XY which is commonly considered male.\n\nIt hit me like a ton of bricks and took years for me to deal with the ensuing emotional turmoil.\n\nNow however, in my middle age I look back and kind of realize that I always straddled a line between the genders. When I was 5 a kid asked me if I was a boy or a girl and I replied without thinking that I was 1\/2 boy and 1\/2 girl. \n\nWhen I was in college I had short, spiky hair, and dressed in jeans and a wrestling or video game shirt most of the time. I had a part time job at a medical library and was often called \"the little boy that works here.\"\n\nI stopped taking hormones later, at 25 when I had to have a hysterectomy to remove my half uterus due to it being pre-cancerous. After this I started realizing that in my head I have both genders, sometimes at once, sometimes not. My friends mostly refer to me as a spazcat. I have recently decided that I accept all pronouns (she\/her, he\/him, they\/them, or any others). I answer to ma'am or sir, and generally look however I want most of the time, I might wear a dress or I might wear cargo shorts and a video game shirt, it depends on the day.\n\nI wanted to share my story because I believe it's important not to hide something like this in the shadows out of embarrassment or concern for what people think. I will tell complete strangers in line at the grocery store all of this if it comes up. Most of my coworkers know or have heard from others.\n\nI am finally comfortable with me, as a spazcat.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"genderqueer","subreddit_id":"t5_2r1c3","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/genderqueer","subreddit_subscribers":51213,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My recent realization of identity.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/genderqueer\/comments\/vomrmy\/my_recent_realization_of_identity\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I'm also obsessed with Russia and Russian history (I consider myself a Russophile). Apart from that, I am a huge Formula 1\/motorsports fan. My favorite video game series is Gran Turismo (I've played them all). Other games I play include Ghost of Tsushima, Grand Theft Auto, Elder Scrolls, COD, Battlefield, and more. Of course, I love watching series. I especially like mafia\/gangster shows like The Sopranos, Narcos, Gomorra (currently obsessed with this one), and more. \n\nI am looking for a woman between the ages of 18-33 who can have an intellectual conversation.

My mom had 4 kids Jb who is around 22, DS who is around 19, KA who's about 2, and me. I'm 13. My mother was very abusive to all of us causing JB, DS, and I told move out. JB amd I moved in with my dad. DS stayed with their dad. JB works nightshift so he mostly sleeps throughout the day. One day me and my stepsister made too much noise and JB got upset. He came downstairs and complained. He then made a comment about me which was the exact comment my mom made about me every time she yelled at me. Eventually we argued and then he told me he was glaf I had been abused and that he wished I had just stayed with my mom. That crushed me and we had to take time apart. He then apologized and told me he regret what he said blah blah blah. Later I visited DS at their house and it was super fun. JB then asked me to apologize for him and what not. I did and DS said that they'd talk again after time. I told JB and he said he didnt care what DS thought and screw them. I called him out and said that was unnecessary. Then one day we had a conversation. First he talked about how he was upset I got to keep in contact with DS and he didn't. I told him the reason it was like that was because I wasn't a bully towards DS like he was to us. For a long time he had bullied and tormented us. That and our mother had gotten DS and JB to have problems causing the no contact. He then talked about how he was in a way upset with my dad because he took him away from our grandma. He also said he was upset because we couldn't stay with our step grandpa. The same guy who did very bad things to DS and I. He said he thought if he stayed he would've had a better life. Then he talked about our mother. He then AGAIN said he was glad I was abused. Eventually I couldn't take it and had a small breakdown. I then calmed down and gave him advice to help him move on. Which he obviously didn't take. I felt upset still but I didn't speak my mind because he was venting and I was trying to help. Eventually I talked about it with my dad and he told me more things JB said and did. My dad offered to help a lot but JB never took it. My dad had enough and told him he wasn't gonna give him any sympathy anymore because he made no effort to fix anything or move on. It was then that I realized how much brother was like my mom. He had constantly bullied us and I'd constantly receive lots of bullying which took a toll on me when I was really young. Then later on I'd comfort him and give him advice and yet he didn't do anything. He made me feel really bad about myself and no matter how much he made me feel bad about myself I'd never say anything. I decided I wasn't going to take it anymore because he didn't bother to change or do anything. All he wanted was for me to feel bad for him. I still feel bad because my brother went through a lot making him the way he is.

Then we had a discussion about me wanting sterilization. She didn't even blink. She just said to let her know 1-2 months before I want the surgery and she is happy to do so! I even remarked about how I've read so many horror stories about doctors saying no. She said that I am an adult who can make adult decisions. I'm 31. I'm waiting until the new year for financial reasons related to my insurance premium, but I am looking forward to receiving the surgery. I will definitely add her to the list once it has happened!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"childfree","subreddit_id":"t5_2qtwb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/childfree","subreddit_subscribers":1464355,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"So Happy!","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.97,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/childfree\/comments\/vomzbq\/so_happy\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

If I do manage to get hard it's around 60%. Even when jerking off I don't get 100% rock solid. It's only happened a couple of times, if I was feeling extremly horny, which makes me think it is possible, I'm just not able to reach it when it matters.\n\nI've been jerking off to porn since I was around 12, and never really stopped since. I think I may have porn induced ED. Sometimes I spend hours on porn sites to find 'the perfect video'.

Ever since I was a teen I've never really had random boners like other guys. I would get hard when jerking off, and that's pretty much it. I can't help but feel like something is wrong with me, with my blood circulation or whatnot but tests show my blood pressure is a bit high but normal.\n\nI exercise around 3 days a week.

I've been considering so many reasons, low testosterone, bad blood circulation, depression, porn induced ED. I just don't know where to start.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation. It's made me feel so insecure that I almost avoid having sex out of the fear of not getting hard, and I feel like I'm missing out on my youth. Should I just go directly to a urologist or doctor?

Great to meet you. Let's start out by getting the important info out there, so we can move on to more interesting things!\n\nI'm 29, with brown hair and eyes. I'm 5'10\", or 178cm if that's more your speed. I'm on the chubbier side these days, and I do genuinely mean chubby; I'm able to fit into L to XL shirts, if that's important at all. \n\nI'm a programmer by day, and cat dad at all times thanks to working from home. For fun, I enjoy watching YouTube and some TV shows (Obi-Wan and Star Wars Rebels are my latest viewed shows). I enjoy reading, walks and drives, and really getting to know a person. I'm not looking to get into anything super quickly, but I definitely wouldn't mind some flirting or general friendliness. I'm very open to dating, though full disclosure, it's been nearly 5 years. Some of that has been by choice, some not, but we can talk about that privately if you're curious!\n\nIn terms of personality, I'm ENFJ and Type II. I don't mind writing out long messages, but I prefer meeting somewhere in the middle, not too short but not a novel. \n\nSo, what am I looking for? I'm hoping to speak to someone that I could eventually meet in person. Canada is definitely easiest for me, though I'm also open to travel. I know English and French, but prefer writing in English; I hope that's alright! I'm not someone who really minds what someone looks like, since what lasts is someone's personality. I know that gets thrown around a lot, but it's true! That being said, I think there does need to be physical attraction between people to be into things. I definitely don't mind swapping pictures if we connect. \n\nDon't be afraid to send me a message!

Saw some recent newcomer posts and thought, as a newcomer, maybe we should drum things up a bit?\n\nI'm a 28yo queer bisexual woman. Single by choice because of current life circumstances. Left a long-term relationship last year and mom passed away recently, so I'm not the most emotionally available right now. I tried getting back into dating last winter and tried polyamory for the first time. It was a stressful experience but I don't regret it because I learned a lot about myself and my needs! It further cemented my decision to remain single for the time being, perhaps for the next few years until I'm 30. While my personal life hasn't been the greatest in recent times, my professional life has been great! So I want to focus on my career for a while. Other people have kids, I write books. My books are my kids :)\n\nMost of my friends are either unmarried or single, so that helps. I have a best friend who's also single and on the asexual spectrum, and I don't expect her to get partnered up anytime soon. Honestly, my dream is to live in a shared house with her and maybe some other friends. I could die happy in that Golden Girls scenario.\n\nAdmittedly, I am a hopeless romantic. I *do* want to be in a lifelong relationship someday, just not now. One of my worries is that I'll run out of time. Because ideally, if you want a life partner, you want to spend as much time with them as possible. Because my mom died relatively young, I often have the fear that I'll die young too and that I won't achieve everything I want to achieve in my lifetime. Which includes stuff like finding a life partner. But I don't think this is an uncommon fear. I think everyone is scared of death to an extent.\n\nThis is my Reddit R4R account because, while I want to be single for now, I enjoy a good conversation and friendship.

She is acting strange. Whispering when she is right next to me in bed. Things like \"yeah\" and \"I don't know\". Like she's answering questions. \n\nMaybe she is just talking to her secret boyfriend. I really don't know anymore. It's one of the two and I'm certain she is setting me up. My wife and her whole family is planting some kind of evidence and I have no clue what the hell or what I'm even looking for. \n\nThe reason I think and know this is because I'm a drug addict. I still get high from time to time. My wife is sick of it. She is tired of being hurt. Broken promises. She hates me as of today. 06\/30\/2022. I started noticing the odd behavior about a month or so ago. Everything is different. My wife, mother in law, sister in law and her girlfriend all just act differently around me. I always hear them whispering. Always. \n\nI don't have anyone or anything else in this life if mine. Nobody. Nothing. They all know that. So its easy for my wife to say I'm crazy. That I need mental health counseling. I have no proof. Just my word against everyone else. I don't have the cleanest record either. I'm a convicted felon with a drug addiction. I'm not the nicest person all the time but I would literally die for any one of my married into family members. I wouldn't even do that for my actual blood family (the few people I have left). \n\nMy wife would have died for me a few years ago. I know why she feels the way she does. The constant emotional damage I've caused that poor girl. Some physical violence but that was not a regular thing. It was not by any means a way to handle any problem that might have occurred in our relationship. \n\nEven as I sit here right now on the couch with my mother in law and my wife on the floor next to me. I'm in the middle. They both move there feet and hands and arms. They just act like they are doing something that just don't make sense how they are moving around. All fidgeting around. They might be just fucking with my head. I dont think so. I've been high and I've been sober for weeks and the same behavior continues with them all. \n\nA couple weeks ago I walked into the dining room and everyone that I live with was in their sitting around the table. My sister in law had her oldest son sitting on the floor and she was in the chair. When I walked in she pulled up a black and white composition book and kinda laughed and had a \"I almost got caught\" grin on her face. Like I wasn't supposed to see what was going on. I don't know what was in that book or what she was showing to her oldest son. \n\nI just really can't be sure what they are all planning for me but it's something that I can't control. I just want to believe so bad that it's all in my head. \n\nMy so called family is not stopping whatever they are planning anytime soon. I just keep doing all I can for each of them and hope I'm really fucking crazy. \n\nI also notice all the people that are in stores when I walk in to any grocery store. Just not normal people. Like they are watching me. Like I've done something wrong. Like law enforcement. I have not done anything that could draw this much attention to my self. That brings my theory of being setup by my family and law enforcement into my head and thoughts. There is no other explanation.\n\nI'm a drug addict fucking piece of trash that don't deserve anything good in my life right now. I will man up and take responsibility for anything I've done wrong and accept the consequences of those choices. I know something isn't right with my family right now. I know my wife can't stand me. I just wish for the best. \n\n\nThank you for taking the time to consider my thoughts, crazy or not, I just want one person to try and believe this. \nJames","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"setups","subreddit_id":"t5_2rx7i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/setups","subreddit_subscribers":34475,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My wife is setting me up","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.67,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/setups\/comments\/von692\/my_wife_is_setting_me_up\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I guess I need some guidance on whether I should cancel my MCAT this year, and take the rest of the summer to learn and solidify all concepts from scratch, do passive content review throughout the year and next summer start again feeling more confident or if I should go ahead with studying full time for the next 8-9 weeks and take the MCAT this year, and leave next year as a failsafe in case I don't do too hot this year?\n\nI apologize for the long post and really appreciate the guidance.

I've asked for advice here before, big reason being how my nmom totally despises my husband &amp; wants me to live 2 separate lives (one with her, one as my normal life with him), and some here have said they're surprised my husband has stuck with me through a decade of hell with her and it's borderline abusive to him at this point by not cutting her off. The baggage and water under the bridge with my parents vs myself and my husband are incredibly severe.\n\nSo here is the current situation I'd like advice with, I appreciate anyone who takes the time to answer, thank you so much.\n\n**1) Is it okay and normal for parents to hate their grown child's spouse &amp; refuse to ever see them, keeping in mind we aren't on drugs etc?**\n\n**2) I noticed it sounds like many people's nparent is still allowing them to live at home. Is it normal for parents to kick out of the house their grown child &amp; the spouse after 2 months, knowing your grown child has nowhere else to go besides a gross motel and frantically having to search for an apartment?**\n\n**3) Is it normal for parents to refuse making agreed upon boundaries with the grown child &amp; say it's their way or the highway with zero meeting in the middle?** \n\n**4) Is it normal for nmom to say if husband and I had a kid that she would expect to only ever see me and the kid and keep pretending my husband doesn't exist?** \n\nWe are 30 years old, the 10 years we've dealt with her haven't gotten any better. Husband and I sold our 1st home at the end of 2021 (huge mistake btw) and she allowed us to temporarily stay for 2 months with my nmom and dad (enabler, physically beat me as a child and has anger fits etc he's just not NPD), while we house hunted for a new home (hint: her actions put us in an apartment, no buying a house now).\n\nAlso by the way, previously nmom **kicked me out of her house at age 19** which sent me on a poverty spiral for many years. .. honestly, I should've disowned her instantly. Instead it's been 10 more years of pain.\n\nDuring the 2 months of us living with her, nmom and dad acted like they HATED us being there, rather than be happy to have that precious time together, as previously I was living 8 hours away and hadn't lived in their same state in 6 years. \n\nThis is the ONLY time I've ever asked her to give, over the decade **I've taken her on all expense paid trips and bought her all kinds of things** etc, it hasn't changed her at all. I've never asked her for a dime, never got help paying a bill in these10 years, never asked for anything period.\n\nSo during the stay, in front of my husband she would say terrible things about him, right to his face would say he was the worst thing to ever happen to me. Then after he would go to bed she would go into a crazy fit **saying she \"thinks he's on the way to 300 pounds\"** despite that she's obese, pretty much tearing him down from how he looks to how she hates every choice we've ever made, and just really cruel and flat out MEAN stuff about him, later **he told me he was quietly crying in the bed listening to her.** \n\nPrevious visits over the years, she's made him sleep in the car when I've tried bringing him for visits. He would drop off donuts for me or something and not bring her any and she would FLIP OUT and I would say to her, well duh, you are super mean to him so of course you aren't getting donuts. She'd say something like **\"well not giving me any sure isn't going to win me over\"**\n\nAlso my **golden child brother**. I don't know if he's NPD, but he's a troublemaker and likes drama and participates. Over Christmas, **my husband said a slightly distasteful joke** just in front of my brother and his new (much younger) wife, nmom wasn't in the room, something about it's his first time having microwaved chicken (my mom doesn't cook &amp; I grew up with everything from a box or frozen) and it's true, we've never had raw chicken that was \"cooked\" via microwaving. \n\nSo my brother when they go to leave, in the driveway **him and his wife tell nmom the joke &amp; other gossip**. Of course before doing that, they're all cheesy with us and saying how good it was to see us despite we only communicate on holidays, what a fake family. \n\nWell I hope he's happy with himself, because his little talk with her set her off into an on and off **extreme rage against us for several weeks**. Husband even kept apologizing to her about it, saying \"I'm so sorry the joke was super rude\" etc and she'd get even more mad.\n\n**She is incapable of practicing forgiveness for even the slightest offense.**\n\nOver previous years, I would come down by myself and she would always say she doesn't want to hear anything about my husband and prefers to imagine I'm single.\n\n**We gave them a little money** for letting us stay there, bought all our own groceries of course, husband is a neat freak so he did all the chores and cleaning there. \n\n**HE HELPED CLEAN UP WHEN SHE WAS VOMITING** WITH DIABETIC PANCREATIC INDUCED ILLNESS for crying out loud. I mean it's apparent her and dad are getting old frail and sick, both with breaking down bodies due to uncontrolled diabetes. \n\nNo action we do for that woman changes her cluster B disordered brain. \n\nSo long story short, **after about 2 months she finally went off the deep end and kicked us out,** made us needlessly pay for a (dangerous) motel while we had to last-minute apartment hunt. \n\nShe told us by text, when we had gone out for lunch, **texted us that \"enough is enough\" and we had to be gone by that evening**. No prior notice.\n\nI had a **full break down in front of her, screaming and crying,** and she locked herself in her room wordlessly until we were gone. I called my dad and he wouldn't answer, just **texted me later saying nmom is correct** and can do whatever she wants.\n\nA few days later after being forced to pick whatever apartment will take us first which is one way out of our budget, **I had to go back to her house** to get the rest of my stuff. And (this is predictable).... **SHE ACTED LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED.** She even took it upon herself to pack some of my things , which included private stuff I didn't want her to see in a million years. \n\nMy husband refused to go back inside her house to help pack, said he never wants to see her face again I TOTALLY agree. Nmom shockingly has the balls to ask **\"Why is he not inside helping you carry this stuff out,** doesn't he see you struggling?\" Like... jaw drop. This psycho b is beyond words.\n\nSo now thanks to her kicking us out after just 2 months and not believing me when I said many adult children go back home during a life transition for wayyy longer than that, **her actions made us have to get a 1 year apartment lease** rather than continue house hunting to buy another home.\n\nI was going to go visit her last weekend, first time since the blow out, I'm not sure why, I guess so if I have a kid they would have a grandparent (husband is limited contact with 1 parent, the other is deceased). Although **if we had kids she already said nothing would change,** she would expect to just see me and the kid and act like my husband is dead.\n\nAnyway, husband said it's \"unforgivable\" what happened and he would be extremely upset with me if I ever go back to her house. I agree, not to mention **the guilt I have letting her verbally abuse him for so long,** I have no idea why I have this urge to always give her another chance, So **I canceled the trip.**\n\nI took my SIM card out of my phone and **emailed her to say what she did was beyond repair** and the situation she got us in by kicking us out is at the edge of unforgivable. I asked for a major apology, thus giving her another shot.. she won't even give a fake \"i'm sorry\", doesn't do love bombs like most nparents.\n\nShe refuses to communicate by email, uses the excuse saying she believes it's my husband typing and never me, which is crazy and has never happened. \n\n**So I called her** from my new number &amp; blocked the number, which **calling her I guess is giving her control.** On the phone it was as predicted, horrible and **she believes \"no parent would ever let their adult child live with them after the age of 18**\" and that \"**most adult kids are kicked to the curb the day they turn 18 then that's that**\". And said **she \"did us a huge favor\" and that \"we should've gave her way more money than what we did\"** and REFUSED to say sorry for anything that occurred and the fact that it's her fault we're now living in an apartment 3X the cost of our previous mortgage and now not able to get a home for atleast a year.. **she literally said \"I have NOTHING to apologize for, if anything you both need to apologize to ME**, I am 60 years old in poor health with shot nerves &amp; I have to preserve my sanity.\" .....to me that sounds like **SHE is basically asking me to cut ties** with her.\n\nShe  said **dad has been crying** &amp; extremely depressed. I told her \"now **you have a tiny taste of how I felt all those years** right up until 19 when he would beat me and chase me into the woods and how terrified I was of his wrath my entire life.\" \n\nShe already said therapists have been on her side and says there's nothing family therapy could do.\n\nShe ended the phone call saying she will not meet in the middle, she's not sorry for anything, and if I **accept her terms (which is she does &amp; says whatever she wants &amp; wants to pretend I'm single)** then I have her address. \n\nThat's been it, that happened 1 week ago.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_subscribers":799702,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"On the edge of finally saying goodbye","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.9,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/vond6u\/on_the_edge_of_finally_saying_goodbye\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I quit smoking weed pretty much immediately after I heard they were interested in me, and it's a great job, so I really really want to pass. I think it's dumb that they still test for weed, especially since it's legal in my state, but it is what it is. Hoping that someone has insight into my condition and whether or not I'll be OK here, I'm not experienced in this area! Sorry if this is a long post, I tend to overdo it when I'm anxious. \n\nFor body type, I'm 5'11 (F), 23 years old, and about 189 lbs, so 10 pounds overweight but a good deal of it is muscle mass (I have a strong frame and broad shoulders). I moderately exercise daily. \n\nFor weed usage, I vaped about 2-3 hits on average daily for the last 1-2 years with the occasional 5-10 mg edible. I started tapering off 23 days ago (one hit per night to avoid WD) and took my last hit 17 days ago and I have another 12 days to go before my test, so that would be 29 days total without consuming any THC. I took some detox pills that contain creatine, cranberry extract, psyllium husk, and a few other herbs. \n\nAfter a week of abstaining and using the pills I was testing faintly negative with at-home strips I bought on Amazon. Now that it's been almost 3 weeks, I'm testing solidly negative, two pink lines on the test strip. I had my stoner friend take a test too just to make sure they were working right, and she tested positive (just one line). I still exercise and am still taking the pills just in case. \n\nAm I good? I'm so nervous. I want this job SO bad, it would be life-changing. Have any other weed-partakers tested at Concentra, and could you please respond with your experience? Do y'all think the lab test will be a lot more sensitive than the at-home one, or is it comparable? \n\nThanks sm for reading.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"drugtesthelp","subreddit_id":"t5_39wpk","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/drugtesthelp","subreddit_subscribers":21725,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Anyone have experience testing at Concentra urgent care?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/drugtesthelp\/comments\/vondku\/anyone_have_experience_testing_at_concentra\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

A little bit about me: \n\n• I'm 20 years old and a 24\/7 little with some independent aspects! I like coloring, reading, cooking, cleaning, Legos, Barbies, and of course, Disney (I know, we all do!) \n\n• I am 5'6, with brown hair and hazel eyes. I have multiple tattoos and piercings and am a little bit on the heavier side weight wise. \n\n• I'd consider myself a bubbly, lil bratty, excited little. I have about the same energy and attention span as a puppy! (We can talk more about that later 😉) I find I tend to have more subby attitude towards a lot of things. I just want to make sure my partner is happy!\n\n• I have a multitude of kinks, but my exceptions are (absolutely do not message me if these line up with yours) blood, pee or poop of any kind, diapers, beasility, piercing, needles, or permanent damage to my body. (I'm sure there's more but those are the main) I'm willing to try almost anything once though. \n\n• I value the traditional sense of family- meaning I stay home and cook and clean while you work. That being said I'm very energetic and would love a work from home option at some point in the future. \n\n• I'm 4\/20 friendly!\n\n• I'm willing to relocate but would love to stay in Michigan close to family. \n\n• I am going to college for business law in the fall, all online, but that is something I want to do and have already been accepted! \n\nA little bit about you and what I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n• Smart. I'm a grammar princess, I adore intelligence and proper grammar. I want to be taught things and learn something new everyday! \n\n• taller than me, at least 6 foot or taller 🥺\n\n• kind, caring and considerate. \n\n• I'm not looking for complete fitness, I'm 100% down for a dad bod, they're my favorite kinds of bods, but not looking for someone super big either. \n\n• you have to have hair (I'm sorry you just do) I'm okay with facial hair as long as it's maintained and not messy looking. \n\n• I'd prefer someone who doesn't work a lot. I require a lot of attention and love, if you can talk a lot at work that's okay, but with distance I kind of need clinginess otp. \n\n• over 25, but under 40\n\n• good with times, dates and reminders! This is an important one to me! \n\n• somewhat in the same time zone! I don't mind an hour or two difference, but I don't do well with time zone differences! Also preferably close enough we could meet at some point! \n\nWhat I'm looking for in the dynamic:\n\n• texts, calls and reminders. I'm a very very clingy little, I don't like it when time flies and we've said 2 words all day 😕 I am a super big fan of phone calls once I get past the nerves. I clean and move around a lot so phone calls help keep me on topic and task. \n\n• I need help with basic stuff. Preferably it'll become a TPE relationship at some point, but in the beginning I'm looking for help with dietary decisions, monetary decisions, budgeting, help dressing and brushing my hair. Reminders to brush my teeth, shower ect. Basic stuff most people do but I forget because of my adhd. \n\n• I love rules and ADORE sticker charts! \n\n• mainly I want a best friend. \n\nA few of my favorite books\/ movies: \n\n• Harry Potter (hated the movies, loooove the books)\n\n• Percy Jackson series (hated the movies, loved the books)\n\n• Hate\/love twilight. \n\n• my favorite movie is ponyo, but cruella and seeing red are pretty up there too!\n\n• Ive read, and own, the entire Sherlock series. \n\nOkay it's getting a bit long now. What's your favorite book or movie? I'd love to get to you know you and find my forever daddy.

Perhaps at work you are the boss, the team lead, or the one who does all the work when the other employees fail. Or maybe you’re the one who always takes care of everyone - family, friends,  or complete strangers. I’m talking about the one who is always doing for others and doing her best day to day but really just wants to be put over a knee, owned, and trained to be the perfect submissive where you can come home and not have to think about taking care of others or what needs to be done. Rather, you’ll know exactly what to do without the worries. If this sounds like you, you are already the submissive I am seeking. \n\nAs an overview of myself, I am a criminal defense attorney living in a centrally located state in the US. I really enjoy helping people on a day to day basis, especially those who are only in trouble because of an addiction or mental illness. Due to the nature of my work, and the hours it takes up every day and week, this is why I am wanting to start online - probably like 50-60 hours a week at the max. Outside of my workaholic tendencies, I enjoy video games, working on cars, movies and reading, cooking (especially eastern Asian food), hiking and traveling. I am 6’3 with brown hair, brown eyes and typically have at least some facial hair 90% of the time. \n\nAs far as my dominant non-vanilla self, I have been in the D\/S world for a decade now. It is honestly longer but I don’t want to count just rough sex in high school, so.  At the end of the day, I enjoy a submissive that is going to try and do her best. This is part of the reason for the submissive described at the start. If my submissive is willing to do her best and try then that’s a massive plus for me. My primary kink is control. This doesn’t have to be to a TPE level, but I’m certainly not opposed to that. Sexual and not sexual submission through control is a big deal. I enjoy controlling sexual things such as your orgasms and then non sexual things like day to day tasks and what my submissive will be wearing or what exercise my submissive will be doing today. As you could probably imagine, being a lawyer, I enjoy discipline and punishment from that. I enjoy training my submissives and watching my submissive abide by the rules, just as if they were laws. As I said complete control is not necessary, so don’t let that prevent you from reaching out. My other kinks are bondage, spanking, tasks, anal (and anal training), spanking, orgasm control\/denial\/edging, humiliation, TPE, deep throating, degradation and humiliation (but I’m fine without this as well). At the end of the day, communicating and our personalities meshing is the most important factor.\n\nAbout you: I am looking for an intelligent, enthusiastic, hard working submissive (or slave) who can hold a conversation with both educated topics like current events and also just be able to joke around and have fun. If we aren’t having fun then what are we doing, right. As I said before I really am looking for someone who wants to serve and is willing to give up control, even if they do not yet know how much control she is willing to give at the beginning. I would prefer that this person is located in a time zone where we can at least communicate during the day or evening. I would love a submissives who isn’t from the US, I just know it can be difficult and maybe not fair to either one of us. But I’m absolutely willing to try if you’re not from a similar time zone and want to reach out and talk further. At the end of the day I am looking for someone who is willing to explore her submissive self, have her limits pushed and communicate. This being said I’m not looking for a bbw, rather, I enjoy a submissive that works out some. \n\nJust to be clear, I am not looking just to get nudes tonight and play for tonight and move to the next. I am looking for something long term that has the potential to lead to something. If you’re interested, please shoot me a message (or a chat if your messages doesn’t work like mine sometimes) with your age, where you are from, your kinks and limits and, just for fun, a show you have been watching lately.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BDSMpersonals","subreddit_id":"t5_2smyd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BDSMpersonals","subreddit_subscribers":237789,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"30 [M4F] Sit back and relax, I’ll take it from here. #online to start","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BDSMpersonals\/comments\/vongi7\/30_m4f_sit_back_and_relax_ill_take_it_from_here\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Does this mean I will need to get it taken out, or will they adjust it? and will a new provider even do this on my first appointment?

I'm a new viewer of your channel and just discovered your creepy stories and so I was like hey, I have a shit ton from thus house I used to live in. This was like 2 years ago (I'm 16 rn) Im going to start off light with my typical sleep paralysis. \n\nSo my mum had recently broken up with my dad and so we had to move in with my grandma. Immediately when we moved in here I had an odd feeling but I didnt care as long as we had a place to sleep. My grandma had a dog and I had brought my cat along too, both animals REFUSED to step in the room my grandma and I were sharing. \n\nIt was fine for the first couple of months but one night after falling asleep I had woken up. I had thought it was because I needed a drinkk of water or needed to pee so i tried to get up, but I dont know if you know this but when you are in sleep paralysis you're paralyzed so I obviously couldnt move. All I could do was blink and look around. I was a little confused obviously and so I looked around before spotting someone out of the corner of my eye. It was a little girl, around 7 or 8, she had long matted dirty blonde hair that covered the entirety of her face. She wore a old looking gown and it had a bunch of holes in it, her skin looked like it was burnt or something. When i finally made eye contact with her face she tilted her head up before locking eyes with me. I felt my heart quicken as her mouth began to widen, it was wider than humanly possible, like it went down to about her chest and her jaw was crooked. She then screamed out, \"DONT LOOK AT ME!\" Before she ran full blown at me, attacking me. That was when I woke up and I slept in the living room that night. \n\nAnother experience I had experienced was a nightmare. I was in the apartment when my school had emailed me to come to the school and return my chromebook because it was the last day of school and we were online due to covid. And so I began my trek to the school which was only a 10 minute walk away. I finally ended up at school and passed through the hall before seeing my friend Scarlett(different name due to privacy) she greeted me saying how happy she was to see me and I was like yeah it's nice to see you too. We chit chatted for a bit when I spotted the girl from my sleep paralysis, I automatically furrowed my eyebrows and asked Scarlett if she could see the girl too. When I looked at Scarlett's face it was the exact same as the little girls and she grabbed my arm. I immediately pulled away from her before running away. Everyone's faces morphed into the same face as the little girl and I ran into a red room which had a stair case. I ran down the stairs quickly before spotting the exit door. I ran out them and everyone began chasing me. I was freaking out because I can't run because of asthma and so I kept stopping because I couldn't breathe. After stopping and trying to run before tripping everyone tackled me before I woke up. When i woke up my mum was sitting beside me asking me what was wrong since I was screaming when she got there. I just explained that a bunch of people were chasing me. And then suddenly her face morphed too and she said, \"dont think you can get away so easily.\" Before I woke up for real. \nScariest shit ever omg.

A little bit about me: \n\n• I'm 20 years old and a 24\/7 little with some independent aspects! I like coloring, reading, cooking, cleaning, Legos, Barbies, and of course, Disney (I know, we all do!) \n\n• I am 5'6, with brown hair and hazel eyes. I have multiple tattoos and piercings and am a little bit on the heavier side weight wise. \n\n• I'd consider myself a bubbly, lil bratty, excited little. I have about the same energy and attention span as a puppy! (We can talk more about that later 😉) I find I tend to have more subby attitude towards a lot of things. I just want to make sure my partner is happy!\n\n• I have a multitude of kinks, but my exceptions are (absolutely do not message me if these line up with yours) blood, pee or poop of any kind, diapers, beasility, piercing, needles, or permanent damage to my body. (I'm sure there's more but those are the main) I'm willing to try almost anything once though. \n\n• I value the traditional sense of family- meaning I stay home and cook and clean while you work. That being said I'm very energetic and would love a work from home option at some point in the future. \n\n• I'm 4\/20 friendly!\n\n• I'm willing to relocate but would love to stay in Michigan close to family. \n\n• I am going to college for business law in the fall, all online, but that is something I want to do and have already been accepted! \n\nA little bit about you and what I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n• Smart. I'm a grammar princess, I adore intelligence and proper grammar. I want to be taught things and learn something new everyday! \n\n• taller than me, at least 6 foot or taller 🥺\n\n• kind, caring and considerate. \n\n• I'm not looking for complete fitness, I'm 100% down for a dad bod, they're my favorite kinds of bods, but not looking for someone super big either. \n\n• you have to have hair (I'm sorry you just do) I'm okay with facial hair as long as it's maintained and not messy looking. \n\n• I'd prefer someone who doesn't work a lot. I require a lot of attention and love, if you can talk a lot at work that's okay, but with distance I kind of need clinginess otp. \n\n• over 25, but under 40\n\n• good with times, dates and reminders! This is an important one to me! \n\n• somewhat in the same time zone! I don't mind an hour or two difference, but I don't do well with time zone differences! Also preferably close enough we could meet at some point! \n\nWhat I'm looking for in the dynamic:\n\n• texts, calls and reminders. I'm a very very clingy little, I don't like it when time flies and we've said 2 words all day 😕 I am a super big fan of phone calls once I get past the nerves. I clean and move around a lot so phone calls help keep me on topic and task. \n\n• I need help with basic stuff. Preferably it'll become a TPE relationship at some point, but in the beginning I'm looking for help with dietary decisions, monetary decisions, budgeting, help dressing and brushing my hair. Reminders to brush my teeth, shower ect. Basic stuff most people do but I forget because of my adhd. \n\n• I love rules and ADORE sticker charts! \n\n• mainly I want a best friend. \n\nA few of my favorite books\/ movies: \n\n• Harry Potter (hated the movies, loooove the books)\n\n• Percy Jackson series (hated the movies, loved the books)\n\n• Hate\/love twilight. \n\n• my favorite movie is ponyo, but cruella and seeing red are pretty up there too!\n\n• Ive read, and own, the entire Sherlock series. \n\nOkay it's getting a bit long now. What's your favorite book or movie? I'd love to get to you know you and find my forever daddy. I'm so tired of looking 😭","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AgeGapPersonals","subreddit_id":"t5_t04ga","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AgeGapPersonals","subreddit_subscribers":64001,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"20 [f4m] #Michigan little looking for her forever daddy","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.63,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AgeGapPersonals\/comments\/vons7y\/20_f4m_michigan_little_looking_for_her_forever\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

In this past month I have landed a new higher paying job and working on paying off my major debt (my car), and eventually planning on getting my own place. I find myself looking at friends of mine starting their lives and I can't help but see my own personal life stalled. I have 2 friends of mine engaged one is getting married in less than a month and the other next year. Looking at myself in my mid-30's and never had a girlfriend I had found myself into a binge eating frenzy for years sometimes I can control it, but other times I have just ordered food for two people and I am eating it just to cope. I feel like the conversations I have with friends are about their happiness and deep down I am happy for them, but I wish I had a girlfriend that would love me and show me affection, but I have come to terms with just being alone. The pain is un-describable like being hit by a train. This last weekend I hung out with friends and met a woman but I don't feel comfortable talking to women at bars, and my friends think I am gay because I don't have an interest in casual sex or one-night stands. I am just alone and the pain is not going away I had a goal to get married and have a child before I am 30, but I am past 30 just turned 37 and it bothers me.

Great to meet you. Let's start out by getting the important info out there, so we can move on to more interesting things!\n\nI'm 29, with brown hair and eyes. I'm 5'10\", or 178cm if that's more your speed. I'm on the chubbier side these days, and I do genuinely mean chubby; I'm able to fit into L to XL shirts, if that's important at all. \n\nI'm a programmer by day, and cat dad at all times thanks to working from home. For fun, I enjoy watching YouTube and some TV shows (Obi-Wan and Star Wars Rebels are my latest viewed shows). I enjoy reading, walks and drives, and really getting to know a person. I'm not looking to get into anything super quickly, but I definitely wouldn't mind some flirting or general friendliness. I'm very open to dating, though full disclosure, it's been nearly 5 years. Some of that has been by choice, some not, but we can talk about that privately if you're curious!\n\nIn terms of personality, I'm ENFJ and Type II. I don't mind writing out long messages, but I prefer meeting somewhere in the middle, not too short but not a novel. \n\nSo, what am I looking for? I'm hoping to speak to someone that I could eventually meet in person. Canada is definitely easiest for me, though I'm also open to travel. I know English and French, but prefer writing in English; I hope that's alright! I'm not someone who really minds what someone looks like, since what lasts is someone's personality. I know that gets thrown around a lot, but it's true! That being said, I think there does need to be physical attraction between people to be into things. I definitely don't mind swapping pictures if we connect. \n\nDon't be afraid to send me a message!
