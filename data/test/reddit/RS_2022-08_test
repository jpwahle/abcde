She is very cute and we always like to pick on each other in a playful way. I've never really talked to her or said too much about her doing BJJ but 2 nights ago I was messing with her and joking saying I could beat her. It went on for about 10 minutes until she said let's have a wrestling\/grappling match. I agreed because I thought I since I'm 6'1 175lbs that I could just pin her to the ground. Boy was I wrong.... we decided to do 3 rounds and the first round she got me in a gullitine and I tapped. 2nd round she got me in am armbar and I tapped. The last round first she got into a position whwre her butt was in my face and she was laughing and making jokes then she got me in a triangle choke and was smiling at me as I tapped. I lost all 3 rounds and I'm not one to get all toxic and be over masculine but I just don't know what I felt. On the ride home I could barely look at her and when I would talk I would stutter or stumble over my words and get nervous, she would giggle or smile when that happend. I haven't really said too much to her since those 2 nights ago, but I really want to because she is so sweet and cute. She offered to cuddle me because I seemed sad but I declined.

I've been doing my best since then, paying my bills, working up to 4 jobs at a time, making ends meet. I'm still poor. I live with my parents.

I see so many lesbians on dating apps requiring their partners to have a certain credit score, or a house, or be financially independent from everybody and everything, or have no debt, etc.\nMy question is, can I date?

There is this family who live near me and when I say they are crazy I mean crazy , everybody knows them for the wrong reasons and even with people who live nowhere near me know them. So anyway during that heatwave in April I was out sitting sunbathing in my front garden and a man about early 30s got out of a car asking for the sake of the story we will call the family the smiths , I was confused and shouted for my mum , the man looked scared and like he had see a ghost but that just left my head after a couple of hours I thought it was strange but moved on from it pretty quickly , the next week the same thing happened after that and a few days later and constantly strangers coming to my door , suddenly it stopped and no more strangers my 16 year old brain thought “Maybe it’s parcels” but overhearing my mum talk on the phone I knew then it was more than “parcels” it was the good stuff , let your brain figure that out then for some more context my auntie lives next door to me and her back garden connects with “The smiths” back garden and she was sleeping one night listening to the what was the busy road silent when she started to hear banging and voices , this was also very late at night 2\/3pm and so she decided to get up and look what was going on out the window which glances over the back garden at the very bottom she saw a talk dark figure , at this point she locked the doors and stayed with us a few days later I was up at 3am I would also struggle to sleep and it was one of those nights I went to to to the bathroom and I came out and there the exact same man was standing looking in my window staring right at me (most bathrooms in Ireland are downstairs) and I froze I had my earphones in but I have never let a scream out like my mum and my sisters came rushing out and my mum was straight on the phone to the police , shaken up talking to the police they took my statement and were on their way , nothing else ever came from that or appeared, the strangers coming to my door stopped the strange man stopped and two years later I will still never understand why , my house they have never really spoke to my family so it will always be strange to me , so yeah next time you pass a small village , there is always more which lies beneath what is shown","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"LetsReadOfficial","subreddit_id":"t5_fp7ae","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/LetsReadOfficial","subreddit_subscribers":16084,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Lockdown nightmare","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LetsReadOfficial\/comments\/wd33ex\/lockdown_nightmare\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

She is my third Tantaly doll, and my first 1:1 scale full torso. I do have Louise who is also 1:1, but she is a hip. And I have Britney who is a full torso, but scaled down and truncated. \n\nCandice has been around long enough for most to know what she brings to the table, so I don't want to inform the community of what they already know. The pressing matters I wanted to experience with this doll is: \n\n* Is she truly 1:1?\n* Are the breasts as hard as people say?\n* Is she truly a full sized Louise with an updated labia?\n* How will the weight feel?\n* How immersive is the experience?\n* Will she be more difficult to clean and maintain?\n* How can she be improved?\n\n\\- Candice is truly a 1:1. I have seen several statements about her being a bit on the smaller side. This is true, but not in the sense that makes her a micro doll. I'm 5'10 and when sitting side by side with Candice, her size is comparable with my own as my shoulder height in this position is only about 2 inches taller than Candice's. This is a great measuring tool since both you and Candice are in the exact same position on the bed, bench, or whatever you're sitting on (both you and her are in a sitting position)\n\n\\- The breasts unfortunately are as hard they say. They are nice. You can squeeze them, but they are not how breasts that look like that would feel on an actual woman. A woman with a boob job, yes. But Candice's breasts look completely natural.\n\n\\- I was absolutely correct that Candice is basically a full size Louise. I just needed to be physically sure they are. I compared the two, and while there are slight differences, you need to put both dolls together in order to see what they are. Both dolls have exceptionally wonderful asses, that have to be experienced to truly know how awesome they are.\n\n\\- Louise is about 22lbs, and Britney was my next size up weighing in at 30lbs. Jumping up to 43lbs with Candice was a concern. Turns out it's not bad at all. There are some ways I can maneuver Britney during sex that are no longer possible with Candice without risking damage to her or injury to myself (already felt my wrist tweak a bit when doing so). This just means I have to maneuver her differently, which actually makes the experience more immersive.\n\n\\- Having sex with Candice was ridiculous. I can only think of one girl I was with that was as hot and fit as Candice is. The only drawback I have was how hard her breasts are when in missionary position. A bit disappointing actually considering this was my first missionary with a full-sized doll. However. And this is a BIG however. Doggie style with Candice is just fucking mind blowing. Her ass is Sooooooooo good, and softer than I thought it would be. Her ass will also get more soft and jiggly over time, so this position is only going to get even more intense. \n\n\\- Candice isn't any more difficult to clean than Louise or Britney. Weight holds no bearing when it comes to showering with the dolls because they are laid down in the tub. The main concern comes from a quick rinse, which involves placing them on a surface such as the bathroom sink. There was no issues here, but a leg doll will likely be a problem. All over powdering is also just as easy as any other Tantaly doll I've owned.\n\n\\- As for improvements. In regards to a Candice 2.0, I will echo what I said in the other thread and recommend that you do absolutely nothing to change the overall shape and aesthetic of the current Candice. If you lengthen her, increase the boob size, give her legs, then you're just creating another doll. It is imperative that you maintain the current design! The idea should be to take the current Candice off of the market, and replaced with her updated version much like you have when you updated the labia on her. Update the skin to current TPE standards you guys use, soften those breasts,  and add a more bendable skeleton, and that is literally it. A big issue customers are having with Aurora 2.0 is several features of the Aurora 1.0 were not retained, and now Aurora 1.0 is no longer available for purchase. \n\nI've mentioned multiple times now, but will say it again: In order to meet the demand for a slightly larger Candice with bigger boobs, you just need to release a full-torso with Rosie's proportions. For this I recommend marrying Rosie's ass to Jennifer's tits. Do not give her bendable legs. Like Candice, she would technically be an Ass doll despite having ridiculous tits as well, so her backside should be where the emphasis is placed. \n\n====================================\n\nTo close, Candice came as advertised, and then some. While I still have yet to experience one of Tantaly's leg dolls, I have issues with those dolls based on the pictures I have seen with the exception of Monroe who for some reason doesn't suffer the square shape, or inversion that the other leg dolls do when bent over. Candice however in terms of aesthetics, is Tantaly's most perfect doll they have. When you look at her perfect stomach, natural looking tits, and that absolutely perfectly sculpted backside of hers, I feel like I am fucking a piece of artwork. Truly.\n\nThank you Tantaly for a truly mind blowing experience. 8\/10","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"tantaly","subreddit_id":"t5_2t4m29","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/tantaly","subreddit_subscribers":4075,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My Candice review: Bravo Tantaly!","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tantaly\/comments\/wd3735\/my_candice_review_bravo_tantaly\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

This plan would be combined with contribution into RRSP up to 35k on 4 years to have a tax break. After 5 years, I would withdraw the funds from RRSP (IRA in the US) as well as pulling some of my equity to pay my downpayment for the place that I will live in (home plan). I find this plan to be conservative as rate is VERY low and I wouldn’t save that much (1k per year), however, it would ‘lower’ the stress of having debt. \n\nNote: In Canada, I am allowed to withdraw funds from retirement account, up to 35k cad no taxes to pay for my first home that i would live in. However, i need to pay back the amount within 15 years. \n\nPlan B \n\nUse the cash as a downpayment for a second rental property: \n\nThe plan is to acquire a second rental property. I don’t think I would have problems with pre-approval, as I will have parents to cosign with me (I will be the one making the monthly payment). Although, interests are higher, they would be tax deductible, so I would balance out with other property. I find this plan to be less conservative, as if I don’t find tenants for both properties, It wouldn’t be so fun. However, I don’t mind pitching in with whatever rent I can get, since I mentioned my expenses are very low. \n\nI apologize if this post offends anyone. I know I have a great privilege of living with my parents. \n\nTL;DR: I have 100k cash and do not know how to use them. Dumping a lump sum on my current rental property with a low rate or put as a down payment for a second rental property.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/personalfinance","subreddit_subscribers":16251176,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"cash available - Lump sum on current mortgage or Downpayment on a second rental","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.66,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/wd38z2\/cash_available_lump_sum_on_current_mortgage_or\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

When I looked it up, it said having a variation more than 40 points between systolic\/diastolic is indicative of heart issues. I am 34 and healthy btw. After that, I went to Walmart and used their actual arm BP reader (not wrist) and my stupid boyfriend started poking me\/antagonizing WHILE the cuff was tightening on my arm. My BP read 150\/79 and my heart rate was 140. So here I freaked out cause not only did the wrist machine say that, but this machine did too. So I tried it 5 min later and my BP was 124\/77 and pulse was 90. So now I am not sure what to think cause even tho I think my BF screwed up the reading, I'm not sure if him tickling me would screw up the variance between the two numbers (like happened at the dentist office).

A month or so ago I saw SFV on sale on Steam and figured this was finally the time. I pick it up and ordered a Qanba Drone. To be clear I have no real fighting game experience so I'm basically starting from scratch. I'm 35 hours into the game with Ryu given 4 or 5 of those hours were just getting started and playing through the story. I've been working my way through Gief's gym and I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of the basics but now with 50 or so ranked matches I'm worried I'm not putting my time into the right things. \n\nI've been using Ceelow's formula from his Rookie to Silver video with some success but I still feel like I'm missing something. A third of my matches feel competitive, a third feel like I'm competing but the other player is just better so I end up losing in the end and a third don't feel like I'm not even playing at all. The clarify on the last third, I literally can't do anything but block. As soon as I feel like I have a chance I get comboed to hell and its over. \n\nI'm reaching out here as I have no one else to ask feedback from and there seems to be a huge amount of knowledge here. I know the basic answer is \"You need to keep practicing\", my question though is am I putting my time into the right things. Should I continue to get worked over ranked until I don't or should I spend more time practicing in training mode first? Is just going through the list in Gief's gym the right approach or is there a hand full of concepts that I should first be concentrating on? I appreciate any advice you can give me. Overall I've been enjoying learning the game with the fight stick. I'm just coming from an afternoon with a particularly long streak of matches where it didn't even feel like I was playing the game and I want to make sure I'm not wasting my time with my approach.\n\nThanks in advance.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"StreetFighter","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnu5","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/StreetFighter","subreddit_subscribers":159828,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Looking For Feedback On My Progress","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.67,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StreetFighter\/comments\/wd3mu8\/looking_for_feedback_on_my_progress\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I grew up pretty sexually repressed, never even hearing my mom say the word sex in my entire life. On top of this she literally cannot handle any adult themes at all. Swearing makes her viscously angry, jokes that are actually funny or are even a tiny bit adult themed make her gag. She literally cannot handle any mention of sex and any time there is any mention she subtly wishes mildly violent things on the person discussing them. She hates ALL M rated video games and refuses to play any of them or even look at them if there's even mild animated violence. She thinks violent movies are terroristic and the creators should be punished. She thinks anyone who likes violence in media at all is a potential shooter. She thinks rap beats even are enough to make someone want to \"Join a gang\".\n\nShe can't stand any music that has adult themes or that has a hard hitting rhythm\/melody to it (Linkin Park makes her angry). She can't stand seeing any kind of minority who isn't extremely clean cut because she gets very scared. She can't handle shouting in anything, she refuses to read any books or graphic novels with any type of adult themes in it. Anything that actually looks badass or cool at all, she hates with a passion. Any time I have any \"\"\"swagger\"\"\" in my looks or walk or anything she calls it out instantly and hates it with a passion and just wants me to be as lame as possible. \n\nShe's 60 fyi.

Initially, I thought my blindness would be temporary, so I read all the handbooks and watched all the YouTube videos I could because I needed some form of motivation to keep on going.\n\nWhen my surgeon told me it would be permanent, I was crushed.

I am brand new to cosplay, so I have absolutely zero experience with picking up a needle and learning how to make clothes or any sort of apparel by hand. I don't plan on learning it anytime soon, because I have incredibly shaky hands that I cannot control. So I need a buyers guide for a very specific thing, as well as a few questions. Any and all answers or tips are highly appreciated!\n\n\nBasically, I am going to cosplay as RALSEI from DELTARUNE (The black version of him). I think I got the dress, hat, and scarf that I want ready to buy so no need to worry about that. What I need is a HEAD, HANDS, and LEGS\/FEET. Here is what I found:\n\n- I found some unrelated black paws I found online elsewhere. I am having trouble finding ones without paw pads though, which I prefer them not to be there in this instance. Not a dealbreaker if so. Doesn't need to be extreme fursuit quality, just cheap good enough ones.\n\n- The legs I figured would be mostly covered by the dress I am wearing, so it's mostly the ankles and feet which I think I can use black fur boots on. Specifically the kind you see on early 2000's scene outfits. (I hope that made sense lol). \"Toe beans\" are also preferred to not have, again not a deal breaker. Cheap good enough ones to pass as feet work well, again not looking for super high quality.\n\n- The head, from what I have researched needs to be commissioned. The options I found are SUPER EXPENSIVE (which totally makes sense). For someone looking for a black Ralsei head not needing to cover the neck, who would you consider commissioning? This part is not going to be cheap no matter where I look, but what is *generally* the most affordable for high quality? I can provide images of another ralsei cosplay head that I want replicated if needed just in case. \n\n-Since my dress is going to be on me as clothing and not on a body suit, will the head be awkwardly big in comparison? I know it's gonna be big either way which is what I am going for, just hopefully not BOBBLE HEAD uncanny big in comparison to my body, yknow? I am 6'1 if this helps.\n\n\nThis is the only \"fursuit\" I will ever get, so this is all really confusing and new to me. Any and all help or reccomendations I will be EXTREMELY thankful for!

I'm 29 now. This is so much to type out, let's see if I can provide enough info and NOT get so bored that I change my mind about posting all together. \n\nI'm not currently on any medication because I have absolutely no ability to get to the doctor anymore. (Lost my job, car broke down.) A few times in the past for somewhat short periods of time, I have been on stimulant medication and it worked well. Most recent time I was on medication was a few months ago before I lost my job. I stopped being able to make it to my appointments because of my work schedule. I got burnt out I guess. \n\nI don't know if there are any options for me to get my medication and my life just continues to deteriorate before my eyes while waiting for some kind of option to come along. As of that's actually going to happen. \n\nI live in the middle of nowhere. My car is broke down. I have no friends, and the little family I do have cannot be counted on to support me or help me in any way, with transportation or anything else. Public transportation is not a thing even close to where I live. I'm too far from anything to be able to walk or bicycle to a job. So I have no income.\n\nI have government healthcare (I'm in kentucky), and can't understand any of it. Can't focus long enough to be able to read on it to begin to understand it. Can barely keep my cellphone turned on to be able to use the internet to research anything anyway. I can't find a good source for making money on the internet. At least can't focus or stay motivated long enough to follow through with any of them. \n\nEverything is highly difficult - impossible for me right now and I need medication to be able to even begin to regain stability.\n\nThe laws here, according to what I \"know\" anyway, (it's possible my knowledge of them is outdated or that I just have a misunderstanding of them) are ridiculous, and seem to do nothing but inhibit people from getting the help they need.\n\nI also have depression and anxiety so, hell of a combo. I typically have to take some sort of benzodiazapine alongside my stimulant because of my anxiety. It's hard enough to find anyone to prescribe these medications to begin with, and then when they do they require you to come back every week for a while, then every 2 weeks, then 4, to be drug tested in order to keep receiving your prescriptions.\n\nMy government healthcare claims to provide transportation, but I have tried this, and they make it impossible to even do by requiring that you be referred, by another doctor, to any doctor that's more than a particular distance away.(everywhere is more than that distance away from me.) Along with other rules and stipulations that make it too much to even try to deal with. They do this intentionally I'm sure.\n\nMy life just feels so impossible when I'm not on my medication. Everything falls apart and I feel so overwhelmed and incapable. I've finally learned that I can't manage without.

That's all that really matters.\n\nI have played **Elder Scrolls Online, ArcheAge, Bless Unleashed, and New World** in the past. I wouldn't be opposed to playing one of those MMO's again, or perhaps other ones. I am NOT interested in FFXIV, WoW, GW2, Lost Ark, or BDO.\n\n**Hearthstone** is literally my favorite game of all time, but it's going down hill. Would love for you to suggest a game for me to replace it with, but there's probably not one on the market and anything you suggest is something I've already tried and don't like. That said, I'm always down to play HS with someone else. It's fun to watch each other play and give advice. Kinda like co-op! I play mostly **Standard** and **Arena**. Not into Wild, Battlegrounds, or Mercenaries at all, and not very much into Duels or Classic either.\n\nWould love to find someone to play **League of Legends** with, but... I suck (Iron elo) and would prefer to play with similar. Not looking for someone toxic.\n\nI also like obscure strategy games such as **Thea 2** or **Across the Obelisk**. It'd be super fun to find somebody to play those with.\n\nI play **Path of Exile,** **Diablo 3,** and **Last Epoch**. I mostly play PoE on standard, but could be convinced to make new characters together in a league. I haven't played PoE much since Elden Ring came out. So far I've mainly only played PoE on PC, but not opposed to playing on PS4 if I find someone to play with. (It just sucks all my stashes and everything else doesn't transfer over.)\n\nI'm mainly a PC gamer but I'm not opposed to playing **Bless Unleashed** on PS4 or **Path of Exile**. I've played Bless Unleashed on the PS4 and have downloaded it on the PC, but haven't started playing yet on PC. I'm down for PS4 suggestions for games too.\n\nI'm not interested in playing any FPS or Minecraft or RTS. The only RTS I've ever played and liked is They Are Billions. Definitely not interested in multiplayer RTS. Also not interested in sports games or racing games.\n\nI mainly like **MMORPG's, ARPG's, JRPG's, other RPG's, strategy games** (NOT puzzle)**, and card games**. But that's not all I like. I'm sure there are many other games I'd be into or have played before that aren't listed here. Just hit me up if you think I'd be interested!\n\nA little about me: I'm 33 years old, live in the US in central time zone, and live alone with my 2 cats. I'm looking for friends to game with because I don't really have many. I'm online every night and usually gaming! I'm super friendly and talkative and looking for the same, and someone who has time to talk and to play. I'm also LGBTQ+ friendly in case that needs to be said. Also looking for people who have a sense of humor. I don't care about your age as long as we get along.\n\nI'm usually on from around 5 to 7 PM until around 1 to 3 AM, Central time.\n\nI'm NOT looking to join a community of a bunch of people I don't know right away.\n\nVoice chat is mandatory; it's not any fun to play with someone who I can't talk to in real time. I love using discord both to voice chat in game, and to talk outside of game.

However the girth is a different story. When I was 30 years of age the girth was around 6\". Today it measure 7.25\" at the largest part!

But that change is nothing compared to what has happened more recently. \n\nThe shape has always been thickest just after the base then tapers in a bit. (Cone shape). Due to increase in girth during erections I have phimosis, something I've never had before. If I try to roll back the foreskin it will just unroll instantly. This is due to the shape and thickness. The skin feels on my shaft is completely stretched out. I think the limit of the skin might be the only thing stopping it getting even thicker. \n\nI have used a rubber cock ring for a bit few years ago. Before the growth.

I don't have gender preferences, and welcome all the peoples! \n\nWhat I'm looking for: \nHonestly I've been trying to make this post for a while, but I struggle to find the right words. I'm looking for a dominant who let's me get away with a bunch. Someone who will let me pick the songs the whole car ride. Or decide what movie we watch. Someone who will let me express my princessy behavior to its fullest extent. But on the other hand I still want discipline. I want to be reminded that the control could be taken out of my hands any second you decide. I want one look to remind me where I belong. Someone who exerts dominant energy without actively using it. \nYou're probably asking me, why do you think you're worthy of that treatment? Well..that's up to you to decide. I'm not looking for somebody to tolerate the dynamic. I'm looking for someone who enjoys it.\n\nWho I am:\nI'm M(name). I'm 18. I've got a cutesy face, with a chubby body attached. I'm 5'2, so if you've got a size kink then I'm probably right down your alley. I'm autistic so I show affection in different ways and sometimes jokes fly right over my head. It creates obstacles in my day to day life. It's important that I make that clear that sometimes I can be difficult or different from a lot of people. I play video games and can have a decent conversation about building a pc. I'm going to college and don't plan on dropping out. I'm monogamous. \n\nKinks: \n I'm experimental, but inexperienced. I like trying new things and exploring. I'm a masochist. Other things I like include: temperature play, sensory play, bondage, anal, orgasm control, deep throating, and etc. \n\nOverall I'm just looking for someone I really click with.

All I want is just a fucking break. I never seem to get one.\n\nMy earliest memories were always my parents fighting. I used to hide from them because I was so scared. Then they divorced and I had to deal with tactics of alienation, abuse directed at me and severe depression that followed. Plus, moving around as a kid was also stressful. I remember being 11 and just wanting to die due to all the shit I was dealing with. Things never got better.\n\nWhen I turned 14 is when my hallucinations and delusions started. I was skipping school all the time until I graduated due to extreme paranoia and the thought that my classmates\/teachers were out to get me. I couldn't sleep at night due to mania and sometimes the hallucination of the man at night that wanted me to die since he had been so miserable since he committed suicide. I had the delusion that God was also talking to me and was going to reveal the second coming to me. My parents never believed me on anything when I tried to talk about stuff.\n\nI then go to college and become an alcoholic at 18 because of my mental illness, ptsd from growing up and my inability to handle anything since I was never given those fucking tools. My alcoholism leads to me failing school, getting raped multiple times and constantly treated very poorly in relationships.\n\nI moved away with a guy when I was 21 who helped me get sober. Of course, that came at the cost of severe abuse. He would starve me, force me to weigh myself and I had to work out everyday typically for about 2 hours. I developed anorexia. He constantly cheated on me, forced me to \"prostitute\" myself.  I never had to sleep with anyone but had to make tons of videos and pictures for him. He lied all the time. He constantly coerced me into sex, I wasn't really allowed to say no. That was such a stressful time.\n\nThen I move back to get away from him. I get a job and apartment for myself. Things really seemed to be looking up. Then covid. Lost my job, found a temp one and then a full time one. The full time one was so stressful and so toxic it gave me a breakdown.\n\nIn the last year I have had to have two surgeries, one hospitalization, caught covid, my best friend committed and now I have a major housing issue going. My current apartment complex has illegally entered my apartment with no notice 4 times in this year alone. Destroyed some property of mine. Had my utilities and services taken out of my name in an attempt to close out services even though I still live here. \n\nI'm sick of all this shit. Life has never been good. I'm just constantly jumping from one fucking train wreck to the next.  I don't think I have had a period of just 6 fucking months without incident. Not once in my life. Even the shit I said on here is just scratching the surface of shit I have to deal with. I'm fucking tired of all of it. \n\nWhat's next you know? What will be my next major life event this year? Maybe I'll get paralyzed. Maybe someone will give me fucking HIV. Maybe another fucking person will die in my life. I've already been to over 15 funerals in fucking life and I'm 26. I'm so fucking sick of everything life throws at me. \n\nWHEN DO I GET A FUCKING BREAK!? 6 months is all I want. I just want to work and go home and that is it. That is all I want. I'm so tired of everything. I can never just relax. I'm always just waiting and preparing for some other major life event. \n\nI'm so tired of all of this. Life has never been good and it has never been easy. I can't even really look at a point in my life and say I was happy. I don't think I have ever really been happy. Just existing and finding ways to get through.\n\nPeople don't understand what I am talking about when I say I need a break. They don't understand why I am tired of living. They constantly tell me things get better but it hasn't really gotten better in my 26 years. Just different circumstances. I'm not gonna kill myself but fuck I'm tired. I really don't know how many more years I can keep living with such major stressful things always happening. \n\nI just want a fucking break. I just want to catch my breathe. I'm just so tired. So very very tired. \n\nThanx for coming to my TED talk.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"venting","subreddit_id":"t5_2sdi7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/venting","subreddit_subscribers":75986,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I'm done with life","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.81,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/venting\/comments\/wd43is\/im_done_with_life\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}

Where are my wounds ? Why is my skin soft ? Why is there no red line on my arm and legs ? My scars are so thin I should have cut deeper. I miss the sensation I want to do it again. I'm looking at old pictures of my bleeding skin. It was so beautiful when my entire arm was covered in lines. Just looking at my arm was comforting. I wasn't alone they were there with me. They shared my pain and helped me cope. They were my friends they were me. One year ago they were the only thing I had left. They were the only one who knew how hard it was. They were the proof that my suffering wasn't just in my head. I feel like these wounds are a part of me and stop doing it feels like cuting off with your only best friend. I have \"real\" friend that I love more than anything and who support me fully but my scars are on another level. I can't explain or understand why I feel so attached and obsessed with it but it's my deepest self. Sh was the only thing I had left to stop these voices in my head it stopped me from killing myself. My blades were always with me ready to help me when depression and anxiety were crushing me. They were my only shelter my only escape. They were my secret, the last thing I had control over. When I think about sh I clearly see a sort of grim reaper figure it seems scary but I feel so secured with it around. She's the only one who has shared my burden she's the only one who know how hard it was. She's the only one who really saw my pain she saw me crying and suffocating trying to survive. My friend know that I was really sick but they weren't there, they never saw they can't even imagine. When I have flashbacks of last year I clearly see her looking above my shoulder. I know it's just me making up things but I felt so alone I can't even express the despair I was in. My emotions were so strong I couldn't keep them inside they were so painful even one year after I still cry when I have flashbacks of these moments. It was so much pain I couldn't breathe. But then I took my blade and for one tiny half of a second everything stopped. No more voices, no more choking. Only silence and peace just for 0,5 seconds. But it came back so I did it again. \n\nShe was here looking at my wounds gently holding my arm, she wasn't scared she understood. It was her, she shared my burden I wasn't alone. She was always with me the thought of doing it stopped my death thoughts from spreading. She saved me, she became a part of me. We lived together for 7 months then I started to feel better. When school restarted and I felt again she came back helping me. She stopped my panic attack, she helped me cope with anxiety, helped me fall asleep, helped me concentrate she stayed here. I needed her and there she was. Looking with me at the symptoms of my disastrous gestion of emotions. But she was never judgemental she was just here. I wasn't alone I can't let her go. I'm disgusted to have left her behind just because I feel better. When I look at my healed arm and legs I feel like she's fading away and she's taking a part of me with her. I refuse to forget my depression I want to remember this pain all my life because no one was here for the past desperate me so I will remember her because she's so strong and she's begging for someone to take care of her. No one will ever come she will continue to destroy herself alone but she will never end it. She will stay even if it is only because she hop to feel joy again she will do it. She is strong she must be remembered. And she's a part of me her existence will impact me all my life.\nI know my little grimy will be back I hope so. I really feel like she's a part of me.

Fair warning that this is gonna be a long personal, but you're worth it.\r  \n\r  \nTL;DR: I'm an experienced, creative, Dom looking for a sub who is equally driven in life, and yearns to give into\/be challenged by her trusted partner for a rewarding kinky relationship. Let's +1 each other! 🌟\r  \n\r  \nAbout me AKA \"Who is this man?\"\r  \nPhysically - I'm 34, single, white, active\/athletic (6'\/\\~180 lbs), brown hair\/blue eyes, booster vaccinated, non-smoker, clean\/DDF. Happy to verify each other with photos early on. \n\n\r  \nDaily life - I have a career that I'm passionate about, and love to juggle multiple projects (both professionally and hobbies) - I'm goal-oriented. I also live in my own place (no roommates). I consider D\/s to be an essential part of my romantic relationship, not just something for the bedroom (more on that below). I always make time for my partner and expect the same in return.\r  \n\r  \nWho and what I'm looking for\r  \nLet's be a kinky power couple together! Submission and D\/s are not mutually exclusive from having agency in life. In fact, they're complimentary. I'm looking for someone who considers herself driven\/ambitious\/passionate (whatever that means to you) - but also dreams of relinquishing control in the right hands. Someone craving to be with a trusted partner who will challenge her and help her succeed in everything she desires through structure, pleasure, discipline... This lifestyle is meant to make us be the best version of ourselves for each other, so shall we?\r  \n\r  \nMy ideal partner has the same traits that I bring: she loves to explore\/learn new things, she's active\/takes care of her physical + mental health, she has goals, she is communicative, empathetic, giving, loyal, honest, kinky, emotionally available, not looking for a \"sugar daddy\", and serious about finding a Dom partner.\r  \n\r  \nDo you already recognize yourself and think we could be compatible? Don't hesitate to PM me!\r  \n\r  \nI understand it can be intimidating, so know you are appreciated. (:\r  \n\r  \nThe kinky stuff\r  \nExperience - Whether this is your first or fiftieth rodeo, I'm welcoming of all as I've been in the lifestyle for the past 10+ years. In that time, I've had a few D\/s relationships to different degrees (including DDlg, TPE, M\/s) which have led me to narrow down what I need and look for, hence this post. I'm an open book and always happy to answer your questions.\r  \n\r  \nD\/s dynamic - I consider myself your catharsis, comfort, and accountability rolled into one. Nurturing but exhilarating, sweet yet firm, dominant but respectful. The one constant is that I'm big on communication, making our relationship not just a safe-space but something unique to us. That means I would like to spend time together or chat regularly (outside work) since this is a relationship. My partner is a priority for me, just as I want to be for her. I'm also a believer in (negotiated) structure and rules. Obviously nothing happens until we've established clear connection, consent, and mutual respect. Much more to discuss there.\r  \n\r\r  \nMy kinks - Include impact play, hypnosis, sensation play, humiliation\/degradation, training\/tasks\/protocols.\r  \n\r  \n\n\nI am an experienced Dominant seeking my servant.\r  \n\r  \nI strongly believe that the highest function of D\/s is as a tool to build someone up. To give them the support, companionship, motivation, structure and accountability necessary to manifest positive change in their life. So, we're going to work together toward accomplishing your goals and I am going to give you accountability and support in your pursuit of the person you desire to be. I'm going to create routine and structure for you, create a regimented and disciplined environment for you to thrive in. We're going to make sure you eat healthy, that you exercise regularly, that you meditate daily. We're going to work through the narratives that define and limit you, and help you build a healthier relationship with yourself, one that allows you to thrive. I am looking for someone who can fully dedicate themselves to a life of service with me. A lifestyle of service to each other.\r  \n\r  \nI want to make an equal exchange.\r  \n\r  \nI'll have your complete subservience and respect. You will always address me as \"Sir\", you will never talk back, you will serve my pleasure. In return, you will be my adored pet, I will talk you to sleep every night, and greet you with brightness and love every morning.\r  \n\r  \nYour body will be mine to see and use and enjoy always. I will see every part of you daily. You will be allowed no modesty and no shame. In return, you will have a friend and companion, who is always there, who cares and wants to get close to you. To know you and to hold you.\r  \n\r  \nYour mind will be for my pleasure and use. You will be not be allowed to keep any secrets from me. Even what you're ashamed of, even what you can't tell others, you will tell me when I demand it. You will be trained and conditioned to give me all of yourself, to always serve me with more. And you know that friend and companion part up there? I really really mean it. If you need to wake me up in the middle of the night, if you need me to pull over on the side of the road, I will, you will be my special one, I will find a way to be there, 24\/7, always.\r  \n\r\r  \nI will control what parts of your life I wish to control. I will control what you wear everyday, how you groom yourself, how you wear your hair, your workout routine, what you eat. But, while it will be for my pleasure, it will be for your benefit. I will be a mentor, guide and disciplinarian. We are going to always work towards you being the best human being you can be. We will always work towards accomplishing your goal, and creating a life where you can be happier and happier and always have a high self-esteem.\r  \n\r  \nYou will suffer for me. You will always carry bruises for me. You will cry for my pleasure. And, do you need a hand filing your taxes? I really do want your life to be a part of mine. I want video messages about random things. I want food porn. Shower thoughts. Deep musings. Every day mundane pictures that you took just because. That painting you just drew. That story you just wrote. And I will...well, I'm not the best at that social media thing, but I will return the favor when I can. And, I will be a true partner, I will talk to you about my dreams, my struggles, my successes, my failures. You will help keep me accountable for my goals. And definitely, food photos. Photos of food are important.\r  \n\r  \nYou will be my slave, friend, slut, companion, whore, lover, pet and most importantly very best friend.\n\nIf the fact that I've written these words to find you gets you excited, then the only thing left is to message me. ✨","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BDSMpersonals","subreddit_id":"t5_2smyd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BDSMpersonals","subreddit_subscribers":246119,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"34 [M4F] Experienced Dom looking for driven sub to formpower couple! ✨💪 #Florida","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BDSMpersonals\/comments\/wd43ru\/34_m4f_experienced_dom_looking_for_driven_sub_to\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Knowing you aren't alone does help a bit! So I haven't been officially diagnosed with PMDD, but more self-diagnosed. I am 35 and only started experiencing this 2 cycles ago at the end of April. For a few years, my period has been irregular (I went from like clockwork 30-32 days cycles to stretching from anywhere from 55-65 days). Then in April, I suddenly got crazy anxiety, couldn't fall asleep because of adrenaline surges due to the anxiety (I was so tired and so anxious that I wouldn't get a good night of sleep, which of course causes me NOT to sleep), couldn't keep food or water down. I cried and cried and felt like I was going to die (NOT me normally). It lasted about 3 weeks. I've been feeling really good the last 2 months, June's cycle was fine. Then BAM, this one started with slight anxiety about 2 days before and then the sleep issues started the night my period did. A lot of research I've read states that the symptoms should start going away when your period starts, but here we are on day 5 and I'm still not feeling better. Does this happen to anyone else?? The only reason I sleep is because I end up taking a Xanax that the ER doctor prescribed when I went in during my first episode in April. This makes the adrenaline anxiety go away, and then I can sleep. \nI'm just scared. This is all new to me and I hate that I felt so good for 2 months only to be right back here. Telling myself that it is temporary only helps sometimes. When I'm in the throes of it, I just want to cry and feel like myself again.
