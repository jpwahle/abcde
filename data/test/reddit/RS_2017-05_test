She followed me and continued arguing then tried to throw something at me and i tried to block it (i didn't hit me because i moved) and she just started hitting me and so i was hitting her too trying to get her off of me. She wouldn't let me go and was pushing me on the ground and the floor and i just kept telling her to let go and and get out. She let go and i was screaming saying i was calling the police and she took my phone out of my hand so i was just like okay whatever, when i tried to walk out my room, she wouldn't let me. So i really got mad and grabbed one of my old phones and called the police while she just kept trying to take the phone from me. (She was making up excuses like \"mom's gonna be mad stop you're gonna get her in trouble\" but really she's been in trouble with the law sooo many times, she just didn't want to be in trouble.) I was on the phone getting help so she was just calling everyone trying to make it seem like i attacked her first or i deserved it. (she changed the story so many times) She had got ahold of my mom and had told me my mom a bunch of lies and my mom believed everything (knowing she lies) and my mom just took her side. (like always) The lady on the phone was asking what happened and i remember just crying (i wasn't injured really but i just violated like if you've ever been hit by a \"family member\" you'd understand) and she had asked who else was there and i said my nephew was there crying and my sister was just yelling at me and we just kept arguing because she was just trying to blame me for everything. I'm 16 and she's almost 20, i don't think she had a reason to put her hands on me. She's a lot bigger than me and has always tried to overpower people to get what she wants by force, she's a bully. I understand i said things, but she said things too, along the lines of me dying and killing myself and saying i was depressed. (which i'm not, i just used to be and she uses that against me even though she's had her depression since like middle school) My sister took the initiative to call basically her whole contact list and lie and change her story about what happened. My mom and the police arrived and my mom talked them basically saying \"they're sisters, it's no big deal\" and they left. I was more in trouble and of course like always, my mom didn't help solve the situation at all, she ignored it which she's been doing since i was little because my sisters have ALWAYS used me as there way of getting their anger and insecurities out (usually just verbally but sometimes it's gotten physical and it's gotten worse since i've started sticking up for myself) I was the only one in trouble, yea my sister got the \"she's younger don't hit her\" talk but she's gotten that talk so many times and nothing's changed. I was the one she yelled at the most, i was the one she had an attitude with for days and i was the only one grounded. I called for help to show how serious it was, i've lived with my sisters bullying me for years and it's getting worse and just because i wasn't seriously hurt this time, doesn't mean there won't be a time where i really do get hurt. Can i please get opinions and advice?

A few years ago, my parents \u201cgave\u201d me a Springfield 597 .22lr long gun for Christmas. Im almost one hundred percent positive that the gun is registered under my mother or father (I don\u2019t think it matters in this case) because I think I was about 15 at the time but not sure. This occurred in the state of New York, where I lived my whole childhood. I think both my parents have a CCP in the state of New York and they own a couple other firearms. \nNow I am 20 years old, soon to be 21 in October, in college at NC State University. So obviously I am attending school in North Carolina and stay here over the summers, so I don\u2019t go home to New York. I am looking to buy another firearm for myself here soon as I consider myself a resident but, I must get my driver\u2019s license transferred to this state in order to do that. \nMy question is, how would my father go about actually giving me that firearm as a gift now that he trusts that I am old enough to solely possess the gun? I figured that if we \u201clived\u201d in the same state it would be as simple as walking into a gun store with the firearm and signing some paperwork and going back home. But the fact that he currently possesses it in NY and I want to own it in NC causes one difficulty and also the strictness of NY gun laws seems like another barrier. If anyone could give me some guidance as to how I can get this firearm in my possession without committing a felony that would be great.\nMy gut instinct is that he would take it to an FFL in NY and they would ship it to an FFL in NC of which I would go to and sign paperwork to receive the firearm. Or would he be able to just ship the firearm himself to an FFL in my area?

I confronted her and her eyes could not focus on me. Nothing she was saying made any sense. Then after me telling her we were not going anywhere she was clearly high mentally or some other way. She admitted to drinking vodka and taking 15 fioricet pills and said she had been abusing prescription opioids for a long time and was suicidal.

I am familiar with the process of addiction recovery and have never had a problem, after a couple of attempts, either cutting these habits completely out of my lifestyle or going cold turkey for a set period of time and then reintroducing them at a healthy/acceptable level.\n\nPMO however is different, I have tried many times and so far not broken 23 days. This is without a doubt the most difficult addiction I've ever dealt with (may just be me personally), perhaps due to the accessibility of PMO; it's constantly only two clicks away on my smartphone (whereas say I'd have to walk to the shop to buy a bottle of spirits) and it is free (if you don't include mental health, time and energy as costs), or perhaps due to how long I've ignored it as a problem I need to solve. \n\nEither way, I am currently on a 15 or so day streak and I am confident this streak is to be my final streak (confidence is key), but I think what I have learnt is that due to the high accessibility of PMO you have to be constantly wary of relapse, no matter how confident you are, you are only a few minutes away from a potential relapse. Have a routine planned out as emergency. Also most importantly, never binge, each time it depletes your progress exponentially more than the last.\n\nThe only good thing I can take from this being so difficult is that the benefits are mentally unlike anything I've experienced before while fighting addictions.

I'm also crying. There may be typos, or I may phrase something wrong. I'm doing my best to follow all the rules here.\n\nSo I'm 19, and I recently discovered this sub is a thing. My friend uses reddit quite frequently, and pointed me here, and it's been eye opening. I always suspected my parents were abusive and knew they were neglectful, but no authority has ever agreed with me so I've been quite confused.\n\nFor context: my parents have interesting habits. I might be described as a picky eater, but I eat a ton of normal foods. When I was a kid I heard stories and watched shows on TV where people ate things like eggs, bacon, waffles, cereal, etc for breakfast. I asked my mom for any of the above to try and she would only serve me straight egg whites. It wasn't very appealing or flavorful to me as a four year old so I refused to eat it. My mom's solution for that was for me to skip breakfast until my teachers complained that I asked for extra snacks in school.\n\nOn multiple occasions, I've had fainting spells. They have always occurred while I am in a doctors office and also starving. I never really figured if it was just that doctors make me uncomfortable (they do), or if I was fainting from starvation (I wasn't really feeling that hungry, but I tend to not get hungry unless I go 36 hours without eating). I also knew my dad has always suffered from low blood pressure, and we suspect that's how my grandmother died. Last December, my dad told me the easy cure for low blood pressure is consuming more salt. My mom hates salt with a passion; she always told me \"Salt is not needed. You are better off not consuming it at all.\" Combined with a below average blood pressure + not eating enough + not consuming enough salt + being stressed by doctors, I can see how I'd have fainting spells. The punchline: I asked my mom for food during those occasions and she refused me because \"The food available is expensive and unhealthy.\"\n\nSo anyway, I've tried talking to Child Protective Services. I showed them bruises where my dad hit me. I told them that my dad explicitly said children don't have rights and that my parents can do whatever they want to me. They did their investigation and told me two things: first, my parents have \"good intentions,\" and were instructed not to physically harm me, so they're fine, and second, you need at least three months of therapy before you know if a therapist is a good match for you or not and since I had only been in for six weeks I can't possibly know if I like my therapist or feel comfortable opening up to them.\n\nMy therapists (I tried two; we stopped seeing the first after she strongly recommended I take a dietary supplement to make me more obedient and it gave me hallucinations.) weren't helpful. The first flat out told me my parents were abusive but that there was nothing I could do (I was 13 at the time), and my best bet was to wait it out until I was 18. The second told me my parents were great people with good intentions and I was the problem. She claimed I was nearly autistic and had oppositional defiant disorder. \n\nMy teachers told me that children don't experience hardships in America. I can't have a life that's that bad because I had near perfect grades (straight 100's with like one 99) and friends and rich parents. My classmates told me I was lucky because I was so much smarter than them and had the money to get things like a new phone.\n\nSo I've always had a tendency to obey my superiors. If my parents want something done a specific way, I'll do it. This has given me odd habits done to please my parents and reduce the number of screaming fights we have. This is why I believed my parents, CPS, my therapists, and my teachers, and even my older classmates. They even all agreed with each other for the most part. Until I met my current boyfriend and told him some stories about my past, I just thought I was a spoiled greedy child. I have trouble differentiating between \"I asked for a new computer and my parents said no,\" and \"I asked for dinner and my parents said too bad and now I passed out in school.\" He's working on teaching me that some stories are just me being greedy/addicted to coping mechanisms while some are my parents being bad people.\n\nIn addition to my NParents being sort of bad at parenting (perhaps an understatement), I had some abusive relationships (I was raped like 30 times by my boyfriend but due to the whole hyper-obedience thing I didn't want to say no or leave). Both my grandmothers died in the last 3 years and my parents got mad at me for missing school because of it. These were the first two people who I've known who've died, and I wasn't even really properly allowed to grieve.\n\nI sort of realized my parents didn't love me like normal parents when I was 13, and that caused me to become suicidal and depressed. My parents ended up finding out, and got really mad at me and forbid all communication with my friends, because my mom read on the internet that the internet causes teens to become suicidal, so teens should only communicate to others via voice, and she took my phone so I couldn't send secret messages. This of course made me more depressed, but I learned how to hide my emotions and continued cutting myself after my parents stopped watching me. Most of this stopped once I moved out, but I don't want to expose myself to them more than necessary.\n\nSo in the present, I've moved away from my parents (to Canada, I'm a dual citizen). I'm still financially dependent on them for school, but I limit my interactions with them as much as possible. They complain that I only call them once every three months or so, and I explain that it's because I'm busy with school (not really a lie). I've also had a bit of an interesting year away from home because while I left knowing my parents were mean and I wanted to be away from them, I had no idea just how bad. I didn't even realize my abusive relationships were abusive until after they were over. I was always pushing myself to get perfect grades up through high school, so I never had a chance to really analyze my emotions and figure out what was going on and sort through the trauma myself. Now it's all coming out because my boyfriend opened the floodgates, and every day I come to new realizations (yesterday's was that children do in fact have rights and parents can't just do what they want with their kids).\n\nI can't really stand my parents anymore. I got into arguments frequently with them when I lived with them, but now it feels like I have to use doublethink to even have a conversation with them. Yesterday I spoke with my mom on the phone about taking summer classes (because I'm supposed to have a summer semester), and she said \"oh no I'm sorry to hear that [two students have committed suicide at my school in the past two years]. It's terrible that parents would put so much pressure on their kids to do so well in school that they'd feel they have no other option. ... why not just take 3 easy classes and one really hard class? Then you aren't taking five. If you just ask around to see who the best profs are, you'll be fine.\" I flat out told her I wanted to take a semester off because my parents have shipped me across the globe during each of my previous breaks and I've had 5 semesters in a row now with no proper break time to myself. It's like she can't hear me. Then she went on a rant about how my dad is upset I want to take a break and it's the end of the world if I graduate late, and this is why they haven't sent me money yet and my rent is due tomorrow. I haven't spoken to my parents since February and this conversation just destroyed me. I spent two weeks prepping what I was going to say, so I could manipulate her into believing I needed a break. Today she sent me an email saying she's coming to visit on Tuesday. I'm not ready for this.\n\n**TLDR** The above paragraph. I don't really want advice on what to do because I've mostly got that down (haven't totally figured out what to do about her visiting, but at least she has no legal right to enter my house since it's in my name). I really just needed to get my thoughts down, so I could convince myself I'm making sense and using logic.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[Support] [TW: All of the Above] My NParents are at it again","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/68iza1/support_tw_all_of_the_above_my_nparents_are_at_it/","view_count":null}

I play some PC games so if you do too then that's a huge plus! (Admittedly I'm not very good but I still like to talk about them :3)\n\n* Politeness. Trust me, I love absolutely degrading myself and a lot of rough ideas but if you can't be friendly or respectful outside of those moments then I'm not interested.\n\n**Kinks**\n\n* I'm very submissive and enjoy pet-play, collars and serving. If we write a story... part of the story will involve you giving me a nose ring and maybe a butt plug.\n\n* I have a very strong oral fetish, swallowing is great! Spit and watersports are extra great!

I'm Emma, I'm 18 years old and I'm still in high school, although mercifully not for long. I love movies, music and sex. Sex the most. Lots of girls in school either don't like it or act like they don't, which makes no sense to me. It feels amazing!! Do these bitches cum differently than I do? Speaking of cum, I have the great gift of being brought to orgasm much easier than most girls. It takes maybe 2-3 minutes for me to have an orgasm.\n\nI have a lot of friends, but my idea of friendship is a little different than most people's. I like to have sex with my friends. As opposed to this dumb monogamy idea, I want to have sex with multiple partners, and they're all guys who I really like as people. Why doesn't everybody do it this way?\n\nWhen I'm not having sex with my friends, I'm doing fun friend stuff like talking, watching Netflix together, eating, maybe smoking depending on what you're into. I can talk about almost anything, not because I'm smart, but because I'm interested in the things I don't know about.\n\nThe role-play will just be me and a friend (you) hanging out like we always do. Sex, affection and just enjoying one another's company.\n\nOur hanging out is gonna be just like any other time. I text you while I'm still at school and tell you I wanna spend the night at your place, you say that's cool but I'll have to wait till you're back from work. I go home and I have time to change. I think about wearing something sexy but then think again, I'm gonna tease him a little. I hate women who tease, I find it cruel but only if they don't end up giving up the pussy, and sure intend to give it up. I arrive at your home wearing a pony tail, a hoodie and jeans. I look pretty but very little of my body is showing. I knock on your door.\n\nSo which one of my friends are you? You can be anyone you want to be, any age (over 18, obviously), any personality, I could get along with anyone, but in your first message tell me who you are. It has to be detailed because remember, we've known each other very well before the role-play.\n\nJump straight in from where I left off. Introduce yourself, like I described in the first paragraph.

I have Asperger's and whenever I talk to people I get the feeling that I'm making them uncomfortable with my nasally voice and weird, creepy mannerisms.  I'm also really funny-looking, I'm pretty sure people can tell I'm a total loser just by looking at me.  There's no easier place for a man to meet girls than in college and since I've never met a girl who's interested or attracted to me I guess that means I'm kind of pathetic.\n\nWhen I was in college my first year I decided I wanted to be more social then I was in high school and I'd also like to have a relationship.  I met girls through friends, at parties, student groups, etc. but they'd always ignore me and talk to the better-looking, more outgoing guys. (not that I blame them for that)  It made me feel awful and eventually I felt gross just thinking about being with a girl, like anyone who I'd actually be attracted to is out of my league and they'd laugh at me if they knew how I felt.  I'd always develop these stupid crushes on girls and it would make me feel horrible since there's nothing I can do about it that's healthy or productive.  \n\nSorry if that sounds weird but an example of this is I knew a girl through a student organization who I thought was really cool and pretty and unique but all I could think of is how creepy she'd think I am if she knew how I feel about her and how much I think about her.  If I asked her out or whatever (a dumb idea since I had no reason to believe she was interested) she'd probably just laugh about it and think it's funny that the weird guy has the hots for her. When I'd sit down and really think about it I'd realize how absurd the idea of any of these girls being attracted to or interested in a guy like me really is.  I went on two dates ever in college and both of the girls basically ignored me afterwards, I took it as a lesson that it's not worth getting my hopes up.  \n\nRight now I'm still looking for a good job and trying to get into a different field (IT) so dating isn't a priority but I'm worried that once I get the rest of my life together, which in all honestly I probably won't, I'll be too old and inexperienced to be attractive to anyone, as if I had a chance in the first place.  I've been thinking all weekend about how sad it is that I've spent my whole life being unable to connect with a woman and share a mutual attraction.  I'll never get to have that first kiss or a fun high school/college relationship.  I'm worried I'll be one of those guys who goes insane with loneliness and becomes completely bitter and hateful towards women.  How do I deal with this?  Is there still hope for me?

I've experienced this before as it has been randomly occurring every 2 or 3 weeks with no correlation to what I'm doing. What I know now to be a pulled/strained muscle, I thought at the time was a heart condition / problem.\n\nThe night this happened last I made the worst decision to start googling my symptoms and begin reading the menagerie of health problems I could have. The worst part of all of this is that, the symptoms of a heart condition / heart attack mirror those of severe anxiety / panic attack which I believe I was happening. It was a vicious cycle of reading the symptoms of a heart problem, which caused my anxiety to raise which in turn made my physical symptoms worse.\n\nFinally managing to pry myself from the computer, my mind is racing with every possible ailment I may have. For the next two and a half days I was having sever anxiety / panic that I just could not shake. Any of the ideas that had worked their way into my mind, I couldn't get them out until I had closure. on the third morning this was bothering me I went to an Urgent Care facility while the doctor was confident nothing was wrong with me (I'm 26, don't smoke / drink/ exercise regularly, at a healthy weight etc..), he thought it would prove useful to have an ECG and chest X-ray performed. All of which showed up negative for anything being wrong with me.\n\nI feel a bit ridiculous for letting something so minor completely consume me and racking me with this fear and anxiety, and while I know now that I'm fine, I still have a lasting anxiety. For the past five or six days I'm relatively OK during the day until later in the afternoon, and I start to feel anxious and my heart pounds harder than usual. Not faster, just harder. Can the effects of prolonged, sever anxiety last this long? If so, how long on average do these sort of, heightened levels of anxiety last for? It's making me feel like a useless mess sometimes. I was prescribed Lorazepram which I have been taking in the afternoons when I start to feel this way, but I don't want to become dependent on it. Sorry for the long post, I suppose I ran on for much longer than I intended. Any input / advice is welcome.

Our youngest daughter L was born in July of 2014. A month later, we finally went out to celebrate and my wife started drinking more than and had ever drank. Next day, she sleeps all day long. She was pretty drunk that night, so I just let her sleep. She finally gets up and she's stumbling like she's still drunk. I had been with L and her sister J all day and needed to do some stuff in the kitchen, so I left the wife holding L. A few minutes later, I hear a thump and screaming from L. She's only a month old at this point. I run in to find the wife fell asleep and dropped the baby. Wasn't very far to the floor and L was fine, but I was pissed. Little did I know that this was the beginning of my life in Hell.\n\nOver the next few days, the wife is really acting funny. Almost a completely different person. She's drinking constantly, started smoking (she hadn't smoked in 10 years) angry all the time, and taking off in the car randomly. One night, I thought she had been drinking way too much, so I hid the alcohol. BIG MISTAKE. She's pissed, starts screaming at me and tearing up the house. I had to work the next morning so I'm trying to sleep. The wife comes in, starts yelling, flipping the light on and off, and doing everything she can to wake the baby. L slept in a bassinet next to us, so I grabbed her and held her in bed with me while the wife was on her warpath. I collect Transformers and had begun putting up shelves for my collection recently. She trashed all that.\n\nNext night, she takes off with her friend. I'm beyond exhausted by that point. 4am, she comes back, told me that she lost my debit card and had to go back out to find it, but she needed my car. Next afternoon, I go out to cut grass after she woke up. I got in her car to move it and found a shitload of mail. Whole car was filled. I go in, ask her about it and she laughed and shrugged. I really didn't know what to think, so I go to move my car. It's filled with mail also. I start cutting grass and about an hour later, she flags me down, says she has to go pick up her medicine, so I had to stop to watch the girls.\n\nHours go by, she doesn't come home. I discover a message on our voicemail from a police officer for her. Apparently, she tried to forge a script for vicodin, and the pharmacy reported her and they wanted to speak to her. She was arrested about an hour later at another pharmacy, where they also discovered the mail in my car. State police called me, told me what happened and I was to go pick her up. I'm questioned and I tell them everything that had been happening. I turn in the other mail and pick her up. I get punched in the face while I'm driving her home. Oh, and my car was impounded.\n\nNext day, she asks me to go pick up medicine for her. I'm leary of doing so but she tells me that her doctor called medicine in for her. Reluctantly, I go to Wal-Mart to pick it up and I'm escorted out by two police officers. Apparently she called it in herself and almost got me arrested. Luckily, I'm able to talk myself out of it.\n\nThe terror continues as she calls 911 on the neighbors in the middle of the night, several times. Her psychologist tells us that the alcohol caused a reaction with the klonopin that she was prescribed.\n\nShe had issues off and on over the next year or so. She totaled her car a year later in 2015. It's sitting in my yard still because I was still paying on it. It was in my name and since she had fucked up our finances, the insurance lapsed. I can't get the title for it until it's paid off, so I can't have it hauled away to a junk yard.\n\nShe ended up going to jail because she got a DUI when she wrecked. I actually bought myself an Xbox One while she was in because she wasn't spending all of the money. It was an early  Black Friday deal and I was drunk. Shortly before going in, she switched psychologists, and is finally diagnosed with bipolar.\n\nShe goes to rehab for her addictions to pain medication and comes back home around Christmas. She had another manic episode. Trashed the house again.\n\nThis keeps happening over and over. Manic cycle after manic cycle. She lost her license and has to depend on everybody to take her places. She's stolen and wrecked her parents' car. Stolen her grandmother's car to buy alcohol.\n\nHere's where it gets even worse:\n\nL was diagnosed with Leukemia in July of 2016. The wife drugged herself and was out of it after it happened. The manic episodes got bad again. I started a new job, where I work 50 hours a week, while trying to finish my Bachelor's in Network Administration. I clean the house constantly because she's a slob and can't seem to focus enough to clean anything. I love her still, but I'm so scared that someone will come to the house, see the mess because I can't keep up with her, and take my girls away. I just want our normal life with our girls.\n\nShe's currently in a manic episode right now. Everybody's against her, she says she has no support. We were going to go to dinner this evening but I turned around after going about a mile down the road. Got tired of her telling me about how everything is my fault because I don't talk to her enough. I got back in the car and drove off as she was walking into the house. Came back to her passed out and her mom brought the girls home 5 minutes later.\n\nI made them dinner, her too because I'm used to doing it. Hers is still sitting on the stove and I didn't even make myself anything. She tried crushing the end of my laptop charger while I was gone, so that I can't do my school work. I was able to fix it. I'm 2 classes from graduation and should have graduated last year. \n\nSorry it's so long, I just found this sub and I needed to vent and tell my story.

The internet is full of people thousands of miles away from you, what are they going to do to save your ass from a serial killer? After the events I will do my best to explain, I realize that posting is not a cry for help, yet a coping mechanism. In other words, to take in the reality of the situation, or take advice possibly. \n\nFirst, let me start off with that I am not sure if this will turn into a series. You are reading a series of messages I have sent to my friend, who is hopefully sharing my story with you.\n\nLet us start out with a hypothetical situation. Take the safest place you can think of, for me, it is a hotel room. I don't know why, maybe all the people around, or the only entrance is monitored by staff...\n\nAnyway, I want you to picture being with your friends and family, in your safe zone, safe as can be. Now, take away your peers, and add 50 demons or some scary ass shit. Now this did not happen to me exactly, yet you will understand what I am talking about.\n\nFor now, my name is Donald. I am 17, with a mother, father, and younger sister. My birthday was yesterday. Not necessarily for my birthday, but my family and I went to The Big Apple! My mother and father shared a hotel room, and my sister and I were in a connecting room. After celebrating my birthday with a nice dinner, we retired to hotel room particularly early, upon my request, to finish 13 Reasons Why.\n\nAfter wrapping up the show, I shut off my computer, and quickly ~~went to sleep~~. I **attempted** to go to sleep, only to be greeted with the scariest noise I have ever heard in my whole life. No it was not the slaughtering of a puppy, no it was not the sound of a bomb, but a single tap, on the window adjacent to me, on the 54th floor, outside of a hotel, in the heart of New York City. Not wanting to die, I woke up my 9 year old sister, for moral support, and to save my ass from a flying monkey demon. However, when I pulled those blinds up, I metaphorically and literally shit my pants. \n\nIt was a well groomed man, suit, tie, the whole spiel. Anything else? Oh wait, I forgot to mention, he had no eyes, and was FUCKING GRIPPING ONTO MY HOTEL WINDOW! For those who are blind, a window is a flat surface, and you can't grip onto a flat surface. Oh shit, I just realized, if you are blind you cannot read this.\n\nAnyway, my first instinct, thank god for evolution, was to close the blinds. That is what shall save me from spider~~man~~ demon. I went to grab my sister, but she was gone. I called for my parents, but you'll never guess, they were probably abducted by Evil Bill Gates 2.0 also!\n\nSo far I have bunkered myself into the bathroom. Fit with a coffee table barricade, and a warmed up clothing iron, to burn the fucker back to hell. I brought my phone, computer, chargers, and the whole minibar. Assuming i'm overreacting and/or tripping, I took so much minibar shit, I could spend a summer in Honolulu for the same price.\n\nThis may seem like a crumby story, however, I have not much more to say. I am a pussy and I locked myself in a bathroom. I will hopefully update you all more. Advice would be appreciated.\n\nFriend --- Thank you for posting this.

I used to drink casually with friends before this program, but after moving out and living alone, I steadily started drinking more and more towards the end of my first year, a habit which continued into my second year. I usually tried to keep some levels of control, such as skipping drinking every few days etc. This past month my stress and anxiety have been through the roof (I should add, I have General Anxiety Disorder, and I'm prescribed prozac as a result), and without really noticing it I realized im' drinking daily and not really taking any days off (6-10 drinks a day on average, but almost always only later on in the day). Anyways, this past week I've realized I'm not being as productive as I wanna be while studying, without much energy to get out of bed and to concentrate. This, combined with completely being completely out of it 2 days ago during the day, followed by drinking 11 beers and a couple more whiskey drinks, made me realize that I really need to slow it down. My problem right now is that I have I have 2 huge papers, 2 major projects, and 2 finals examples within the next two weeks, and a considerable amount of work left, in my last semester, with my gpa being borderline for graduation, meaning I can't really afford to mess up right now.\n\nI was very anxious yesterday, with my hands shaking and inability to focus. I forced myself to get the minimum amount of work I need to finish done, took an OTC sleep aid, and finally got some sleep. Today I was feeling more of the same, and had to meet with my project group, and took a xanax (which I only have 4 left) and managed to get through the meeting. \n\nMy concern is that I've heard withdrawals are at their worst within 3-5 days, which coincides with me having one paper due on tuesday and a huge presentation on thursday. Am I better off dealing with this after I graduate and am back home for a week or two without much responsiblities, or should i continue to not drink. \n\nI'm not sure if my anxiety is just that, anxiety due to a stressful tiime in life, or if its alcohol withdrawals. I tend to be always anxious.....but I have a bit of a \"panic\" feeling right now, combined with somewhat shaky hands (not shaking after I took the xanax). I haven't had nausea or anything else.\n\n\nAlso, I should add a month ago I had a weekend of very heavy drinking (all day drinking, lost count of how much i drank), and the following morning I very disoriented, had severe nausea, and was shaking uncontrollably and I went to urgent care. Of course at that point I didn't even think this could be cause of the drinking, and just figured I have food poisening or something. After getting Nausea meds via IV, I was able to go back home and rest for a couple of days without drinking, until i felt better and drank again, not thinking maybe the drinking was the problem in the first place.\n\nAnyways my point is that I can't afford to take a couple days of rest.....the main reason I'm stopping drinking is to be productive these next two weeks in the first place, so withdrawals would really be counterproductive. Also, don't get me wrong, I don't think that drinking this much is ok.... and I know I have to severely cut down or stop all together, but it's never been a problem in any part of my life until now. (No getting black out drunk episodes, no changes in personality to the point that I ruin relationships, no negative results in going to class/work, No cravings to the point that I can't control myself, etc, no drinking and driving, etc). But I'm not just looking for a short term fix, I do want to address this problem in the long run as well. but most importantly, I'm just needing some advice regarding if I'm actually experiencing withdrawals or not, how to mange it better, etc. ","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"alcoholism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rgl1","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Concerns for Withdrawals","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/68jg13/concerns_for_withdrawals/","view_count":null}
