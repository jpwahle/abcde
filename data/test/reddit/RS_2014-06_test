He had been dating this girl who is my age, and her and I became very close friends. The longer they were together, the closer her and I became. She was a beautiful and petite girl with the perkiest, and pierced, D-cup breasts and a plump little bum. I am also short and small-framed, but with a bigger ass and and smaller but still a nice pair of tits. I had always been jealous of my brother for grabbing such a sexy gal, and always felt a sort of tension between her and me.\n\nMy brother and her always had and on and off and unstable relationship. During one of their breaks, she decided to spend all her time with her best friend, which at the moment was me. One saturday night we decided to go out to a party with one of our friends. Since we were already clung to each other, we spend the party holding hands, sharing drinks, and smoking with boys and just altogether having a really great time.\n\nI was already planning on sleeping over her house so when the night ended we quietly got into her house, stripped our clothes and climbed into bed. We have always been very comfortable with each other and this was nothing out of the ordinary. We climbed into bed, got under the covers and she flipped open her laptop as we drunkenly tried to watch a show on netflix. I was spooning her from behind, and I was trying to watch the show but I was so drunk and high it was hard for my eyes to focus on the screen. Eventually, she looked up at my face and I finally saw the look in her eyes that she was craving me. I thought for a split second about my conscious and if I should do it, but gave myself the old \"fuck it, do what you want\" and stuck my tongue in her mouth, knowing that was exactly what she had wanted.\n\nGiven the fact that we were already half naked, it was already becoming an exhilarating experience. I felt all the parts of her I wanted to feel- her ass, her waist, her beautiful fucking tits, everything that I thought I was never going to be able to get. She was so soft and small and touching her while she was groping me just send waves of pleasure all over my body. My clit was already throbbing from how much I wanted her and how hot this night was getting to be, and it wasn't long until we were completely naked and making out in the privacy of her room. I was on top went from kissing her mouth, to her neck, to finally sucking and grabbing her perfectly pierced nipples. I could've spend a lifetime just pulling and licking her nipples as she moaned in pleasure. I have a bit of a breast fetish, and just sucking on boobs or getting my boobs sucked gets me really close to climax. Just thinking about it is making my clit throb again. Eventually I went down on her and not to my surprise, she was soaked. I licked her all up and let my tongue explore all around her pussy while I massaged her tits gently. I was pretty drunk and got really sloppy, but we have talked about sex with girls before and I knew that was what she liked. I kept sucking on her clit when I finally decided to slip my fingers into her vagina and just worked her up to finally make her orgasm. At one point, I was just rubbing her clit as fast as I could and I had her squirming around the bed and whispering yes over and over. Her legs were shaking and when she came she let out a whimpering moan and pulled me up to kiss her. I was so happy I was able to pleasure her. She started to work on me, only she was a bit more rough because she knew what I liked. She flipped me over and spanked me, as she licked my ass and pussy and just fingered me so hard and so good. \"Do you like that? I bet you like that. Tell me you like it,\" she kept telling me and it just added to all the pleasure I was feeling. It didn't take long for me to come and we spend the rest of our time switching positions from 69 to doggy to scissoring to any other position we can think of. Being with a girl was amazing because of how many times we made each other come. It was like a sexy ass porno.\n\nWhen we were done we slept together in the nude and woke up and smoked some more. To this day, my brother doesn't know and we are still very good friends, but that night is definitely one that we will not have trouble remembering.","retrieved_on":1441331561,"ups":141,"saved":false,"over_18":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":9,"id":"26zv79","archived":true,"name":"t3_26zv79","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"author":"[deleted]","from":null,"is_self":true,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/26zv79/fucked_my_brothers_girlfriend/","from_kind":null,"created":1401586639,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rvlj","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":141}

I know it will sound very materialistic, but I would money to provide myself a safety net as well as being able to purchase stuff (a nice car (a mustang preferably), dirt bikes/motorcycle or two, fun things like that)\n\nSome Info: I am 18 and graduating high school. I will be attending an United States Service Academy and afterwards have a five year active duty commitment. During the next four years during college I will have no financial commitments. I plan to study a field of engineering, possibly electrical. I will earn approximately 900 dollars a month, but after taxes and other fees, will earn about 200 dollars a month/2400 dollars a year. \n\nI don't really have a concrete plan, but I really would like some advice. My plan is to attend the Service Academy, save most of, if not all the money. Invest that afterwards into multiple stocks and possibly small businesses (I honestly have little knowledge about the payout, but do know the risks involved). After the five years commitment I plan to either A - Continue my service, or B - Pursue an MBA, or possibly a grad degree in engineering (possibly petroleum due to interest from having talked with several Petroleum Engineers). \n\nI also currently have ~4000 dollars in a savings account, but I plan to keep that as a safety net/miscellaneous fund.\n\nI would be lying if I knew exactly the path I wanted to take and I know it sounds bad to want money, and I understand if anyone takes it that way, but I'm really trying to set myself up for the future. I've been given an opportunity and would like to utilize it as much as possible. I also understand being happy versus having money, and am still considering the possibility of getting into something I may or may not enjoy (the MBA path specifically). Any advice or criticisms are welcome.

After 2 years of long distance and traveling we got married and she moved here with me. Things were fine mostly, whenever she said she missed her family I told her she could go see them (which she did each year for 3-4 weeks). Before we met she had a best friend but him and her told me they only saw their relationship more as family than anything else so I didn't make much of it (I mean she married me over him). Last July, I find out she cheated on me when she visited her family with another of her friends from the city and then after, I found out her best friend was always in love with her but she never told me about it so I wouldn't be alarmed. I recently found out she and him had a few fooling around sessions as well (I wouldn't be surprised if it was more) but that's what she admitted after denying it from the start.\n\n\nOnce I found out that there was more than a few occasions I called it off after she refused to not cut ties with all the guys I know she spoke to frequently (I had lost trust at that point) so I told her to leave, so she went back to her parents and told them we didn't work out. We spoke a few times she left (to work out items, finances and such, but nothing really got sorted). I tried to get answers from her, she always looked happy and I thought we were a good couple who could trust each other 110% but I guess I got played there.\n\n\nLast month she contacted me asking what was happening with us and if we were done for good, she wanted to know how I was doing. I told her I don't know, to me marriage means a lot, I really wanted only 1 girl and I was really happy with her but now I know she slept with more people since going back (a few of her friends sympatized with me knowing what I have done for her while her family hated me because I sent her back).\n\n\nI can't get my mind clear and I don't know if I should go back with her, if it's worth it (considering I will be 31 and I always wanted kids and a family, I feel that she stole this from me). I don't know if I should consider going back with someone who slept around while still married or if it's something I shouldn't think about.\n\n\n---   \n**tl;dr**: My wife cheated, we separated but now thinking of going back after talking again, I also know while separated she slept with more people. I can't tell if she wants me because she's in love or she realized I was really a good person.\n\n*edit* thank you everyone for the replies, I appreaciate the help.","media":null,"ups":36,"retrieved_on":1441331547}

Shocked, I asked him, \"How old are you, kid?\"\n\n\"I'm 12.\" He responded with. (as much as I love Benchwarmers, this did not make me laugh). I *immediately* became livid.\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK? What are you doing in here?\" I yelled, turning my attention towards the budtenders, \"What the FUCK are you guys letting him dab for?\" \n\n\"He has parental permission, and a signed rec. It's cool.\" The budtenders had the audacity to respond. After this I lost my shit completely. I went *off* on these two guys who were clearly stoned out of their minds. I don't even remember exactly what I said after this part, but I do remember getting so heated that I was escorted out by their armed security guard.

This is merely to give a perspective.\n\n\nSo to start off I already have pretty thick hair, but it has definitely started thinning out, I noticed, but other people including my GP said it's just \" A Maturing hairline\" I was really nervous but I went to a dermatologist and he said I'm definitely exhibiting a little bit of MPB. I'm 27 and still have a full head of hair, but this way I intend to slow the process even more. My brother is younger than me and has lost a lot of his hair, my father is in his 60's and has very very little left.\n\nI started doing fin 1.25 mg and I take it at night before I go to bed. First few days I didn't really notice anything. Then after a couple days I started maybe thinking I was getting a bit of brain fog. I started to freak out but I'm also kind of neurotic and a bit of a hypochondriac. I find that when I don't eat all my meals in a day or get less sleep (surprise surprise) the \"brain fog\" effects are more severe. I'm willing to chalk this up as something that isn't really fin related.\n\nSex Drive; I'm not gonna lie, for the past few months I've been kind of low ambition so I end up staying home all day and fapping and being on reddit. I know it's not an entirely attractive trait but lately I've been getting more and more busy and I haven't really had time to fap. Have I noticed a bit of a decrease in my libido? Yes maybe. However I don't have a girlfriend and it honestly doesn't bother me. Sometimes I can't get fully hard, but other times I'm really hard. I am curious as to how much fin is playing a part in this, and how much is just based on me being oversaturated by pornography and what have you. I'll do another up date in a few weeks. \n\n\nSo basically when it comes to my libido being lowered, if it *is* the case, it's not really something I have a problem with, if I really want to fap I do, but otherwise I'm ok with using my time to get work done etc.\n\nSo all in all, I'm basically saying \"this is what I've been experiencing thus far, it could be the drugs, it might not be as well\" These are just the things I've taken note of. I have to say it's worth it for me. I keep telling myself that I'm going to have great hair for a long time and that feels really great, when I have a partner and if I have to take viagra or something (big if there) that's going to be a discussion at that time, but currently in my life I am good with what little side effects I've been experiencing and am glad so far that I'm on it.\n\nMy current regime is pretty close to the one in the sticky thread.\n\nI dont know if this is useful or not, maybe. I found that the more I read up on it the more I was scared, but I'm one of the people who finds it to be pretty manageable so far. \n\nIf you have any questions I'd be happy to answer them.","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/tressless/comments/26zy0n/my_experience_after_being_on_fin_for_three_weeks/","title":"My experience after being on fin for three weeks.","secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"domain":"self.tressless","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1401585384","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"tressless"}

I live with my mother, my sister and my 1 year old nephew. I am unemployed and working on it. My girlfriend just moved back to the city, I felt really bad for her having to be here through all of this shit. But she's out, so that's good.\nHowever, I am having a very difficult time dealing with the negativity that I hear coming from my sister and her shitty attitude.\n\nMy sister is 30 going on 14. A colossal bitch. She has serious mental issues and in my opinion, takes them out on her kid who couldn't be sweeter. She screams at him instead of being sweet to him to fall asleep, eat, etc. She has serious jealousy issues with me because I seem to be the only semi-intelligent person in my family(I come from a family of country-folk, as I live in the south.) She's unemployed and sits in the basement all day every day getting fatter and fatter. SCREAMING at a 1 year old. She has never lived out on her own, never paid rent, barely ever held down a job, looses friends(and boyfriends/the baby's daddy very easily.) She is just a ruthless, mean-hearted individual. It's only gotten worse since she had this kid. I know she's really depressed because her boyfriend left her after and lives in her mom's basement and etc etc. But she won't accept help from ANYONE either, so it's really difficult to deal with. \n\nMy mother is in her 50s. She is the most caring, loving, selfless individual I've ever met. She provides a home, food, comfort and loving support for her and her kid. She loves her grandson more than life itself and my sister uses him to run all over her. For instance, if my mom can't watch him for a night so she can go out and get drunk, she keeps him away from her for an entire weekend. Some serious fucked up shit. The list goes on and on. \n\nThe worst thing about all of this is, is that my mom will NOT truly stand up to her. It's super fucked up. She feels so bad for the baby that she lets my sister fucking BULLY her into getting her way. It really, really makes me angry because my mom has done nothing but been an extremely kind-hearted person to everyone and does not deserve this shit. It's pushing her into extreme alcoholism and depression.\n\nI feel like there's nothing that can be done, because my sister has no intention of talking to anyone or getting help. \n\nAs far as my situation goes, I am going to just get a job around here and save some money to get out on my own again, but I can't help but feel so lost in what to do for my mom and more importantly the wellbeing of my nephew. I mean, he has fucking night terrors and has blood curdling screams in the middle of the night and I think a lot of it has to do with her negativity. I don't think she is physically abusive or anything like that, but just her energy is so fucked up that it rubs off on him.\n\nAny advice/similar situations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot!\n\n**TL;DR** 30 year old sister is a giant bitch and takes it out on her 1 year old son, taking advantage of my mother and I'm here witnessing all of it because of financial reasons forcing me to move home.

For the past three years I've slowly been coming out of the other side of some pretty serious issues with depression and anxiety and finally gotten to the stage where I'm really comfortable in myself (for the most part, anyway.) I've been at uni for two years and in that time I've gone from never having kissed a guy to having kissed several, gone on dates with a number and having long-term hook-ups that never really amounted to anything with two guys.\nIn all that time, the guys I really liked were always the overconfident but slightly shallow guys who weren't that interested in me. I'm reasonably attractive but I'm also relatively tomboyish, in that I grew up playing video games and I'm definitely not the giggling blonde in the corner. All of the guys I'm interested in are interested in a girl who they feel they can protect and take care of and who needs them- I'm super independent. I always end up being friendzoned, essentially.\nAt the same time, several other guys have told me they really like me, but I'm just not attracted to them. I've generally said no as kindly as possible, but recently a good friend of mine has confessed to having been head over heels for me for over a year. I feel something for him but I'm not sure whether it's platonic affection or more than that, so I decided to give us a go because hey, why not? He treats me like a queen and tells me amazing things no one has ever said to me, and guys always complain about being friendzoned like I do, so I figured I'd give it a chance.\nHe's ecstatic, but being super clingy and needy and it's freaking me out a bit. I asked him to tone it down but he hasn't. His whole demeanor has changed, he's acting like he's living in heaven on earth... And here I am still feeling pretty uncertain as to whether I even feel anything for him and dreading that I might have to end it and absolutely crush him out of this happiness.\nI want nothing more than to adore him right back. He's sweet, relatively attractive, and treats me like a god reincarnate. But I just don't think I feel it and it's both frustrating and depressing because I want to be the person he idolises me as being, I really do, but I'm just not. I feel like he's put me on a pedestal and he's pressuring me to stay there when I'm just not the person who he wants me to be.\nPlease MMFB...

ANYWAYS, I guess it would be good to tell my predicament that I would like some advice on.\n\nThis summer, I am traveling to the east coast, where the long distance girlfriend lives. I am traveling there with my mother to look at some colleges in the area because I am going to to attending college in either Massachusetts (which would be ideal) or New York. She is super excited, as am I, but we are both worried that we might not even be able to match up times and meet.\n\nBoth of our parents are VERY against long distance relationships, but we know that if we had meet in person, our parents would love us together. We share the same interests, think alike, and love each other so much. So the issue is more of our parents seeing us together and them not knowing who is the world the other person is that we are hugging/kissing/publicly cuddling with. xP\n\nWe met about a month ago and have only grown to love each other even more since, we couldn't imagine loving anyone else so much. Both of us didn't even know it was capable to love someone this much. I know this sounds all lovey-dovey, but just trying to get the point across that this isn't a relationship fueled by superficial feelings. ;)\n\nI'm posting this both as an introduction and a curious post to see if anyone has been in the same predicament. I am 16 and my SO is 15, so simply driving to the other won't work out too well.\n\nThanks! &lt;3","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/LongDistance/comments/27011l/first_post_gonna_be_near_her_this_summer_but_not/","title":"First Post: Gonna be near her this summer but not sure if we will be able to meet.","secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"domain":"self.LongDistance","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1401587730","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"LongDistance"}

Last night, I went to my LGS to play in our FNM with my Mono-Green deck. I don't have much money right now, and I managed to scrape this together for FNM a few weeks ago, in which it went 2-2.I really just went for the fun of it, because I knew that the chances of me winning ANYTHING were quite low. Many people at my LGS have spent $300&lt; on their decks, so it is a long shot for anyone with a deck under $80 to win. So I show up, and the number of people is actually a little bit higher than usual. Cool. I pretty much know everyone there, so it's looking like a normal FNM to me.\n\nMy decklist: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/21-05-14-hail-hydra/\n\nOur meta is a little bit screwed up, but it is healthy. Everyone runs somewhat different decks. I get paired up, and sit down to my first opponent.\n\nEsper Midrange Humans. My worst matchup is probably control, and his deck has plenty of it. Lucky for me, my deck is a turn 5 win when given the right hand. I won the first game, but the second game gives me a bit of trouble, as he topdecks 3 Verdicts. I held back after the first Verdict, so I was able to come back after the second and beat him before he casts the third.\n\nOn to my second matchup: U/W Control. Uhhhg! I knew the dude who was playing this, and I know that I have to RACE to beat him. I seem to always get paired up with this guy, and usually I beat him in round one, and he sideboards and then manages to keep me off for the next 2 to win. This one, I won as usual in round 1, and lose in round 2. I've basically accepted defeat by now, so I wasn't expecting to win. But then I got it: The perfect hand. Forest, Forest, Mystic, Tusker, Exp. 1, Boon Satyr, and a Reverent hunter. This is the hand that I dream about! So I have him down to 10 on turn 4 when he Verdicts. I kept the Satyr and now have 2 Centaurs. Play the Centaurs, and pull a Ranger's Guile. He tries to D-Sphere, and I Guile. Next turn, I get a hunter and play it for 5 +1/+1s. I get him down to 4. I can see the light now. I have 3 mana open, still with a Satyr in my hand. Next turn he Verdicts, and he tapped his mutavault to play it! I boon satyr and hit him for 4 to win the game. Sweet.\n\nI got paired up with a B/R Minotaur deck (I told you the meta was screwed up.) I won game 1 and 3 to be playing for first. He wins round 2 due to me topdecking 7 lands in a row :P \n\nI play against mono-white weenie for 1st place. This probably was the most interesting matchup as he can get a lot of creatures out quickly. I actually thought I was gonna lose this one because I have to get a decent hand to keep up with him. In game one I win by double aspecting for 16 on turn 4. The Reverent Hunter is actually the star now, because he really can't do anything to my devotion. On game 2, I lost. He sideboarded lifelinkers and first strikers as well as some removal. I got some fogs in there, they actually cause HUGE game changes in this matchup. In game 3, everyone's games are over and now everyone has migrated over to watch our game. We both have our own little fans (it was fun!) I got 2 Giant Growths in my opening hand and they provided AMAZING creature trades. I ended up just overrunning him and won the game.\n\nI couldn't believe that I actually won!!! For me to use the scraps of mowing money to make a deck by myself and WIN with it... that is a great feeling. I won the Tormented Hero and $32 store credit (in exchange for 8 packs). I think I'll use the money to draft Conspiracy when it comes out. Now I just need a mat!

I have a 29(9/11/9) and 28 (10/7/11) mcat (28's from my retake) and I put a huge amount of time into studying for them. I have a 3.62 gpa from a good school (3.73 scigpa),  great ECs which include over a thousand hours medical volunteering and scribing, huge amounts of community service such as starting a small program give students who were expelled from high schools, leading beach cleanups, good research in global health and environmental sciences (researched a watersupply in NY and whether or not it adopted environmental friendly policies. I was going to be published but there was a lot of dept drama) + plant bio research, hobbies including learning and studying other languages including arabic, farsi, german,and italian and their cultures, and very strong recommendation letters. I also have a strong personal statement and nearly all my secondaries (around 50 of them) are prewritten. My question is how long will it be before I know if I have a chance at any medical school and what should I do to make up for issues w/ my application if I don't get accepted anywhere? I'm submitting my AAMC application right away and same for my aacomas though I would much rather go MD, especially with the effort I'm putting into this (not to sound entitled but from moment I get up till the moment I go to sleep I'm doing something related to medical school).\n\nI'm really worried about finding out I have zero chance at a MD school super late and having no time to better my application the next year and just being stuck copy and pasting the recycled stuff as the year before. What can I even do to better my application anyway? If I retake the mcat I might do worse, since I've already gone through all the study material  available multiple times (havent looked at it since late march thankfully) and if I take it too late i'm stuck with the 2015 mcat crowd without sociology courses taken, which im guessing medical schools would see as a disadvantage and the 2015 mcat looks hellish. Are there post-bacc programs at each school that could give me a really good chance of getting into their medical school? when could i apply to those? Do i need to take the gre? What could I even do to convey I've improved my application?  Do I need to do a significantly more ECs? I'm getting tired of doing some of my ecs, and last week I drove around 100  miles to a hospital to be given absolutely nothing to do. I'm getting very frustrated with this entire process and am hoping even if I dont get in to enjoy being my age, instead of being hammered down with obligations and having zero time to enjoy myself because I'm putting everything I can into getting into medical school (this is like the past year+ in a nutshell for  me).  \n\nI'm still a bit pissed about my mcat scores too considering how much time and effort I put into while everyone on SDN seems to be getting a 31+ and still complaining about how bad their score is, and the whole new median for MD school acceptances being a 33.

It doesn't look like they're the closest of friends but they have similar social circles. As far as I know, they haven't talked about me in some way with each other. I like both of them equally and not sure how to handle it from here. As far as I see, I have 4 options:\n\n1) Keep dating both, but it may get messy later when/if they find out.\n\n2) Pick one to go exclusive with. However, if things get serious with the one, I may run into the other through parties, social events, etc and that would get awkward.\n\n3) Stop seeing both, which I'd rather not as I like them but maybe this is the best option unfortunately.\n\n4) Tell them the awkward truth and see what happens from there.\n\nWhat do I do? If it matters, I'm 27, both girls are 22. I've spent one night with both of them (separately obviously), no sex, just make out sessions.\n\nEdit: Formatting\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the suggestions.

I always wanted a server with a host but could never afford it sadly. Things about me is that i can really moderate and build amazing things. I know secret tips to make this server a popular server. I know i just joined but you should really atleast get to know me better through this long road we are going to be co-workers. Yes i am in it for the popularity but isn't that what all the server owners are basically looking for? I can get people to donate left and right and you don't have to pay me anything. I just want the server to get to a amazing level. When i was co-owner of krpvp with skruble and kingvitiate i really helped them out but i wanted to start over. So i quit for a longtime until finally i moved to make my own server. I had a 25$ host which hosted about 75 people we had full slots but soon enough i couldn't afford it anymore. So now i'm looking for a new server to start anew on my journeys.\nWhy you should get to know me?- I am a really good staff member. I don't abuse i listen when other players are talking, I don't ignore when they're are hackers on I do /vanish and tp to the problem and investigate myself. Hackers are a main problem on servers which cause players to leave alot of the time. This server I want it to be my Summer project Before i move on to 10th grade. Whenever a plugin is needed to be added that i think will help out the server i will notify you and tell you ways that it will really improve your server. I can find you coders later on when the server gets more popular to code you custom plugins for your server. I can get builders to build a amazing spawn that really catches the eye of the beholder. I can be on the server most of the day trying to advertise and get more players while you do your owner work.\nInfo about me?- I am 16 years of age. I am currently learning about java in this class that i'm taking. I live in florida and i spend most of my time either outside or playing minecraft or studying. I have skype but my mic is broken i can communicate with you over skype though when your not online and I am a really mature person and can enforce the rules strictly.\n\n\nIgn-Jorelmorell555\nSkype-jorelmorell555\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","permalink":"/r/SpitefulPvP/comments/2704sb/jorelmorell555s_adminmod_application/","link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"author":"jorelmorell555","from":null,"id":"2704sb","archived":true,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2704sb","gilded":0,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"num_comments":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"quarantine":false,"score":0,"edited":1401656951,"stickied":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/SpitefulPvP/comments/2704sb/jorelmorell555s_adminmod_application/","secure_media":null,"created":1401594538,"subreddit_id":"t5_31rat","from_kind":null,"from_id":null}

I've had acne since I was about 13/14 years old. And now I'm 23. It's been constant for that long. I've had ups and downs though. When I took Accutane I noticed it helped my back acne completely but my facial acne came back soon after. Basically I suffer from severe facial acne, all over my face, and every now and then a very painful and very big cyctic acne bump on my chest or stomach. I also have tiny little cysts under my skin all over my chest and stomach but they aren't noticeable from far away because they are so deep under the skin. \n\nI've been on a very high dose of Spironolactone before (200mg a day) but only noticed a slight improvement. Nothing to rejoice about. But since getting off it, it's gotten worse. I'm currently on Birth Control and that is doing absolutely nothing for my skin. My skin is so bad I don't even want to leave the house. \n\nI really want to know if any of you have ever tried something where you didn't have to take medication, but your acne improved or went away. Something like a certain diet, cutting out certain foods, a special skincare routine...etc\n\nCurrently I am on day 5 of cutting sugar completely out of my diet. I haven't noticed any improvement...yet. We'll see how it goes. I just feel really helpless right now...","media":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.PCOS","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1401594435","subreddit":"PCOS","media_embed":{},"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Are There Any Non-Medication Ways To Treat PCOS Acne That Have Worked For You?","thumbnail":"default","downs":0,"distinguished":null}

I've had baby fever for a little over a year now. When we got married, I really wasn't interested in kids, and we talked about how it just wasn't something we were planning on. But now it's all I think about.  I really don't want to miss my window and my dh is on the fianc\u00e9. He really doesn't see the point and doesn't get the urge.  He had said in the past, when he was 35, we'd try. Then it became the summer, then the end of the summer, pretty much anything to delay. Today I broke down.  I think I cried not only because I've realized that he really doesn't want to do this  but that I'm heartbroken and mourning  the loss of a child we' may never have. He said today to not rule anything out, and that he's still thinking about it. We've been married 8 years, together 16... I married him, and love him and our life together.  I just need advice on how to cope. If this isn't the right sub reddit,  lmk.
