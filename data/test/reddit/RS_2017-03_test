I remember I used to eat write and draw with my left hand when I was very little but my mother being a very strict Christian and my father a military man I would get name called and slapped anytime I would use my left hand. I have used my right hand through out all of my life because of that. I'm 21 now.

All of these things developed gradually starting at age 15; I am 27 now. First it was the dairy: couldn't have milk, then couldn't have ice cream, then chocolate, finally cheese. Only dairy that is totally \"baked away\" (like in a cupcake or bread) is OK. Then it was the soy, starting at 22.\n\nAt age 24, I was diagnosed with GERD. I was in the process of having tests done with a few upcoming ones already scheduled with my doctor when I had to go to the ER because my abdominal pain had become so painful, I was afraid something worse was at hand. Therefore, between my doctor and the hospital, I had multiple chest x-rays, an abdominal ultrasound, and an endoscopy. (Did not have a barium swallow.) It was determined my 11-year NSAID use for my chronic migraines just gutted my guts.\n\nLast year, at 26, I was diagnosed with IBS on the strength of having 3 immediate family members with it. My doctor ruled out celiac disease and following the low FODMAP diet helps control the diarrhea.\n\nBut I just feel so worn out, exhausted, and weary from these issues. My diet is supremely limited (I can't tolerate any beans, any peas, broccoli, apples; garlic or onion even in tiny amounts can be a bother) and I'm feeling lately, \"why not eat that dairy-free soy-free hot dog, so what if it has garlic powder in it\" and \"so what if tomato sauce bothers you like no tomorrow, have that small slice of Daiya pizza.\" I feel there is no end in sight. I did a few courses since the GERD diagnosis of Prilosec and/or Dexilant, and I take anywhere from 3 - 14 Tums a week depending upon my severity. I also drink over 1 gallon of almond milk per week because it helps with the acid and pain.\n\nI sleep semi-upright (also for my sinus issues, so I can actually breathe at night), I've watched what I've eaten for years (but within the last 2 weeks or so, just kind of given up and slacked off slightly). I haven't had alcohol in three years, I never smoked, and the only beverages I drink are nut milks and water (even ginger tea causes pain and bathroom issues). I'm 27 but I feel 207.\n\nI don't know how I'm supposed to go on like this for the rest of my life, however long or short that might be. Has anyone else ever felt this low because of how limiting it is? Or felt hopeless after awhile of \"being good\" and thinking if you only do XYZ, you'll feel better?\n\nThanks for reading all this.

You take a gym, you select 6 mons that are slated to defend it. In the event of an attacker challenging you, you are able to defend it in real time with the team you have pre-selected. Obviously, prestige gain/loss would be much greater so that it doesn't take hours to take down a gym. Maybe, if you are the highest level trainer, the attacker gets a lot more prestige for challenging you than a lower level trainer in the gym.\n\nAlso, trainers on the same team could challenge each other for positions in the gym to 'bump' each other out depending on ability to win. You win against a teammate in real time? You take their position. Maybe afterwards, they get a chance to challenge the lowest ranked teammate to bump them back.\n\nI think this would make gyms incredibly exciting. They would be based on skill and ability and create real-time pvp battles that would be exciting and rewarding. The tedium holding gyms currently represents is depressing when it should/could be the most exciting part of collecting pokemon in an AR world.. I hold (10-14) gyms to collect every 21 hours to buy incubators to hatch better mons to hold gyms... quite cyclical and repetitive.\n\nTHIS should be end-game. I'd feel like a gym leader in the TV series and enjoy the game on a level that I've only ever dreamed about.\n\nEdit: Lower level trainers could select one of the higher level trainer's mons if they are challenged. IE: Trainer is 3 trainers below you in the gym, they get to pick a mon from each trainer above them during defense. This is incredibly rough, but if done correctly, it would create an awesome competitive environment for those that are done collecting them all and craving new battle content.\n\nTL;DR: Gym battles based on teams of 6 for the trainer; competitive between teams and enemies. Obviously, there would be a lot to hammer out when it comes to time spent, what happens if you decline to participate, etc.\n\nPlease comment to further this idea on the MANY variables I have left out! Battle mechanics, bonuses for defenders, penalties for not accepting defense x amount of times in a row, ways for lower levels to be included. I'm 39 and would love all players above 30ish to be able to be competitive.","id":"5wrpss","link_flair_css_class":"idea","edited":1488328481,"is_self":true,"hidden":false,"author":"GroeGroe","subreddit":"pokemongo","locked":false,"secure_media":null,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"media":null,"archived":false,"created_utc":1488327674,"brand_safe":true,"domain":"self.pokemongo","retrieved_on":1489598617,"contest_mode":false}

I've been drawing for 1.5 years and I mostly started drawing because of the fandom...\nI also play piano. I've been playing piano since I was 8. \nThat's the basic introduction of me. Now here's the problems with me that have been bothering me about me and the fandom I would love some answers on... at least some reassurance or anything because I feel very opaque at times. \nSoo... be warned this might be long...\n\nI was very scared of this fandom when I first found out about it. Despite that I still tried drawing my own character who became my fursona. I was very scared of it because I've been raised in Mormonism(which has a lot of issues that makes me want to leave especially since I'm mostly attracted to guys), and at the time I was like \"oh there's potential for bad stuff here. I should stay away.\"\nAs a result I just got slowly sucked in. It started as I uploaded my stuff to a deviantart and found a google + communitiy saying specifically it was for only clean furry art. I sorta got noticed by some people there. Mostly just the owner who went through posts. On deviantart I didn't do much. I followed one artist, which quickly became 5. I always would do like this 3 strikes thing where I'd go through their gallery and if I saw 3 things marked as mature I wouldn't follow that person. Which is kinda stupid in my mind now but anyways. . . I didn't draw often either and so I'd upload like... One thing very rarely. I didn't interract at all. I also watched Foxalbiazul's vlogs though so there's that... I didn't really identify as furry until like... 6 months ago to be honest.\nWhat scared me was I saw everyone I interracted with as adults and thought I was like an exception. I'm 15 and this fandom is mostly full of adults. I get super nervous speaking aloud and sometimes typing replies is hard because I'm so self consious. Other times I type stuff and I'm too open about things or things I was holding in just flow out and I feel super embarrased later for telling people about my troubles. (which makes people helping me very hard.)\nAnyways... My furry artwork didn't really take off until May of last year. I discovered an artist who made only clean furry artwork that wasn't overly toony and I learned how to draw muzzles better although i was mostly just tracing and copying their work/poses because I didn't know any better. One day this person did a journal on Deviantart where they said that the first 10 people to comment and reshare the journal would get thier artwork posted on another journal. So I did and figured why not?\nAnd that's when I actually started getting encouragement on my artwork. And it freaked me out because I didn't think my art was worth anything really. This was about May of Last year. \nAs a bit of background, I haven't had much encouragement from my parents to draw because they focus on my piano talents more, and my sister is instead the drawing/painting star of my familly so I'm pretty much on my own. I did ask for some art supplies for chirstmas, and got a couple of those art kits targeted for little kids. Sure Crayons are useful for some but I prefer colored pencils. I also have no idea how to use water colors/paints either so there's that. \nAnyways back on track: That artist showing some of my artwork in a journal helped a lot with me getting encouragement from other people who saw my stuff and it also helped with me finding out there were actual TUTORIALS on art stuff. Over the summer I did a lot of stuff on how to draw differnet things and learned a lot. I also learned about groups on DeviantArt and started posting my artwork there. \nI also was more willing to search up other artists as well because of stuff happening where i was discovering some damning evidence against the church I was raised in and started being less strict with myself. (and a rant about Mormonism... just is not appropirate here [sorry if there's any believing mormons who see this...]) This was about 6-8 months ago near the end of summer.\nI discovered artists like PandaPaco, Hukley, Thesepantsdontfit, ETC. I also started liking fursuits more and appreciated them. I got more into social media and followed furry groups on google+, Facebook, and even made a twitter and followed some of the furry people I found. \nHowever, here's some sad stuff. So when I found out all the damning stuff about mormonism, it left me feeling depressed for a while. I also was comming to terms with accepting myself as being bisexual. So it was a weird point because I always felt guilty for my homosexual thoughts, but now wasn't feeling guilty for my homosexual thoughts, but depressed because the church I was raised in was guilty of lying, whitewashing, and basically I was going through the \"my life has been built on a lie\" thing so I was pretty depressed.\nAnyways my parents noticed I was depressed and not wanting to dissapoint them with my lack of faith I basically told them my issues were because of the furry fandom. And BOY did I mess up. I basically said Deviantart was a Furry Forum and people were harrassing me for being mormon. At least, thats what hey heard. \n\nSo my parents didn't have a great outlook on the furry fandom.\nThings went decently smooth for a while though. I drew stuff, had encouragement from friends I'd made on Deviantart. I'd learned quite a lot of stuff too and as I look back I had a nice style develop at this point. I didn't need to reference much because I'd spent time over the summer learning about perspective, muscles, and how to color with colored pencils. \nI was also now in 10th grade, and here the Sophmores are the first year in the high school building (9th is the last year at the middle school building.) I had only 2 people at this new school that came from my middle school. So I had only 1 friend really and over time we've drifted apart over things that have happened. I started making new friends though. \nOne day, in about December I was in gym, and I was typically very bored in Gym. I was on the bleachers in the Gym drawing stuff since the teacher didn't really care at all. I talked to 3 people in this class. One of these people was also in my AP european history class as well. But we were just like... we talked. Not really friends.\nSo I was drawing and came to see what I was drawing. And as it turns out, me and the guy who was also in my AP Euro class were furries. this was like... new to me because I had never had a friend who was furry. We both started talking more. We're both very timid too so we sometimes just like... have a hard time thinking of conversational topics. There was one other girl who also was a furry but once our scheduels changed around in this semester I kinda stopped talking with her. I did try visiting her friends at lunch. And they started talking about hentai ;_; I felt so uncomfortable I haven't been back since. (and they even called me out for blushing and started talking about how I was virgin ears and such. I just was like \"NOT DEALING WITH THIS SHIT!\") \nSo I have one furry friend. He's a Dutch Angel Dragon and his story of how he found the fandom is pretty cool (what better way than having your cousin drag you to anthrocon?) He's also had a similar situation with mormonism although he's straight so he hasn't had to deal with the sexuality shaming. In december I also found a forum for furry teenagers and I've made 3 internet friends. I have 4 close IRL friends and 3 internet friends. There's also some of my friends from middle school but we are all separate and don't talk much.\n\nSo that leads to now. Last night I was watching one of PandaPaco's art streams and he was playing shakira, which was a new artist for me and I was a bit embarrased because everyone knew who she was except for me. And then people asked me about zootopia. And I've seen it once. I haven't seen it since becuase my mom considered it propoganda. when people heard that some questions were answered. and I felt like Absolute shit. I was feeling like I was making the conversation depressing, I felt self-consious, only a couple people really responded to me too so I was feeling like I was being annoying too. Like... Idk I had a bit of a panic attack with it to so, looking back some of my responses might've given the impression I had no friends, but I Remember saying I do have friends. some recomended I try drawing too, and that just made me think \"none of these people can understand, no one knows what I do with my life\" and then questions about what I wanted to do when I was older which I have no idea about either.\nEventually I just left in the middle of all this without another word. I didn't even announce I was leaving. Just turned it all off because I was panicing. Even as I fell asleep thinking about it made me panic and I just hyperventalated myself into passing out. \nAnd then all day I've been feeling bothered by this all. Talking with freinds didn't help and I've kinda just been everywhere trying to talk about it but I also feel hopeless because I get the impression everyone thinks I do this for attention. Hell everyone will think I'm doing this for attention because it's a random forum and I'm rambling on about myself and how I might think I have some issues and mental disorders, but I'm aware of htem and such... Ugh... I feel so calm typing stuff but once people start reacting to it I start panicing. I'll be just fine posting this and then once people reply I'll just start freaking out because I'm like \"are they thinking I'm weird? What WHAT WHAT????!!!\" \n\n\nsorry for the long post. . .

My name is Paige, I am 20 years old and  I am probably one of the most wild and outgoing sluts you'll run into. I am 5'5. I have brown hair with some pink and purple streaks going through it, blue eyes, like the color of the sky. Now my breasts are a hassle because I can go from B to C cups and my ass surely is my best feature, nice and jiggly, for a petite girl like myself, I have an ass that causes confusion and I love being spanked. I am also pale and have freckles. Which apparently is very hot. \n\nOh yes and I am a bisexual girl. But this does not mean I am going to accept messages from men. I am sorry, but I do not like role playing with guys. I don't care if you are a male willing to play female, I won't play with you. So if you message me, guys, you'll get a nice and kind \"no thank you\" from me. Being bisexual means that I want a male concept in the role play and those males will be controlled by myself (unless you want to share control). If you don't like to have males in the role play, I understand and we can work other out something else, but for the women who are also bisexual and like the idea of two girls having their way with a man. You will have my priority. But for all the lesbians, please, do not hesitate to message me either, you still will have my attention. \n\nNow here is a little bit more about me when it comes to why I think I'll be one of the biggest sluts you'll run into. When it comes to my role plays, I usually would like to add in all or most of my kinks. Now, my kinks can be wild for a lot of people. So if you aren't into them, please, respect me because I won't judge you for yours. And if you want to get into a role play with me but do not like a certain kink, let me know and we might be able to work around it or add in something else to make up for it. Now, here is my rather naughty list of kinks. Again, respect me and my kinks and you'll get nothing but love from me. \n\nMy Kinks are the following: Anal, Assplay, Ageplay, Bestiality, Choking, Deepthroating, Double Penetration, Gaping, Gagging, Gangbangs, Groups, Incest, Knotting, Hotdogging, Spanking, Public, Lingerie/Panties, Squirting, Tittyfucking, Risky Sex(bare sex), Creampies, Cumshots, Ass Worship, Competition, Cum, Face-Fucking, Face-Sitting, Gloryholes, Hair Pulling, Handjobs/Fingering, Kidnapping, Large Cocks, Masturbation, Mutual Masturbation, Non-Con, Rimming#, Sex Toys, Sloppy Seconds, Swallowing, Clothed Sex, Strap ons, Drugs#,and Teasing. \n\nNow, this isn't the full list of things I like, these are just the favorites. There are a few other things that I like that I couldn't think of at the time of writing this, so hopefully, we are compatible and like most of the same things. \n\nMy limits are hard, so I will NOT be using these at all. If you want it, I am sorry, but I won't be able to play with it. Though I respect your kinks, like I want others to do with me. \n\nMy Limits are the following: Watersports, Fisting, Gore, Death, Blood#, Poo and Pee (Anything bathroom related), Puke, Dom/Sub#, Bondage, Encasement, Cutting, and Innocence.\n\nNow I am sure some of you are wondering what the # means by some of the kinks or limits. It just means I have exceptions or details about them. And they are these.\n\n*Drugs- Will not play anything hard., will only involve weed.*    \n*Blood- Blood from first time sex is okay. Nothing more.*    \n*Dom/Sub- I do not play either. We will be equals when it comes to sexual acts.*    \n*Rimming- Will not rim a male.*\n\nAnd now, for the ending of my post. I am sorry that it is so long and I made you read so much, I promise that if you give me effort with your writing, we can have a lot of fun together. So, if you want to be part of this, please, send me something about yourself. I DO NOT want you to start the role play off and expect me to continue what you wrote. If you do, I will only reply with my reaction to the post. This is something I need to discuss and plan before actaully getting into. I love details and a plotline. I don't want to just go off of whatever is written. Now, if you have stuck around and read the whole thing, I want you to tell me about yourself, who you want to be in reference to my character. Your appearance and if there are any kinks you'd like to add in (as long as they aren't any of my limits) Again, please, I want you to discuss this with me and not start off something on your own because I have an idea of where this is going to start and if you give me an opening that I don't like, it will ruin my idea and probably my mood to play this.\n\nThanks for reading!","score":2,"link_flair_css_class":null,"id":"5wrw8n","is_self":true,"edited":false,"hidden":false,"subreddit":"AgeplayPenPals","author":"Myfundirtyaccount"}

I'm 18 years old and currently a senior in high school. I moved to my current high school from my old school district for the beginning of my junior year. I've always taken hard classes mainly because things have always come easy to me and if I couldn't figure it out, I could easily learn it and I would be right on track. All throughout middle and the first 2 years of high school, I was placed in advanced classes with only a few other kids who had the same academic ability as myself. By the time I was a junior, my GPA was a 3.9 *with* all of the hard classes included, so there was no real struggling or difficulty learning. \n\nNow, fast forward to my senior year, and I am just plain flat out struggling. I feel like I'm drowning around all of the things that I just can't do. I somehow made it through the first semester by just barely passing classes (GPA is now at a 3.2, still not the worst but there goes automatic scholarships for most colleges and universities). I wasn't taking anything away from the classroom and I would never really learn the lessons even though I tried to pay attention and I always took notes and studied. Right before second semester, I decided to visit a school psychologist to get some help or advice or something. I spent about 2 months with him and all he did was diagnose my with ADD and prescribe me adderall. I'm still not really learning anything and my grades are still continuing to be absolute trash... I also organized myself much better in hopes that it would work better (calendar, plan things out, color code notes, new notebooks for each class, etc) but nothing has really made a difference. \n\nI don't really like talking about this since it seems so personal, but I really honestly do not know what to do. I know that I'm capable of doing better on my work, but I just *can't*. I don't know how to describe it. I literally just feel as if I can't retain what is taught to me in class, even though I am paying attention and studying and taking notes etc. It's making me worry about college because if I can't do schoolwork now, I don't know how I'll do it next year.

This thread is not intended to make people upset, to judge, it is simply to vent almost 2 years of addiction.\n\nI have been a FF fan all of my life, since i was a kid playing FF1. Played every title up until XI. Life got too busy after that timesink. Spent countless hours of my life immersed in the \"Final Fantasy\" World.\n\nI started playing FFRK Global in April of 2015. Almost a day one player. Nostalgia. 16 bit toons, good stuff. Since then, a casual gaming experience has turned into an addiction. I have whaled on many of banners, \"achieved\" Gold MVP status (I wonder what the threshold for Sapphire is, lol). But, all the while, I've been addicted to chasing relics in this game. I can remember spending 11 leviathan packs before i got a 1st fusion sword. Halfway through, Itunes disabled my account and i had to call customer service furiously to tell them that i authorize the charges and how dare they block my account (this happened more than 10 times in my FFRK career). Didn't matter, i got my prize.\n\nI am a seemingly normal dude. MBA Finance, MS Accounting, over 10 years at the same fortune 500 Company in a financial role. Relatively successful. A beautiful wife of 8 years, 2 kids 6 and 2, and I'm 33. I drive a Mercedes AMG. Wife drives a Lexus truck. Live in a great home. No credit card debt. I say these things not to brag, but to build background.\n\nThen, last week we found out we were expecting our 3rd child (unexpected). What a blessing, and I thank whoever created us for this news. But, this moment in life got me to thinking. My mobile gaming \"addiction\" between global and JP has been taking up too much of my energy, time and willpower. And... maybe money.\n\nTonight I left work early, i had a few drinks with a couple of friends. I'm still sipping some scotch whiskey and chasing with a good lager. I am working from home tomorrow telecommuting because tonight, i am getting drunk.\n\nToday during work after a morning meeting, I decided i wanted Basch's lance. I picked up JP a little over a year ago (can't buy anything for that game, thank God), and i have Basch's lance. It's fairly good, so i figured i wanted it on Global too. I bought 3 leviathan packs, fairly routine; and closed my office door.\n\n9 pulls. 2/11, 1/11, 2/11, 1/11. 1/11 (off banner). 3/11 OSB!!. 1/11. 2/11. 1/11 off banner again. No Bursts, lots of dupes, an OSB, and No Basch's lance.\n\nI was a bit angry. I don't know why all of a sudden, but i felt stupid. I was generally realizing how stupid it is to blow $300 dollars on pixels on a Tuesday morning, or maybe i had an epiphany. Then it occurred to me. I never tracked how much i've spent on FFRK.\n\nMy wife knows nothing of it since she stays home with the kids, and I handle the finances. I figured a couple hundred bucks on my \"addiction\" a month, tops.\n\nWrong. Ran some reports on my debit card since April 2015. I have spent $21,612.32 on FFRK. That's not a typo. About $1000 bucks a month, average since i started since i started buying gems maybe a month in. I couldn't believe it. \n\nI scoured the net for some solace that there is someone else like me. Apparently there is, a .15% population of people addicted to mobile gaming guys, gacha, or \"whaling\". According to Forbes in 2014, .15% of the gamers account for 50% of mobile gaming revenue. I can't imagine that this number has decreased, probably increased (total revenue), but i couldn't find any newer studies in a quick search.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/03/01/why-its-scary-when-0-15-mobile-gamers-bring-in-50-of-the-revenue/#1c45128b4065\n\nSo, with child #3 on the way, and no Basch's lance, I made a decision tonight. I am not spending another dime on mobile gaming. Ever. I removed my payment information from Itunes. I came clean to my wife, who literally looked at me like I was an unclean drug addict and how can i do such a thing. I feel dirty. I feel stupid.\n\nI wanted to share my story, maybe someone else here can relate, maybe they can't. Maybe you'll get a good laugh. Maybe you'll call me an asshole and say i could have fed the homeless with all of the 400 5 star relics many combined 6, 7 and 8 stars, i estimate about 700 total 5 stars including all that i have used for Rosetta stones) that i have accumulated. \n\nThis is my story. And it felt good to tell my wife and to tell reddit/FFRecordKeeper. Even though i know no one here, sometimes it feels good to tell people bad or hidden things who share a common interest. \n\nI am a recovering whale.

Although this audience will be biased towards keeping the car, I want to seriously discuss the pros and cons of selling my Audi R8. Some of you may have read my original thread when I bought her: https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/3xsnb1/bought_my_dream_car_audi_r8/ and here is a small album of more recent pics: http://imgur.com/a/Kxv9w\n\n\nThis was/is my dream car. She is gorgeous, she is unique. And now I take her for granted. I used to love seeing everyone's reaction when I would drive by, jealous that they could see what the car looks like when in motion. I knew when I bought it that buying an expensive car wasn't the key to happiness but a year ago I needed to have it no matter what. Part of the reason I bought the car was so that I could prove to myself that eventually I would get tired of this material purchase and concretely realize that there are more important things in this life than luxurious purchases. I'm starting to get to that point.\n\nFrom a financial perspective: I realize I am I going to get some very different responses from r/cars than I will from r/finance. I can still afford this car. I am in no financial trouble whatsoever. But I am very young and am just starting to build my financial base for the future. I have a well paying job now with reasonably good job security, but I don't ever want to depend on that. I feel like my money could be more useful elsewhere. Is that what is important, though? People used to tell me \"Why don't you invest that money and have a lot more when you're older?\" and my thought was \"I'd rather have one R8 when I'm 25 than the option of having 2 when I'm 50.\" Would having an extra ~20k every year to invest or save be worth not having the outlet of a supercar in my driveway at all times? Would it be worth not having the approval of every guy (trust me, girls don't give a shit) that I see on the road? And that may sound silly, but I bought the car so that other people could see it and marvel at it the same way I would when I would see an R8 drive by. The truth is that I don't really care about the approval anymore. I am used to it, I expect it, I take it for granted. Now it's just an expense that I have to pay every month. I am afraid that when I do sell it, I'm not going to know what I got til it's gone. It has become part of my identity. Everyone at my work knows of me as the guy with the R8, my family members ask me how the car is. It makes me special and different. And I don't think I should depend on a car for that validation/distinction and I'm not sure if I still do. \n\nSo all that being said, which supercharger should I put in it?\n\nThat last part is a joke.

{"selftext":"I've been mulling it over for a while.  Years, really.  I'm 35.  They told me when I was young that it gets better.  It doesn't.  If anything it's just gotten worse, and I can't take it anymore.  The promise of a few more days that might be only 'okay' instead of 'hellish' isn't really enough to keep me going now.  The fact that ending my life is going to hurt other people isn't acceptable to me, but continuing to endure even less so.  \n\nI was molested as a young boy.  It left me physically deformed (phimosis) and mentally broken in ways even I don't understand.  It made me a weird kid, and I was tormented for it as a child.  I don't think I've ever gotten over it.  All of my interactions with people are colored by it.  I don't connect with people.  Even those closest to me never actually see beyond the pantomiming of normal human behavior that I clumsily enact to hide what's going on inside me.  Every time I've ever tried to let anything out, people have backed away or just shut down.  People don't know how to handle it.  They treat me like I've got cancer.  I guess I do, in a way.  \n\nI'm alone all of the time.  Partially by choice, partially because for all the talk of 'mental health awareness', most people don't have time to care for the broken.  It's hard work.  I understand.  Doesn't make things any easier though.\n\nI don't really want to die.  I'm fucking terrified, really.  I just want to live even less.  I don't really see a way out of the everyday reality of my life.  I've tried anti-depressants, I've tried self medicating.  I've tried sobriety too.   I can't afford a therapist and neither can my family.  I'm constitutionally broken and it's not going to change.  I can drown the pain with drugs, illicit or otherwise but it doesn't change my inability to function in the world or the ever present reality that my life will never be what I want as a result of that inability.  \n\nI'm a burden, a black hole of money and love that gets poured in and gives nothing in return.  \n\nIf I can't live a dignified life, then I at least want to die with some dignity.

{"selftext":"Wall of text. \n\nFirst time poster, can't say I'm happy about it. I'm 30 and my wife is 26. We have been together 7 years, married 3 and have a 2 year son. \n\nWhere to start, I'd say our relationship was pretty good up until 2 years ago. We were the couple everyone was jealous of. Shared same interest in nearly everything, spent nearly everyday together. We got married in what was our dream wedding, had everything we wanted and made it perfect. We conceived our son on our honeymoon and she gave birth to a perfect baby boy. \n\nNow I have struggled with depression my whole life and my wife was well aware of it and was actually one of my biggest supports in my treatment. It comes and goes but when it hits it can be devastating. I won't socialize or take care of myself and can barely function and can get very mean. She always picked up my slack when I would get down. After the birth of our son she was diagnosed with severe post partum (?) depression. She would be in bed for weeks, I would have to physically hold our son to breast feed till we decided to switch to formula so she could get herself straightened out. In this time I got a taste of what it was like to be in her shoes when I have my bouts with this and it was very humbling. \nOver the course of the next year we both sought individual counseling as well as marriage counseling. We weren't fighting per say but we were definitely drifting apart. We were having petty arguments over everything that would blow up into huge blowouts with screaming empty threats from both of us. We would address this at counseling and work through it, and few weeks later be back in the same situation. \nAbout a year ago my wife started to spend more time out of the house with out me. She would go to coffee shops with her friends, the hookah lounge or the gym. She signed up for yoga classes and would go running for hours. I would get home from work and we would basically hand off our son and she would leave and 3 or 4 nights a week not return till 11 or later. This caused more fights when I would question where she is spending all her time and why she wants to be away all the time and I would be told she is trying to have a life outside of being a stay at home mom. \nI become increasingly more angry. I would be working 10-12 hour days and coming home to a house with out my wife who had been my best friend for the previous 6 years. \nAugust of 2016 we went on vacation 4 hours from home, on day 4 we got into an argument, over what I don't even remember, and she left with our son and I was stuck 4 hours away from home with no car. I found my way home and when I returned she told me she wanted to separate. \nShe took our son and moved in with her dad, this lasted two weeks till she told me she thought she made a mistake and it wasn't what she wanted. She moved back in, we continued our counseling, things were looking up. We would still have the occasional argument but it wasn't getting out of hand. Then in December of 2016, she told me by text message that she wanted me to move out and she was filing for divorce. After some very big arguments over the next few days I moved in with a friend of mine. Since then we have gone back and forth, stay married then 5 days later get divorced. Rinse and repeat for two months. \nLast week we sat down and talked, for the first time in weeks with out arguing, about what had been happening with us the last two years. She told me that dealing with my depression had crushed her. That my actions and words when I'm in my slumps have taken a toll on her and she just doesn't look at me the same. That she had been struggling with it since our son was born and was trying to make herself stay. That's why she got so active outside of the house to try to avoid me. \nShe claims she still loves me, and that she will always care about me, and wants to be a part of my life, but she says she just can't be married to me anymore that I just bring her down with me. \nI have no reason to believe that anything is going on that I don't know about, and believe me I've tried to find anything I could to make sense if this, some action or affair or anything that I could blame this on. \nIn my heart I don't believe she really wants a divorce. I feel like she is just tired of the arguing, my depression and all the stress that came with the birth of our son, and I feel like her own issues with depression were never truly addressed. \nIt all just seems so crazy to me that after 7 years together and a child that she wants a divorce when I didn't even know up until 6 months ago unhappy she says she really was. \nI don't really know what I'm expecting by posting this. I'm just really confused right now and have a million things going through my head. My own depression has spiraled and I actually went today and my doctor changed my meds and increased my therapy to twice a week. I'm not sure how I'm gonna cope with this, she really is/was my best friend and the absolute love of my life. The future just looks real bleak with out her in it.

Over the past few weeks I've had what I've assumed are regular Braxton Hicks contractions. They haven't been painful (just uncomfortable) and some days I just get a few, but other days - especially followed by a lot of physical activity - they would come every 20 minutes or so. I never really gave it much thought. \n\nAnyway, on Sunday morning we walked quite a long way with the dogs and felt tired by the time we got back. I was sitting down outside and relaxing when all of the sudden, I was hit with what was unmistakably a real contraction. And it didn't start out small like you hear about - oh no. It went from zero to 60 very quickly. I had to literally crawl inside to my husband and I was dry heaving and gagging because the pain was so bad I guess my body wanted to throw up. I immediately started crying (not usually a crier) and no matter what I did, the pain just stayed. It came in waves but I only got about a 45 second break in between the intense moments. Halfway through this ordeal I realized I had to poop and I stupidly thought, \"Oh man, maybe this is just because I've been a bit constipated!\" Hahahaha. Yeah right. I did go to the bathroom but the contractions continued on afterwards. My husband helped me into a warm bath but it didn't help and I crawled out and ended up just on all fours on our bedroom floor, screaming, \"NOTHING IS HELPING!!\" The worst part was not the stabbing cervical pain (which did suck) but the BACK PAIN. It felt like my back was ripping in half every time a contraction hit. Ugh...it was sudden and bad and frightening, and I'm still scared of it happening again. I called L&amp;D and they obviously said to come in. \n\nThe contractions died down on the way to the hospital and I wasn't crying or blinded with pain anymore, but it was still like ... \"gripping the door handle in the car and yelling for people to get out of the way\" intense. My back was also still absolutely killing me. When we got there they hooked me up to the monitoring thing and my contractions were coming regularly every two minutes. They checked my cervix and I was only a fingertip dilated. They ended up giving me three shots of terbutaline 20 minutes apart which slowed the contractions to 4 - 6 minutes and took away the intensity, but still didn't stop them. Then they tried Vistaril; again, it slowed them temporarily but it didn't last. They then wanted to try procardia and said if that didn't work, they would move on to heavier interventions like magnesium to stop them and morphine to zonk me out. \n\nI was very conflicted at this point and feeling physically terrible. The terbutaline makes you feel wired and like your heart is going to explode, and the Vistaril makes you feel extremely sedated and slowed down. It was a rollercoaster both physically and emotionally. The nurse made it sound like they would just keep trying things indefinitely and monitoring me because it's their job to stop contractions if they occur before 36 weeks, and I was only 34+6. I was given the option of staying and having them try everything under the sun while monitoring me, or go home and stay off my feet and see what progresses naturally. (This was all through one nurse and the on-call doctor, who I never saw. I didn't see my actual OB until the next morning when she wanted me to come in.)\n\nI ended up going home and I've basically been a couch potato for the past two days. I've gotten them to slow to about 10 minutes apart and they aren't painful now. With all this said, I have a few questions:\n\n1. Has anyone ever had regularly spaced contractions for an extended period of time with no significant progress/dilation? My OB said these aren't BH contractions by definition because they're coming with regularity. But if they're not BH contractions, why are they even happening? And why am I not dilating at all? She didn't really know and said it's odd that they're so evenly spaced and didn't respond to the terbutaline or the Vistaril.\n\n2. If I'm physically active at all - even showering and blowdrying my hair, for example - they speed back up to about every 5 minutes apart with increased pain. My OB didn't want to put me on official bedrest since my pregnancy has been perfect healthwise up until this point, but did say to stay off my feet and minimize any activity. Because of this, she said I can't use the timing of my contractions to know when to go back to the hospital and I just have to go back when the contractions increase in intensity. But I wonder ... when most people head to the hospital with contractions 5 minutes apart, are they extremely painful by that point? Or just very uncomfortable? I guess I'm worried I'll wait until my contractions are extremely painful and by the time I get there, I'll find out I should have headed there sooner.\n\n3. When real contractions do hit, is it usually like a meteor out of the sky like mine was? I always thought it would gradually build up to that intensity level and my body just threw me right into it with no warning at all. It was a bit traumatizing because now I worry that it could happen again at any moment.\n\nIf this has happened to anyone else, I would really like to hear about it.","author":"daisypushers","subreddit":"BabyBumps","hidden":false,"locked":false,"distinguished":null,"secure_media":null,"brand_safe":true,"domain":"self.BabyBumps","retrieved_on":1489598878,"contest_mode":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"media":null,"archived":false,"created_utc":1488333100}

In high school it was pretty easy for me to get a girls attention , and I think this made me over confident, as in I would only shoot for the hottest chicks and I wasn't always successful. I had one sorta serious relationship with a girl 3 years ago. High school is over and now I'm a 3rd year Law/Commerce Student at Uni. \n\nI've hooked up with a few girls here and there, I've had the opportunity for sex in the form of a one night stand with below average chick, but I wanted to save it for something more meaningful. I've also tried Tinder and get a decent amount of matches but I just don't like using it so it doesn't go anywhere. I had a girl give me her number last year but I honestly was not attracted to her so I did not pursue it. \n\nI've lost a lot of confidence (mostly because I was teased a bit about my big eyes when I was around 13-14). Like I cant just approach a girl with the intention of getting her number. When I feel as though a girl is interested, I never know how to be proactive. I always fear rejection. \n\nI do go out with my friends, but we don't go clubbing that often so I am mostly around dudes nowadays. A few of my friends have had gfs but are also still virgins. I've been gyming for 3 years and am happy with the results. My mates tell me to just pick up chicks, but I am not that type of guy, like I have tried but using pick up lines, or grinding in a club makes me feel awkward. \n\nNow I genuinely want a girlfriend whom I can lose my virginity to. I feel as though I need to lose it, since I am 20. A one night stand wouldn't be ideal but I won't rule it out. I'm not ugly, but I would't say I'm very attractive - I've attached some photos so you can judge yourself - http://imgur.com/a/1vZDE\n\nAny advice would be great.

I like them when you cup my balls and pull me toward your warm wet mouth. I like them in the morning in bed when I'm half asleep. I like them on a train. Or on a plane. In the dark or in the rain. Or with a goat or on a boat.  Ok. Perhaps not the goat. \n\nI imagine taking you in the  car on a long open road while I gently stroke your hair. Then you unbuckling your seatbelt and leaning over the counsel to take me out. I like blowjobs when I come home from work still dressed in my suit.

Every year we all get together, pack up our cars and we go camping. It all started when we were kids, and we all met at summer camp. Our summer camp was eventually closed down due to a double murder-suicide that took place in the woods there. Apparently this guy took his family camping there, with the intent that he was going to slaughter them. He offed his wife and his daughter, and then shot himself. I was really young, so my parents never gave me the details. All I know is it was gruesome. We asked for one full week off of work. We went to our usual campground, Hidden Paradise. This was a campground my folks used to take me and my brother to when we were young. It was amazing there, there was a huge lake with a water trampoline and other fun water activities, there was a cage right when you pulled in with reindeer in it. They were pets and very well taken care of. My brother and I loved going to Hidden Paradise. \n\nHidden Paradise was in a very small town in Indiana called St. Paul, it was about an hour away from were we lived. It was the sort of town that you'd miss if you blinked. It was very small, they had one store, it was like a family owned gas station. I don't even know if they sell alcohol there. My friends and I packed up our cars and we set out. The drive wasn't too bad, we took the interstate most of the way. I was driving my car with my fianc\u00e9e next to me. I happen to be the only girl in our group of friends, but one of our friends brought his new girlfriend along, so I was excited to have someone I could relate to. Sometimes I get tired of hearing farts and burps and boy talk. \n\nWhen we arrived in St. Paul we stopped at the family owned store to pick up some firewood. It's against the rules to bring in your own, to prevent you from bringing in wood eating bugs and such. The price for the firewood was outrageous but it's a tiny store in the middle of nowhere, so it was our only option. We made our way to the campground, the first thing that caught my eye was the fact that the reindeer were gone. I shrugged it off. When we pulled up to pay for our campsite and our cars, I noticed how vacant the place was. It is February, so  the place being a little empty made sense but when we booked our site online there were only 3 available out of the 40 sites. Anyways we settled in, pitched our tents and got a campfire going. Winter this year has been very mild, it's been in the 50s and 60s so we decided it wouldn't get too cold for us to stay in tents. Hopefully. \n\nWe checked in around 11am, so we started cooking a light lunch on the fire. Brauts, cheesy dogs, and burgers. My favorites. It was only 11am, but we had a whole week off so we all had a few beers. As we started eating, a family pulled into the site next to us. The older gentleman, I'm going to assume is the husband and father, said hello and we greeted him back. They started setting up their site but I wasn't until at least an hour after they had been there that they got their kids out of the car. There were three of them. They were really pale and skinny. They looked to be about 13, 9, and 7. I'm bad at guessing ages, so I'm probably way off. I'm 24 and I look like I'm 16, I can't even buy I pack of cigarettes without the cashier chuckling and going \"yeah I'm gonna need to see some ID\"\n\nIt was around 3pm when my friends and I decided to go on a hike. I realized I never introduced my friends, I'm all over the place right now so forgive me. Our group consisted of my fianc\u00e9e, Michael and our friends Charlie, Eric, Matt, Jake, Benny, and Benny's new girlfriend Tara. There were 8 of us including me, my name by the way is Jane. We all set out for our hike, we packed some snacks, water, and a bowl of our favorite recreational drug. We hiked for about two hours when we stopped to have a snack and catch our breath. We had much more of the trail but we all decided to turn back and start making dinner. By the time we returned, the family next to us was gone. All of their stuff was still there of course but we didn't see anyone else on the trail, and the water is far too cold to swim. \n\nSo far our first day at the site was pretty uneventful. We ate our dinner and started to play some music. Our friend Matt is a killer guitar player, and Tara is an amazing singer. That's when we decided to break out the liquor. We brought some makers mark, my drink of choice, some tequila, some rum, and some gin. We're not alcoholics, we just like to have fun. Obviously we didn't mix darks and lights, I didn't want to puke my brains out in the woods. I took a few shots of Makers and then I had about 4 beers. I was drunk, but not too drunk. I'm very good at handling myself when I drink, and I know my limit. That's when things started to get weird. I started to feel very fuzzy, I turned to look at Michael and I noticed he was starting to doze off. I looked around my friends and everyone was starting to slump over and sleep. Then everything went black.\n\nWhen I woke up I was in my tent, with Michael to my left still asleep. I searched around for my glasses (I usually put them in the mesh pocket on the inside of the tent when I go camping, so I don't roll over and crush them in my sleep) they were in the pocket. I put them on and searched for my cellphone. I checked the time and it was 10am. I woke up Michael and he was just as confused as I was. How did we get in our tent? Why did we both black out last night? We left our tent to check on our friends. Everyone was there.. Unharmed. Matt and Eric were making eggs in a little skillet over the fire, and everyone else was still asleep. I asked them what they remember from last night and they acted as if nothing weird had happened. They told me we all went to bed around 2am and that they saw me and Michael walk into our tent. That's definitely not how I remember it happening. Michael and I drove to the office of the site, they have some snacks for sale there and some other random things. I bought some candy and Michael bought some chips. When we were checking out I asked the woman working about the reindeer that we're missing when we came in. She told us that a few months ago, some guy from a wedding party got too drunk, hopped the fence, and slit the animals throats. \n\nI was shaking. I've been very drunk at times and never have I had the urge to slaughter a defenseless animal.
