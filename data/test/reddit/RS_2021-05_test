I'm 6'1, slim, blue eyes, long brown hair, and willing to exchange pics when we start talking. I'm ultimately looking for someone I can be with forever and devote myself to. I want to be your daddy and I want you to be my little girl.\n\nThe things I'm most into are ddlg and pee play so it's important you like those too. With ddlg I enjoy both the innocent caring aspect and the naughty more sexual side. I want to say sweet good nights to you and tuck you into bed at night, make sure your teeth get brushed and work gets done, play dress up with you and read you stories, take you to the potty, give you baths and attention and watch Disney movies together, play with your princess parts, and lick you clean if you've had a little accident.\n\nWhen it comes to pee play I adore pretty much everything about it. I want to make sure you stay hydrated throughout the day and deny you relief as your bladder swells and presses against your tight jeans. I want to tease you with a full bladder until you start to spurt and leak. I want to make you leak a little bit into your panties when you're out during your day so your wet panties rub against you as you walk and remind you of me. I want to lay under the stars cuddling you and make you piss your panties on top of me. I want to take you outside and force you on your hands and knees, pull your panties to the side and slip inside you and fill you with my warm piss. Just pretty much anything to do with pee it's immensely appealing.\n\nI'll be open and honest and trustworthy and expect you to be the same. Good communication is important in any relationship and especially so when it comes to dynamics. I want to get to know you both as a \"big\" and a little, sexually and non sexually, and if the balance ever feels off I trust you'll let me know. And if you missed it in the title I'm preferably looking for a virgin. It's important to me that I wait for my little princess and hope she feels the same.\n\nLooking forward to talking to you, and let me know who your favorite Disney princess is!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BDSMpersonals","subreddit_id":"t5_2smyd","subreddit_subscribers":160921,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"27 [M4F] Ohio\/Online Daddy looking for my little virgin piss princess for a long term relationship","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BDSMpersonals\/comments\/n26u13\/27_m4f_ohioonline_daddy_looking_for_my_little\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Standard practice. \n\nNow y'know you got the particularly heinous ones every once in a while that said some truly disturbing shit. Complete menaces of society beyond redemption or forgiveness, real pieces of shit.  \nBut even then after a while those came a dime a dozen. One of them however will always stick out to me though. He wasn't a particularly heinous person like described above, he was just very very strange and I have come to refer to him as Scabby.  \nWhy do I refer to this specimen of a man, this seemingly living scientific experiment as Scabby you ask? It's 'cause when he sent his arbitrary dick pic to me, he had scabs on his dick. So I ask him: \"Hey man you got scabs on your dick what the genuine fuck is that about?\".  \nMotherfucker hits me with that: \"Yeah sometimes I jerk off so hard I get burned.\"  \n\"What kinda supersonic speed was this motherfucker jerking off at to achieve the skin equivalent of a fucking carpet burn on his dick?\" is what I think instinctively. \n\nSo I ask for a video. He sends it.\n\nNever in my life did I think a man's hand could move that fast. It was like it was at the base and the tip of his dick at the same time. Like he was just gripping his dick with two separate right hands instead of moving his single right hand. I was witnessing the real life version of the anime trope of afterimages. I was in shock, baffled.\n\nHe sends another dick pic. A bloody fucking mess. He jerked it so hard the scabs came off and opened the wounds again. His hand was covered in blood as well. I was appalled, viscerally disgusted yet mortally intrigued. I couldn't look away, it was a car crash unfolding before me.\n\nThen he sends me the crown piece of our conversation. The Magnum Opus of the fleeting interaction we had. A video. A video of him eating the freshly ripped off scab. This man wasn't particularly heinous in his fetishes or anything, aside from the fact he wants to y'know, fuck kids. He was more the average run of the mill creepshow that I reeled in most of the time. Yet he was so much different. He really left an incredibly deep impression on me. This man was barely a man anymore. He was a man that lived for nothing but the ecstasy of orgasmic pleasure. He was too far gone to be saved, or to want to be saved. That is the tale of Scabby the Discord pedo. A sad tale really.\n\nAnyway after that video I gagged, nearly threw up and promptly closed that conversation and reported him with all 5 of my alts as well while I was at it. I wanted him gone off that platform. Yet I fear he's still there, lurking, eating scabs off his mangled bloody mess of a dick from overjerking it, stalking the haunted nsfw channels of various servers like the world's most disgusting cryptid. I sincerely hope he got help, because I had to get some after just witnessing this alien pretending to be a man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Scabby was a Discord pedo I baited and he had scabs on his dick from jerking off too fast. He also ate those scabs.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"teenagers","subreddit_id":"t5_2rjli","subreddit_subscribers":2517948,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Lemme tell y'all about Scabby","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.91,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/teenagers\/comments\/n26v06\/lemme_tell_yall_about_scabby\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I am 29 male. First i would like to say a little bit about my life history. I went to an all male school but did do some coaching and other things for my studies where girls were there. Went to college, went to work for 1 year out of town etc etc so I have lead a normal enough life. However I am naturally an introvert and I have never ever talked to a girl face to face before except for very very short encounters. I guess my total talk time with girls so far has been like 1 minute? i don't know.  \n\n\nThe thing is, I have had male friends and while I still feel a bit awkward being with one of my guy friends especially in a one on one setting (as I am an introvert), I can hold my own. However in the rare occassions when I had to talk to a girl one on one(say in a family dinner if someone introduces me to someone etc) then I just put a big smile all the time like an idiot. I am not able to utter words properly. At this point girls might as well be completely alien creatures for me, not joking.  \n\n\nHowever after so many years of living life, I have come to accept this fact and I am pretty happy with what I am and how I am. I am not asking for dating advice because I know that other men are way better in talking with girls and are way more charming and influential so a girl seriously has to have a bottom low self esteem to ever date me over those much better guys, this is not a problem.  \n\n\nThe problem is, my cousin's wedding is coming up in 2-3 months. Him and me have been very very close and have been playing since out childhood. He doesn't know that I am this much of a loser when it comes to talking with girls and I know for a fact that he will introduce his wife to me and we will have to talk. I am his close friend so he would also naturally expect me to be friends with his wife and this is the problem. I will definitely act like a complete moron and just smile a lot when she is talking and my weakness will be exposed in front of everyone. This thought is killing me. I can't leave his wedding since he is so close to me.  \n\n\nAny tips on how to avoid going to the wedding?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"socialskills","subreddit_id":"t5_2r275","subreddit_subscribers":2461216,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Never ever talked to a girl irl, need help so that I dont embarrass myself in cousin's wedding","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.83,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/socialskills\/comments\/n26vel\/never_ever_talked_to_a_girl_irl_need_help_so_that\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

Hi this is my first time posting on reddit ever. I have talked about my freakislhly weird parents to my friends. For the longest time I thought they were acting like any foreign parent in America- overprotective and annoying. My useless arse of a dad has been absent from my life for two years and all of a sudden wants to act like the best father in the world and control literally everything I do. Just because he drives me to work its as if he can get away without being a class a arse whole. I got my phone (which I spend all two summers ago saving up for) taken away from you.(mind you I have a job which I get calls for and I'm 18 years old) He's taken away my phone four weeks ago for going out with friends and not replying to his calls after which I got slapped so hard my cheek was bruised for a week. I can no longer go out with anyone who isn't family. I have to arrive home right at 3:00pm or I get the living shit beat out of me. He has these random outburst where he yells at me for things I didn't even know deserved punishment? Take for example- he found out I wanted to go to a college that's private and religious(super close to home because if I cannot go far away from him) He told me I was a whore for wanting to go to a school that none of my siblings went to and that I will become Christian?(my dads muslim btw) Honestly Im sick of it and at time I just want to end my life just to get at him and show how terrible of a father he is. My siblings all bow down to his feet and do all of his bidding(literally if he asked any of them to kts they probably would) When I told them about how what dads doing is wrong they gaslit me and told I've become too westernized and how I should respect my parents. I cry and scream and don't know what to do. I have a job where I get paid next to nothing and don't know a thing about saving money. I don't have my permit or license or car. Everyday I contemplate suicide and how its probably the best option for my sanity as of rn. I don't see myself living past my 20s in this household and don't know what to do. I am literally writing this on a laptop I brought just in case I get my phone taken away. I feel so anxious everyday in this household and I physically can't breath. It hurts to breath. I don't know how long I can take this. I have only about $400 in my saving as of rn and waiting till the day of my graduation(June 6th) to move out and try living in the dorms. I hope I don't kms. I hope I'm strong enough to get through this. If I don't and my friends find this- I love you guys- you guys helped me the best you could&lt;3","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_subscribers":697671,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"MY DAD SAID HE WOULD STAB ME TO DEATH IF I DIDN'T OBEY HIM","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/n26xx5\/my_dad_said_he_would_stab_me_to_death_if_i_didnt\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I plan on losing weight in the summer because I work a lot and do not keep up with lifting\/eating. In the fall when I go back to school, I am thinking about experimenting with ostarine. My local supplement store sells ostarine and I have had multiple friends cycle on and make gains. I am aware that there are plenty of scams and SARMS that are not lab tested, but I am certain that these are tested and the company is trustworthy. I would say that I am fairly cut with visible abs and veins on my forearms, chest, traps, calves, you get the point. But when I go to school in the fall I want to be disciplined in 4500cal a day with strict push\/pull\/legs lifts. My goal is to look exactly as I do now (body composition wise) and weigh in at about 170lbs. I am still gaining weight slowly and my numbers are improving slightly, but with this supplement I feel like reaching this goal is easily attainable. I do not even care about how much I lift (it\u2019s so sad how far behind my chest is lagging in comparison to my back\/legs). I am WELL AWARE of the side effects so please do not just say \u201cbad for you; just take tren;YoU cAn\u2019T sAy YoUr NaTtY;\u201d bullshit because I know this. The thing I enjoy most in life is working out in order to look better and I feel as if this supplement would help me achieve my goals.Now I plan on doing a 90ish day cycle (still reading and researching hence the reddit post) while following a strict diet and not drinking alcohol at all during this time. I will also take a small break from preworkout so that I am fresh going into this. I will not be taking pre for the time being as I\u2019d like to keep physical strain to a minimum (somewhat). Another statement is that I smoke weed as well and I am wondering if anyone else has taken SARMS and also smoked. I do not want to take steroids by any means (fuck needles) but I am aware using this will consider me not natural but, who gives a shit. Swole is the goal size is the prize I want to be scary looking in my mid 20s. Thoughts? Comments? Any personal experiences? Please share and thanks a lot.TL;DR: Will taking a short cycle of ostarine on a strict diet make gains that are noticeable to me?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"sarmsinformation","subreddit_id":"t5_hxxkp","subreddit_subscribers":1682,"subreddit_type":"restricted","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"SARMS (21+ responses only please)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/sarmsinformation\/comments\/n2745n\/sarms_21_responses_only_please\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I was pretty tired so I decided to eat then go straight to sleep for not more then an hour or two but instead my parents didn't wake me up and I just kept sleeping and my dream began.\n\n*I was with my mom visiting grandma, they were having a chit-chat and a smoke and I had a bottle of white wine which I brought today to serve them. I poured wine in one glass then when I wanted to pour in the second glass the glass wasn't very clean so I took it and went to wash it in the bathroom's sink, I don't know why. \n*I went in the warm-lighted bathroom and the first thing I did was stare blankly in the mirror. My intuition was telling me I shouldn't look that much in the mirror because it gives me bad dreams everytime, known from personal experience and also read it on the internet. I was getting a very bad vibe and a big feeling of fear was installing in my body just when I got a force pushing me from the lower back towards the sink and causing me to fall on the ground in a fetus position.\n*So here is another commonality from my nightmares, despite my big effort of trying to shout for help for my grandma, my neck felt like contracting and my voice barely did any noise. I was very well aware she wouldn't hear me so I started kicking the wooden door just to, you know, make some noise in the hope to be found and helped. \n\n*My dream ended and here I am at 3 in the morning writing it.\n\nI don t have nightmares often at all guys, I d say maybe a couple of times in a year but when I have them they are all related by a couple of things: I lose my voice from fear and through my desperate trial I fail everytime to make enough noise to be heard, mirrors trigger my nightmares ( Sometimes I see something, sometimes I don't see anyone, last nightmare I remember was seeing two young little twin girls wearing the same white dress and looking at me through a cracked mirror) and my nightmares happen in the same two places. The first place is my grandma's apartment (my mom's mother), and the second one is at the house of my great grandma and grandpa (my mom's) which both passed away  some time ago. \n\nI have to mention that 4 out of 5 nightmares fit in this pattern. I also had dreams where I had the voice issue but I wouldn't classify it as nightmares because I didn't wake up scared, just confused and a little startled.\n The oldest dream that fits the description given in this thread would be one which I had when I was around 5 or 6 years old, maybe 7, I made my way from my bedroom to my parent's bedroom.and I stood there trying to speak with them but they kept looking and me and not answering to my questions because they probably didn't understand, since as I said, my voice was lost again. I don't know how I remember this one but if I do I guess it's an important one. \n\nThank you guys for reading it all the way, first time posting here and I'd appreciate if you could help me figure out the meaning of these dreams since the fact that I don't understand them and they may hide an undiscovered part of myself unsettles me a little. Answering to all question as soon as I notice them!\n\nEDIT: Fell asleep at 8PM and I overslept till now.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Dreams","subreddit_id":"t5_2qmbx","subreddit_subscribers":222401,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Voice loss and mirrors, a common nightmare","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Dreams\/comments\/n274l1\/voice_loss_and_mirrors_a_common_nightmare\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I also get confused so when I was going to turn the corner after looking both ways I was going to turn and then she came around the corner and was trying to go straight and I got nervous and accidentally pressed the gas instead of the brake and went right into the front right side of her car. My friend got out of the car and started talking to her and she didn\u2019t seem all that worried I was really scared. The lady was a Lyft driver and said she had to get to work so we couldn\u2019t giver her our numbers but I told her which house I lived in and that if she wants me to pay for it I will. But she said that the dent was already there before I hit her I don\u2019t know how much I believe that. I think there was some frame damage to the car. But my friend did have a hundred dollars on her so we gave her that. She also tolled me that it was okay and I didn\u2019t need to be scared or worried and that the worst part was over. Will I most likely ever see her again or will she get me later without me expecting it?

I maybe quiet but when I find someone I trust I go all in. \n\nPhysically I am 5'9, 140 lbs., curly hair, with facial hair. I am not white.

Also looking for a cis woman. Physical attraction does matter so looking for someone that takes care of themselves physically.\n\nWhat I'm looking for. In the long run I would like to be in a Dom\/sub relationship. I understand that will take time to build and take time to get trust. If I can repeat this line a thousand times I would. If it doesn't come across clear enough not looking for a one night stand. \n\nOnce that trust is established I would want to find someone that gets pleasure from keeping me happy. Someone willing to try out new things that maybe out of their comfort zone. I would of, of course do my best to keep you happy as well.\n\nNot into inflicting extreme pain. More so the act of submission for me. Make sure we are both ok with constant communication.\n\nOutside of physical attraction there needs to be an emotional attraction. Looking for someone I enjoy being with and that can push me and support and I them. Looking for someone in a good career, intellectually intelligent, and independent. \n\nSome Kinks I am into and also want to explore:\n\n* Forced Orgasm\n* Orgasm Control\/Denial\n* Spanking\n* Cock Warming\n* Face Fucking\n* Public Sex, Exhibitionism.\n* Buying you lingerie and having you model for me\n* Buying toys that I can use on you. \n   * Would love to get a blue tooth vibrator that I can use on you in public and watch you squirm\n   * Biggest fantasy is getting a Sybian. \n* Rope\/Restraints\n* Breathe Play\n* Wax Play\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThink you get the picture.

am 2 years into both my social and medical transition.\n\n2 years ago I had a wife... and now I do not. She was very supportive initially after I came out and about 2 months into HRT did a complete 180. All of a sudden she wasnt okay with it and we ended up fighting... A LOT.\n\nBy the time I was 8 months into my transition we had broken up. During the 2 months prior to us breaking up it was absolutely brutal on me. The decision I made to transition cost me my family. It felt like my entire world was turned upside down. I was cutting and heavily contemplating more. It was a very emotional and dark time.\n\nAfter we broke up we continued to live together because our 3 young children. She immediately started hooking up with guys at a rapid rate. I was taking things slower and exploring my newfound interest in men. 6ish months after we broke up I met a guy and went on a date. It was amazing and one thing led to another and he eventually became my boyfriend.\n\n3 months after I went on that first date my ex decided she couldnt handle being around me anymore because all she could focus on was what she felt she lost. She left with a guy she met a week prior on Tik Tok at 5am on Mothers Day 2020. Left me, and left our 3 children.\n\nThat was incredibly difficult. I work full time and having the entire responsibility of the children to myself while not being able to afford childcare was daunting. I reached out to my job for help and a charity foundation inside the organization gave me enough money to hire a nanny for up to 4 months while I figured things out.\n\nMy lease was also up in 4 months and the plan came to fruition for me to move back home to PA (from NC) to be near my parents because I desparetly needed help. Luckily I work full remote (IT) and was able to continue working from PA. My family also helped scraped together $2,500 to help with the move and before I knew it I had moved.\n\nNow I have been living up in PA since September and my family has been a HUGE help. I dont pay for childcare at all because my mom comes over every day of the week to help with the kids while I work (she is a SAINT \u2764). That gave me the opportunity to pay my family members back for the move and get stable financially again. Needless to say things have been going really well.\n\nMy new house (renting) is much larger than the apartment we used to live in and I even have a garage! Fast forward through many great months between September and February. Many months of the stress of the previous year slowly dissolving and both the kids and I finally starting to regain happiness. Then in February I was approached by Planned Parenthood for an open cybersecirity position (my speciality). The offer was generous and I figured it wouldnt hurt to do the interviews.\n\nWell, two months later and my last day at work is next Wednesday. I am slotted to start at Planned Parenthood shortly after that. The new position is going to bring me to a level financially that I have never been. Also I finally got my information updated with the credit bureaus and just this week was able to buy a new car... which was delivered to my house this morning!!!\n\nMy boyfriend and I are still together and have been long distance since the move in September. It hasnt been easy but we both care about each other so much and despite the challenges has been going really well.\n\nNew boyfriend. New house. New job. New car.\n\nI have my kids, I have my health and I am starting to slide into euphoria. Being a woman has come so natural to me, it is so clear to me that this was the right choice. Transitioning has been hands down the hardest thing I have ever done in my life (and I say that as a former Marine who deployed to a combat zone). But now that I am getting through the bullshit and the clouds are starting to part it is overwhelmingly evident how right it was. I am also so thankful, as a former Planned Parenthood patient, to be able to use my professional skillset to give back to the very community that helped me through the darkest time of my life.\n\nI know many of you are just starting out and it is overwhelming and maybe you feel like this is the end and it wont get better. It WILL get better. I promise. And if you are ever in a position where you think it wont, just know that we are all sisters and this entire community has your back and wants to see you do well. When we stand in solidarity with each other we are never truly alone.\n\nDont let toxic people bring you down. We have to fight way harder than most for just the simplest of things. Each and every one of us is a fighter to the core. I commend all of you who recognize the ability to make change to promote happiness versus giving into the darkness. Every single one of you is an inspiration to me.\n\nThank you for coming to my TedTalk.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I appreciate everyone's feedback. I am sorry that I upset some of you by coming across as privileged. You may think that and that is your right. Just know that there is a lot more to this story than what is posted here and I am not where I am because things were handed to me... I am where I am because I had to fight for it. You read my post and say I am privileged because I have parents who can help me. What you didnt read (because I didnt include it) is that I have lost so much more. I didnt want to focus on the pain and my post is a high level overview of my situation. This isnt a competition. This is MY story. The premise of the post is that time heals all wounds.

This has been made worse by the pandemic and my lack of good seating areas to work on my laptop and I am yet to go to physical therapy. I am doing this through my insurance and the way they calculate how much to take out is based on a ratio of height and body weight. I am 5'2\", and this method means if there was someone who was 6'0\" with the same ratio she would have the same amount of tissue removed as me. I am on the smaller side, and the 300-500grams (I can get 300g out instead if I lose a little weight) would put me down to a B, it is a very significant percentage of my breast.

She was having a hard time understanding the work and was getting really upset and kept talking over me. My mom heard the commotion and came into the room with a switch (long twig from a tree). She then proceeded to hit my niece and yell at her, making her shut down and cry.\n\nMy niece has had a very hard childhood so her behavior has been horrible. My family likes to use physical dicipline and yelling to get the kids in order, but of course it doesn't work with everyone, especially not my niece. I'm guilty of falling in the same routine of yelling and hitting my niece thinking it would work on her and I hate myself for it. It's severely traumatizing her so I've been trying to change myself and come at my niece with new, more gentle approaches of discipline, but my mom still uses her old ways on her making the situation worse.\n\nI got angry and started trying to explain that what my mom is doing is not helping. She then trys to yell at my niece but i'm yelling over her. She turns to me and proceeds to tell me that because I'm 19 that I don't talk back to her when she's trying to talk to my niece. I then  took the two switches out of her room and she locked me out of the house. \n\n5 minutes later, my niece opened the door. I grabbed my phone, wallet, and keys and jumped in my car.\n\nWhat should I do from this point on? I have no other place to go, I don't get paid until Friday.

However, I have heard of a few student teacher friendships and even relationships working out, of course after the student has graduated and is of legal age.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI transferred into this new school about 7 months ago, the start of my senior year. I am 18, I just graduated 2 months ago from HS (Yes. A bit early. I go to a crazy tiny school and so they basically said \"you have all your credits you need. You can graduate early.\" So I did.)\n\nMy whole life I have been told that I am 'mature for my age'. Not just from creepy strangers, but from regular people. For example, I go to a dog park with my dog and every time I go there are two girls there and recently they invited me to drinks. I was like \"I am not yet of legal drinking age\" and they were like \"Oh my god I am so sorry I thought you were 23-25.\" This has happened to me multiple times on many different occasions. I think this is because I have a high IQ and EQ. (Both in the upper 120s and lower 130s.)\n\nThe teacher (I will call him Y) in question is in his early 20's. I identify as 'sapiosexual' which essentially means that I am far more attracted to intelligence than any sort of physicality. That being said, I am very attracted to Y, beyond 'just friends'.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI have always made closer friends with my teachers then I have with my peers. I go to a very small private school in NY. I think my graduating class is like 15 people. Many days I would sit with Teacher X (very different than Y, I think of X almost like a dad) during lunch. Eventually, I ended up just sitting in the teachers lounge. I can tell it wasn't a pity thing, we would all talk about philosophy, books we were reading, annoying students. When a new teacher transferred in, he thought I was one of the other teachers.\n\nWhen I graduated, I promised my teachers I would write them (at the very least) monthly updates. Most of them reply with 2-9 sentences.\n\nY often responds with at least 3 paragraphs. I have always been happy to get his emails but have never been outwardly flirtatious. I am not the kind of girl to wear short skirts, or even crop tops. I am not outwardly sexual. \n\nMore recently he said some things that made it seem like he may be flirting?\n\n\\- He emailed me on his personal account instead and said that it was \"just in case he ended up moving\". I didn't know moving was ever in his plans and I don't think that is something you decide overnight. I feel like it would have been logical if he said \"and I am moving\". Maybe I am overthinking but it seems like he just wanted to email me on his personal email and he had to think an excuse.\n\n\\- He very clearly stated he was single...in a round-the-bout way. He said \"I am glad that quarantine may be coming to an end, it has been lonely, just me and my dog\"\n\n\\-Finally, he invited me out to get coffee. I know that coffee is typically seen as just a friendly thing but all of those in combination seemed like a flirty move, but I don't know, you tell me.\n\nWhat should I do in this situation? I feel comfortable with Y, but I feel like a bad person for even having these thoughts.

I started my journey last Sunday, made it to Wednesday, PMO'd 4 times that day and once the next morning before gearing myself back up and trying again - on day 2 now.\n\nI don't know why I'm posting this, I thought I could just lurk and get information from the group that would help me, but I keep seeing this great fruit from those that choose to invest in the community, so I really want to be apart of this. I've never thought so deeply about addiction to P and M in my life. The deeper I look, the more I feel out what's going on inside, the more I start to see how much of my life it has actually damaged. I now know what it feels like to use P to make me feel better, I'VE FUCKING IDENTIFIED THAT FEELING! Wow man, I didn't even know that existed before. And now that I've realised that, I'm starting to question how much of my life (my problems, my wins, big news, small news, everything) I have run from, and towards porn or sex because of. Fuck me man, you don't wanna know the answer.\n\nFor those that aren't spiritual, this one might not ring as true. But as a spiritual man, I thought I was at the depths of what I had discovered in myself, and the work through shadow that I had gone through to be where I am. Like I feel fucking powerful brothers, my confidence peaking, physical fitness. Essentially, all the benefits you get from NoFap, I was getting a lot of that through spirituality. But for some reason, SOME REASON, I still couldn't admit to myself that P and M were a problem for me. I had everything, but was still missing so much because it was hidden behind this addiction that I didn't know was an addiction. We're talking to the point now that I don't even know if my loving relationships are loving, or just based on sex. And I need to dive into myself to figure that one out. I've given myself the 90 day challenge, I'm taking it up. In 90 days time I plan to see how I feel about certain things in my life, see how deep this addiction has actually sunken it's teeth into me.\n\nI would laugh it off, thinking I've gone 10 days at a time before (away camping or something), this will be easy. Man, fuck me this week has been hard. It's like such apart of who you are and you're daily routine, such a habit to go to when things are a bit sucky, or even if you're about to go out somewhere. Insanely mad props to those that have gone before and conquered, leading the way for those of us coming up, and those of us still to come.\n\nI know this is a lot of text, and I thank you for taking the time to read it. \n\nMy name is Geoff (name may have been changed for personal reasons :P), I'm 32 years old, have been masturbating since I was 9, and I'm addicted to P and M. It's a pleasure to meet you, and I hope to grow along side some amazing brothers and sisters.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"NoFap","subreddit_id":"t5_2skrn","subreddit_subscribers":827854,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My eyes have opened and my world is growing, thank you!","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/NoFap\/comments\/n27uvy\/my_eyes_have_opened_and_my_world_is_growing_thank\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I hope you are all having a nice day, but let's roleplay together and make our day even better.\n\n*I have this idea where I'm a hot girl (or the hottest, if you prefer that) and guys are eager to fuck me. Maybe it's because I turn down most of the guys in college. I have said yes to a few guys and girls, went out on dates, but nothing much went past the first base. It also doesn't help that I wear more revealing outfits to college every day. I'm always aware of the guys drooling for me and I have a fantasy where a bunch of ugly guys have their way with me. It's so good to see the desperation in their eyes, knowing that they have little chances of fucking me hard and raw.*\n\n*This brings me to my prompt. I always get invites to various parties but I seldom attend one. I'm a busy girl who has to manage her studies and sex life. I have been seeing this guy who can only dream of being with me. But I thought he was a nice guy and gave him a shot. I wanted to take my time with him before we have sex, but that bastard couldn't wait. I went to see him, only to see his dick getting sucked by girls who hate me.*\n\n*This breaks my heart and I had to leave that place, so I ran to my dorm. Disgusted and disappointed, I opened my Instagram to distract myself. I see a lot of post and statuses of girls and guys at this huge frat party and a lot of DMs of guys asking me to join them. I really have to distract myself, no matter what. So, I went through my wardrobe and picked out a slutty outfit that will make the boys drop their jaws. I know frat guys are assholes, but I don't mind. I'm lowering my standards for one night, and if the right guy or guys can use the right words and techniques, they can sure get under my skirt. This will be their best chance to ravage my pussy and devour me.*\n\nSo, this is my fun little prompt. A cute idea I thought might work out. Let me know what you think and throw some ideas in if you feel fancy. People who can come up with darker ideas gets top priority but I can settle for tamer ideas if you present them properly. I prefer this prompt to get a bit dark, so open up to me with your filthiest ideas.\n\nAbout me. I'm 5'4, dirty blonde hair up to my shoulder, relaxed C cup (sometimes B) that I'm proud to flaunt, light tan skin and a toned body and ass that I worked hard at the gym to get. I'm 24 and work as an assistant to the chief editor for a girls magazine. While I'm new to dirty roleplay, I'm quite experienced in writing in general. I used to write a lot of short stories, both first and third-person that expanded my skills in writing.\n\nI can't really say my kinks since I'm in my exploration phase, so I'm open to a lot of kinks. I do have a few limits, like scat, gore, vore, snuff and animals. I'm open to talking about everything else.\n\nOrange envelopes only, please.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_subscribers":358685,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[F4M] The hottest girl on campus gets invited to a frat party.

! A little backstory about me and my family. I'm 23 year old, male and come form a slavic county. I'm unnaturally tall and skinny, kind of like slenderman\n\nMy family consist of my dad, my mom, my sister and my brother. My brother doesn't even give a fuck about me and my sister is supportive. However my parents are extremely homophobic and even slightly racist.\n\nAlright, so even from a young age i have always known im am sexually attracted to both females and males, but i never got to explore the latter attraction due to obvious complications\n\nI come from a poor slavic county where the concept of LGBTQ+ is kind of new and not very well received. I lived there for 18 years, until i graduated 12th grade and got the chance to go to study abroad, which i gladly took !\n\nFirst i was off to Germany where I found a gal, but it was nothing serious and thus i moved on, going to Spain for a 2 years working my ass off to even survive, however I did not like it there and moved to England where I currently reside, working as much as I can to stay afloat.\n\nThrough my journey i have met a lot of people, but none as interesting as...uhhh...Miami and Josh (those are not their names, this is all for privacy reasons). Those two were best friends with Miami being a native and Josh being a foreigner like me. I met the two at my workplace and soon discovered that Miami and i were going to the same college. From there the three of us became best friends, they were quick to let me in their group and began doing things with me all the time\n\nAnd spending so much time together i learned a few things about them. Where they were from, their lives, their goals and aspirations all the good things, and the more time we spent together the more I realized Josh and I are the perfect mach for eachother, with Miami always pushing us to be together\n\nOne day we caved in and decided to give it a shot saying \"It's just something temporary\"....well it has lasted 2 years now and it's still going. But there was always a lingering problem in the back of my mind...my family.\n\nAnd as the stars aligned they decided to come over from the holidays and visit me. Worst part is i had told them \"i had a partner\" before because they were awfully pushy, but i always kept it vague so they wouldn't figure it out\n\nBoth Miami and Josh knew about my parents homophobic and racist tendencies and realized that telling them i like Josh (who is a black man so whoohoo double _\"im-fucked\"_ bingo) was not going to work. Together we came up with a plan....\n\nIt was simple, Miami would pretend to be my girlfriend for the holidays while Josh and I don't show any feelings towards eachother. The plan was good...ON PAPER !\n\nThe moment my family stepped out if the plane and i greeted them things went sour as i was holding Josh's hand. Then during dinner i was constantly talking to him and giving him attention. And to Miami's credit she did try to smear and cover things up, with my sister catching up sooner than expected and helping me too\n\nBut then it happened. The plates were empty and all that was left was dessert. Josh, being the nice \"friend\" he is decided to go get the desserts and bring them over...oh, how i wish I was the one that brought that cursed chocolate cake over. That was because when Josh got up to get the cake he tripped over and fell on his face, everyone laughed but i was horrified and rushed over to check on him. I picked him up, checking if he was hurt and dusted him off, all the while gazing in his eyes. And then emotions took over him and he kissed me saying \"I'm alright, don't worry about me\"\n\n_\"Fuck....me...\"_ i though as the entire family put two and two together. I HAVE NOT SEEN A CROWD THIS MAD EVER ! It was a bloodbath of yells and cries. My father jumped up and tried to beat my boyfriend for kissing me, my mother cried in shame and my brother...well he was fueling the fames by whispering \"How could you...\" \n\nIt took my sister, me, Miami and Josh 2 hours to PHYSICALLY push my family out if the house, all the while they were telling about what a disgrace i was and how they disowned me. Upon kicking them out and waiting out for them to stop kicking my door screaming, i collapsed and cried myself to sleep.\n\n It's been 2 days since the incident. Josh can not stop apologizing, though it was not his fault, my sister is trying her best to calm me down and Miami we'll she is helping bother me and my bf get through this. As of today i have officially been exhaled from the family. Which told me to never set foot in their house, MY house \n\n(I apologize for my bad english at times, it's not my native language and also sorry for the stupid names like Miami and Josh but i want their identities to remain confidential)\n\nTL,DR: I was supposed to act non gay for the holidays infront of my family but failed and now I can not return home ever again","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello !

I plan on losing weight in the summer because I work a lot and do not keep up with lifting\/eating. In the fall when I go back to school, I am thinking about experimenting with ostarine. My local supplement store sells ostarine and I have had multiple friends cycle on and make gains. I am aware that there are plenty of scams and SARMS that are not lab tested, but I am certain that these are tested and the company is trustworthy. I would say that I am fairly cut with visible abs and veins on my forearms, chest, traps, calves, you get the point. But when I go to school in the fall I want to be disciplined in 4500cal a day with strict push\/pull\/legs lifts. My goal is to look exactly as I do now (body composition wise) and weigh in at about 170lbs. I am still gaining weight slowly and my numbers are improving slightly, but with this supplement I feel like reaching this goal is easily attainable. I do not even care about how much I lift (it\u2019s so sad how far behind my chest is lagging in comparison to my back\/legs). I am WELL AWARE of the side effects so please do not just say \u201cbad for you; just take tren;YoU cAn\u2019T sAy YoUr NaTtY;\u201d bullshit because I know this. The thing I enjoy most in life is working out in order to look better and I feel as if this supplement would help me achieve my goals.Now I plan on doing a 90ish day cycle (still reading and researching hence the reddit post) while following a strict diet and not drinking alcohol at all during this time. I will also take a small break from preworkout so that I am fresh going into this. I will not be taking pre for the time being as I\u2019d like to keep physical strain to a minimum (somewhat). Another statement is that I smoke weed as well and I am wondering if anyone else has taken SARMS and also smoked. I do not want to take steroids by any means (fuck needles) but I am aware using this will consider me not natural but, who gives a shit. Swole is the goal size is the prize I want to be scary looking in my mid 20s. Thoughts? Comments? Any personal experiences? Please share and thanks a lot.TL;DR: Will taking a short cycle of ostarine on a strict diet make gains that are noticeable to me?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"sarmsinformation","subreddit_id":"t5_hxxkp","subreddit_subscribers":1682,"subreddit_type":"restricted","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"SARMS (21+ responses only please)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/sarmsinformation\/comments\/n284zj\/sarms_21_responses_only_please\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

Every time I have sex, there is such an urge to not pull out. To instead press against your cervix. To fill your womb with virile seed instead. Once we finish the act, it's not over. There are two occasions where a woman is most attractive:\n\nWhen my cum is dripping out of your pussy, down your legs. You feel my warm cum slowly leaking from your stretched, sore pussy. Your fertile womb filled with my virile seed, slowly leaking throughout the day. You know that you've been impregnated. If not, we'll try again and again.\n\nWhen my cum leads to a baby bump, your feminine form swelling with my baby inside you. Your body is becoming more sensitive; your breasts engorged. You feel the baby occasionally. It drives you wild. At this point, I won't be able to keep my hands off of you. There's something magical about a heavily pregnant woman. I can just imagine bending you over a counter. Your pregnant belly weighing on you, your pussy dripping wet due to pregnancy hormones. I'll make sure you never leave home without a creampie ;)\n\nI know that I'm more virile than most. I regularly donate sperm and this has led to 40+ pregnancies already. Even one time that I don't pull out will probably lead to pregnancy.

I've been thinking about marriage a lot more than usual recently and would like to share my thoughts and mainly my concerns about why I want to get married in the first place.\n\nI'm a 21 year old male who has never been in a relationship before, never committed zina and barely speak to any girls these days at all. I've liked 1 or 2 girls before in my life but thats about it. As is the problem with many single males in this day and age, I have struggled with PMO for a long time, I'd say since the age of around 14. Thats 7 years of a constant struggle against my desires and who knows for how many more years I will continue to be in the same cycle for. I hope not many. Make duaa for me.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm a PMO addict. I've read stories from these types of people who watch P several times a day and claim they can't go more than a day without getting their dose. I'm not the same as this. I have some level of self-control, albeit it does fluctuate from time to time. I'd say the average over this entire 7 year period is that I probably commit 'said sin' about 1-2 times a week, with many periods where I have gone on streaks (my longest streak has been roughly only 3 months long).\n\nThese desires are something that Allah has instilled in each and every one of us and are natural. I used to tell myself (when I was 16-18) that if I was living a hundred years ago, I would probably have been married by now and that the difficulty of getting married young in today's society is my excuse why I'm having to do this sin so much.\n\nI would also blame the western culture that I am immersed in for exposing me to my desires at such a young age and providing me with the wrong form of an outlet to act upon them. I used to tell myself to just be patient, keep struggling against your nafs, soon you will be married and this will all be behind you.\n\nNow that I'm 21 and at the lower limit of what people would call a 'young marriage' these days, I am thinking to begin seriously \"searching\" for a spouse. However I am realising that the only reason driving me to get married right now is the huge s\\*xual frustration I have been holding in for all these years. I am realising that I basically just want to get married to avoid zina. \n\nBut is this really the correct motivation\/intention for marriage? What about all the other beautiful things that come with marriage like completing your deen, praying together, giving charity together, going to hajj together etc etc? I don't seem to think about these that much at all, they are just secondary motivations - my primary motivation is just so that I can have an outlet for my desires that is not sinful. Is this the correct motivation for mariage?\n\nI'm not sure if I'm being naive but I wouldn't want someone like that to marry my sister. This just makes me put off searching for a spouse at all which then makes me depressed coz I realise this means I will be in the same cycle I have been in for 7 years for even longer, maybe forever. \n\nIt also puts me off the idea of having children if I ever did get married because they will just suffer through the same stuff I suffered with. If society continues the way its going, it will only be even harder for them, and it's not like there will be much I can do to help them with it. \n\nI didn't mean to be dull but I have just been questioning whether I want to get married for the correct reasons. Is getting married with the main motivation being to avoid zina a legitimate motivation? How would my spouse feel if she knew this piece of information? What should I do to ensure I am looking for a spouse with the correct intention, when I am struggling against my desires so much?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MuslimMarriage","subreddit_id":"t5_39x1d","subreddit_subscribers":19482,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My motivation for getting married.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.94,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MuslimMarriage\/comments\/n2899j\/my_motivation_for_getting_married\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}
