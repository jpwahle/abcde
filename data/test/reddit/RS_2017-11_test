I'm 26 now and ever since I graduated college it seems to come more often. Maybe it hasn't, but with my career, it is hard to meet people. I have my bros which all live across the US and I talk to them daily, but I feel empty.\n\nI've tried to fill that emptiness with my career and have had some good success that way. But there are times, like right now, where everything slows down and I realize I'm alone. I have dated a few girls but they never work out. Either I get ghosted (happened once) or I lose interest completely. In college, I fell in love for the first time with this girl, lets call her Sally. She and I got along so well but we each had personal issues that destroyed our relationship. It was definitely a mess but we got along so well that we eventually started talking again after college, just as friends. She met someone and they've been dating for a few years. Ive met him and he's cool and theres no hard feelings at all. But I still think she was great for me and that if I met her after college after we matured we would be married or engaged. I honestly think it was bad timing. \n\nBut that is not healthy for me to think about and I usually ignore that feeling. However every time I meet someone and go on a few dates it always comes back to Sally. Think to myself \"Why is this girl so boring?\", \"Why do I feel like meeting with her is a chore\", \"When I was with Sally I was so excited I could feel my heart racing when she was near\"\n\nI consider myself attractive, smart, and ambitious but I am completely lost in the dating world. I'm a bit introverted so doing the whole routine is a pain sometimes. There are girls that I immediately felt the same way as I did with Sally but found out they have bfs (I will even admit that I have gotten several of them to cheat with me). I don't know what to do. I need an anchor, I need someone to push myself to be the best version of myself I can be and vice versa, I want a true partner. I haven't found the right mix of beauty and brain for me. Seems like I either like their personality but don't necessarily find them that attractive or the opposite where I can't stand them.\n\nI know I sound like a narcissist but this is me venting.

This is the third time in about 3 years I've gone one week without drinking. Every other time I've only made it a day or two before I started again. The last time I went one week was when I went camping by myself over the summer and specifically didn't bring any booze. I literally had to go out into the forest so I wouldn't be tempted to drink/have access to alcohol. As soon as I got back to civilization I went to the bar and had a beer. The time before that was back in May. I committed to one week of sobriety, and then as soon as that week was up, I was in the bar, \"rewarding\" myself for a job well done. \n\nI've woken up with countless hangovers and every time it's always, \"This is the last time I'm drinking.\" I would feel like shit in the morning, but by the time 5 pm came along I would have forgotten my regrets and either felt good enough to start drinking again, or I would still feel like shit and drink to catch another buzz to feel better. \n\nI've been a blackout drinker since I started drinking at 16. I got a DUI at 19; my BAC was 0.252. I'm really lucky I didn't kill myself or anyone else. I had court-mandated drug and alcohol treatment and spent a weekend in jail. Before that, I had an arrest for underage drinking. I sobered up while in treatment, but started drinking again when I went away to college at 20, and it hasn't stopped since. I'm 38. \n\nThe last 3 years have been especially bad, with pretty much daily drinking and blackouts or brownouts 1-3 times a week. I've been working from home for about a year, and that has exacerbated my drinking because I stopped having to worry about being presentable for work or not smelling like booze. Plus, that gave me an excuse to go out and \"socialize\" as soon as I was done for the day. I justified it by saying I was home alone all day, and that I wanted to be around people. But what I really did was go to the bar, choose the tastiest, highest-ABV beers, go to the smoking patio, and usually sat alone catching a buzz. I would down 4-6 craft beers until I was drunk, then usually stop by another bar on the way home to end the night with a couple vodka sodas. By this time, I would often blackout or brownout on the walk home, barely make it into bed, and do it all over again the next day. If I didn't go to the bar, I would buy a 6-pack (or more) at 7-11 and just drink alone. At one point I was drinking 2 bottles of cheap white wine a night, because I wanted to cut back on calories. \n\nThe Sunday before last, I had planned on having one drink with a friend, and after we parted ways, I could not stop thinking about my next drink. I wanted to go grocery shopping and get stuff done for the upcoming week, but as soon as I got back to my neighborhood I bee-lined it for the bar and proceeded to get wasted. The next day, after finishing off a 6-pack to cure my hangover from Sunday, I decided that enough is enough. \n\nSo many of my life choices, from where I chose to live, to who I chose to date, have been guided by alcohol. I don't even want to think about how many tens of thousands of dollars I've spent on booze and how that money could be have been better spent on literally anything else. I don't want alcohol to rule my life anymore. I know if I have one drink, it will lead to many more, and I'm committed to not going down that path again. \n\nIt really does feel different this time around, and I have SD to thank for that. I started lurking here a couple weeks ago, and I knew that when I was ready to quit I would have a community to support me. It's been incredibly helpful reading so many stories similar to mine and knowing that there is a community of people here committed to sobriety. \n\nThank you all for being here. I will not drink with you today.

I'm 23 years old and have a 401k through my employer which I am currently putting in 6% since they match 50% up to 6%. All of this money is in a target date fund (FNSDX) and I noticed that there are a lot of other options available for me to pick. The most shocking part to me was that there are a few Vanguard funds available for me to invest in:\nVANG EQUITY INC ADM (VEIRX)\nVANG SM CAP IDX ADM (VSMAX)\nVANG TOT INTL STK IS (VTSNX)\nWould there be any benefit to me switching my money over to one of these investment options since the options are from Vanguard and not Fidelity? All of these funds have a much lower expense ratio than my current fund so I'm not sure if that's something I should think about long term. I do also see some fidelity options that are not target date funds as well so I'm wondering if those would be better options for me: \nFID TOT MKT IDX INS (FSKTX)\nFID CONTRAFUND K (FCNKX)\n\n\nAs far as a Roth IRA, I do not have one as of yet however I wanted to understand the information more on how these different company funds work before opening another account somewhere.

Or will I be better off opening an account with Vanguard or Schwab and funding the roth IRA account that way. \n\nFinally, are there any specific investment accounts that I should stay away from (bond investment, small cap stock, large cap stock, etc.) and is it good to not have two of the same type of account? i.e. having both my 401k and future roth IRA in large cap investment accounts.\n\nTL;DR - Maxed company match in 401k in my Fidelity account. Should I switch to a Vanguard fund in my Fidelity account? When I open a roth IRA (before the end of the year), should that also be through Fidelity and can I invest into other company funds there too or just open a separate account with Vanguard or Schwab for my roth IRA?\n\nThank you so much in advance for any feedback that'll help me decide what is best!

It began by saying, \u201cThis is something very personal I want to share with my FB friends.\u201d\n\nHaving no idea what I was about to see, I was curious and continued to read.\n\n\u201cSome of you know me in IRL [in real life] and some of you just from the internet. But I want you all to know a story about myself.\n\n\u201cI am a 23-year-old Kurdish girl born and raised in Finland. My parents are conservative Kurds from Bashur [Iraqi Kurdistan]. My mother\u2019s from Hewler [Arbil] and my father\u2019s from Kirkuk.\n\n\u201cExactly about 4 years ago, I decided I couldn\u2019t stand my parents anymore. My parents are Muslim conservatives and they have a tribal mind. I finished high school and after that they wanted to marry me off. I refused a few times until they got violent, so I decided to flee home. I have not had any contacts with my parents for the last 4 years. My entire family threatens me with death messages and if they see me, they will surely kill me or get violent.\n\n\u201cToday I am 23. I finished my dream university and have a great job and I live alone. My parents can contact me when they feel I am more important than their cultural tribal values and religion.\u201d\n\nDeeply moved by her testimony, I decided to learn more about her. She said that her family\u2019s physical and psychological abuse against her was so intense and unbearable that she had to leave home. The reason of their pressures was that they feared her \u201cintegration into Finnish society.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth my parents are very religious Muslims. They were afraid that after I completed high school, I would move out and live a free life like a Finnish woman. They were afraid that I would fall in love with some Finnish guy and be with him. So they got violent. But I never thought about these things. I was thinking about how to get a good education and find a good job.\n\n\u201cI was exposed to a lot of violence and ugly epithets. They said they would kill me because I didn\u2019t want to marry.  It was so hard for me to go through all of that, but I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was so depressed and felt worthless. Many times, I thought of suicide.\u201d\n\nKarissa finally decided to stay alive and live a decent life, yet the continuing threats from her family have forced her into hiding.\n\n\u201cMy family does not know where I live now. If they did, they could send my cousins to kill me or my father himself could kill me. Even the thought that they want to kill me makes me so sad and cry. My workplace is very near to my house, so I do not have to travel a lot.\u201d\n\nKarissa\u2019s family emigrated from Iraq to Finland as political refugees in 1993. As a graduate of the department of information technologies of Finland\u2019s Novia University, Karissa now works as a graphic designer. \u201cI have high goals for my career. My initial dream was to graduate from university and I made it. I now aim to be a top expert in my field.\u201d\n\nDespite all the pain she has gone through, Karissa says she still wishes to seek a reconciliation with her family.\n\n\u201cI miss my family a lot. I have no family member that I have contact with as they have all disowned me. And they have threatened me with death. They kept saying I am dirty.\n\n\u201cHow I wish they understood me and we could be a real family. But I have stopped calling them; for now, there is no hope.\u201d\n\nKarissa is also an ex-Muslim \u2013 something she has avoided telling her family.\n\n\u201cMy family does not know that I don\u2019t believe in Islam. If they did, they would hate me even more.\u201d\n\nComing out as an abused ex-Muslim woman is extremely brave yet dangerous for Karissa but she says that she has shared her story on social media to give hope and courage to other women in a similar situation:\n\n\u201cI know many women from the Middle East feel the same way and have the same fate as me. But many don\u2019t have the courage to speak out. I had two female relatives who got shot in Kurdistan because their family members thought their daughters \u2018tainted their families\u2019 honor.\u2019 I would want girls who are afraid of fleeing their homes to take the risk and flee.  But they are so afraid of their parents and what their relatives would think of or do to them. And if you are a woman, it is incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to flee your home and survive in any majority-Muslim country.\u201d\n\nAll of these horrific abuses against girls and women are taking place in Muslim communities while many self-described feminist activists in the West are busy discussing whether or not women should shave their legs or dye their arm pit hair, or what they should do in the face of \u201cslut-shaming,\u201d or why they should stop using \u201cguys\u201d to address \u201cmix-gender groups\u201d or what \u201cnon-binary pronouns\u201d should be used for those who identify as neither gender, or both.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Muslim or ex-Muslim women across the world are violated or murdered by beatings, beheading, burning, shooting, and torture for daring to make their own decisions about their own lives, such as filing for divorce or rejecting their husband\u2019s offers of reconciliation. In many cases, the perpetrators are released and not punished.\n\nViolence against women is a serious problem in many parts of the world. But in majority-Muslim countries, it is systematic and broadly tolerated. Oppression of women is allowed or even encouraged in Islamic scriptures \u2013 the Koran and at the hadith sunnah literature. (For those who are interested, all of these scriptures are easily found on the internet.)  And it is no secret that Muslim-majority countries are the worst violators of gender equality.\n\nAccording to U.S. News &amp; World Report:\n\n\u201cOf the 10 countries perceived to be the worst in terms of gender equality \u2212 based on data from the 2016 Best Countries rankings that evaluated 60 countries \u2212 eight are Muslim-majority nations. Islamic Sharia law often plays a large role in the governance of personal matters like marriage, divorce and inheritance among Muslim populations.\u201d\n\nThe murder and oppression of women in Turkey, my country of birth, is also skyrocketing as the country further Islamicizes under its Islamist government. But of course, Muslim communities are not only about that. There are also remarkably courageous women\u2019s rights activists in many Muslim countries trying to struggle against the dominant misogynistic culture they live in.\n\nFor example, a women\u2019s rights activist organization in Turkey, Kad\u0131n Cinayetlerini Durduraca\u011f\u0131z Platformu (We Will Stop Femicides Platform), issues monthly reports about the girls and women who are murdered or abused, mostly by those closest to them, such as husbands, fathers, brothers, boyfriends, sons, or grandsons. It is mind-blogging that their efforts are largely ignored by feminist academics and activists in the West.\n\nKarissa\u2019s life story is also the reason why \u2212 despite all of its flaws \u2212 Western civilization is worth defending and fighting for. On the one side, Karissa\u2019s own parents who threaten her with death for wanting to make her own choices. On the other side, there\u2019s Finland, a free and civilized country that provides Karissa with human rights and freedoms, helping her preserve her dignity, regardless of her ethnic origin or religion.\n\nEurope is far from perfect, but it\u2019s still much more culturally, morally and intellectually superior to the Islamic world. And this is what so many Westerners seem to fail to grasp.\n\nFurthermore, the move by some Western feminists to paint Islam as a pioneering force in women\u2019s rights is actually enabling the repression and murder of more Muslim women. Western feminists have a choice: They can either side with Islamists who oppress and even murder women, or they can honestly recognize the religious motivations behind those crimes and show solidarity with women violated by Muslim men. Sadly, many so-called activists seem to have chosen the former, showing how misguided they are in their thinking. Despite all of their claims, they have chosen to be ultimately uncaring and insensitive regarding women\u2019s rights in order to protect a primitive religion.\n\nUzay Bulut is a journalist and political analyst from Turkey.

Although it was way to late in getting help, I am fine now and I don't pity myself for that. I got to move on.\n\nWhat I am thinking about is the future. At this point, I know I still want to go into academia. I am 24 years old. I am on Chemistry BS track with 3.0 GPA, and my record is very spotty with multiple retakes and Ws. Even if I graduate now, I won't able to get a good job anyway and my parents agreed to invest in me for few years more.\n\nSo, I am interested in Physical Chemistry and I have been in contact with the professor I want to research in. I have been doing very badly in his class (Statistical Mechanics), but I am trying to catch up and hopefully I know enough knowledge to start research by spring semester. Since his work have been very mathematical, I am planning to invest in a lot of advanced math classes (my current level is only Calc I~III and linear algebra), and may be take few classes in physics (wave and mechanics), although I am not sure. I also plan to take one advanced chemistry class per semester to fulfill my BS requirement.\n\nMy worries are my professor would be disappointed at my bad grades and won't give me serious attention when I try to do research under him. I am willing to change labs and look for similar work, but it would be a bummer. Second is whether this is good idea or not. I will take mix of math and chemistry classes for 2 and 3 years and would my efforts be worth it?\n\nBefore continuing on, yes I know there is hard road ahead of me and I read the sidebar posts. I just want to know whether it is possible or am I doing something foolish.\n\nI know I made mistakes in the past. No matter. I just want to live again through any means and efforts.\n\nAnd, before you ask, yes, I know I want to do research for a living.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"gradadmissions","subreddit_id":"t5_2tn62","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Lost 4 years of my academic life in severe depression.

(although, it was utilites included so that was cool)\n\nI met a nice young woman at the office, about my age who said I could move in with her in December if I was looking for places to live. I think she lives in the town work is in, and she mentioned it would be like $550 a month, or something close. Another lady I worked with tried to introduce me to some people I went to college with, but they're all married and I'm guessing that's a no-go. \n\nShould I just wait it out? I mean honestly, worst case scenario I have a month of money in my pocket, hopefully that's enough to move in, I'm not sure. I feel like one of my coworkers might come in clutch, plus I can't find anything worth shit. I would also appreciate advice on places to look, if you have any. Craigslist has been less than fruitful. \n\n~Thanks in advance~","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjdm","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Should I keep looking for apartments, or should I wait it out?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7a0ks4/should_i_keep_looking_for_apartments_or_should_i/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

All these challenges have come my way but, instead of relapsing I've actually gone on my longest ever streak. When I come back to my apartment feeling like shit, I think about ways to solve my problems rather then jus drowning then out through pmo. One thing I realized is that patience is key.

have a few options for scenes that we can both enjoy. Although, they will all revolve around a mature woman who ends up being controlled or dominated by a younger male. This means that age-play could be an option. In these scenes I would like you to either be submissive and quiet from the get go or stubborn and fighting the new situation but eventually caving to your baser desires. I enjoy the build up as much as the actual fucking so please keep that in mine.\n\nAs these scenes progress I will totally control and dominate you. Whatever I want from you I just take. You will either become my sex slave and love every second of it... you'll love your place at my feet and be willing to do whatever it takes to remain there. Or you'll grow to resent me and almost hate me but you won't be able to stop me or your primal instincts to fuck the most alpha male around.\n\nWe can talk about kinks, turn ons, and turn offs in private as we get to know each other a little before the scene but here are some of my favorite kinks to give you a better idea of what I like: being dominant, non-con, impregnation/breeding (forced sometimes), public play, cucking, slavery, age play, incest, milfs, light BDSM, choking, anal, sizeplay, name calling, humiliation, bimbofication, but I'm down for almost anything. I'm not into gore or bathroom stuff though.\n\nAlso, these prompts are just to get the ideas flowing. I don't expect the scenes to play out exactly as I've written below. That would be a little boring... I like the excitement of generating something organic and reacting off each other\u2019s responses!\n\nFor a more detailed description of my kinks; check [here](https://i.imgur.com/FYytoyh.png).\n\n---\n\n * (1) Mother Doesn't Know Best\n\n---\n\nWe are your typical family. Mom, dad, and me. I play sports, you don't have to work, dad does the 9-5 thing. All of our neighbors enjoy having us around. We have a nice, two story Victorian-esque house with a small gazebo in the back yard, a white picket fence surrounding the front, and a two car garage set off to the side. There are a few trees in the front and back yard to provide shade for when we have people over. On the outside most people would kill for our family. On the inside, though, things are starting to change... For the better? Well, that would depend on who you ask. For myself? Definitely. For you? You aren't sure quite yet. For dad? He's so in the dark he thinks everything is fine. You've noticed some small changes in me. I talk to you a little differently. More... aggressively. You aren't sure how to put words to it but you certainly notice some changes in my tone as well. On top of that you've also noticed my eyes staying on you a little longer than a son's should. Sometimes, you've even seen me eyeing you up and down when I think you aren't paying attention. You've noticed some panties of your shifted around in your drawers, also. Nothing that would normally go noticed but you've always had a keener sense of what's happening around you. Now what do you do? Should you have dad talk to me about all this? Shit, you don't know. It's a delicate situation. Maybe you should handle it yourself. It does directly involve you and you feel like maybe a mother's light touch would be for the best in this situation...\n\n---\n\n * (2) The Milf Next Door\n\n---\n\nIt's summer again and you just don't have time to mow the grass. I mean, really, who has time for such a trivial thing? Not you! You're too busy trying to tease all the men in the town. You sometimes strut around in tight fitting dresses and high heels. Other times you're wearing low cut tops with short shorts. You even break out your yoga shorts and too tight sports bra when going to and from yoga class. Whatever the outfit may be, you make sure as many men in town see as possible. It isn't about the end game with you. No, it's all about the tease. You enjoy driving these men crazy with lust. Oftentimes, you wonder what they do to their wives after you've thoroughly teased them. That is usually what drives you over the edge at night as you finish yourself off from a good day\u2019s work. I live a few houses down from you in the neighborhood and it seems my mother has offered my services to you as a landscaper. It's a Saturday afternoon and I would rather be biking or playing with my friends. I trudge over to your house with a little bit of an attitude as I greet you at the door. I have some pent up aggression from this situation and it seems like you're the closest one to take it out on.\n\n---\n\n * (3) A Husband's Mistake\n\n---\n\nDid you hear that right? Did you husband just tell you that you've been sold? Is that even possible anymore? It can't be right... not in this day and age. No... no... you heard right. What the fuck? How? Why? What is going on? A million question rush through you head as this is told to you. Apparently, your always dependable husband has been betting massive amounts of money on MMA fights with... the mob!? How the hell did he even meet this kind of people!? You two have always live the typical suburbia lifestyle. Nothing fancy or outside of your means. At least that's what you thought. Now, you're being told by your husband, who is flanked on both sides by two hulking men in black suits, that you're being given to the head guys son. If you refuse they will kill both you and your husband. What kind of an option is that? One of the men tells you that your husband has had plenty of times to pay up but he never did. Now this is his last option and you're along for the ride. After being blindfolded and driven somewhere you are greeted by a blinding light. The light hitting you now is just from your eyes adjusting from being covered for so long. In front of you sits a large man also garbed in a black suit. He recaps everything your husband and the other man told you. You assume you're to be his maid or something along those lines. Work off your husband's debt. Your jaw drops when you're told by this man that you're to be his son's sex toy. He wants his son to grow up knowing what sex is and how it can be. He tells you that you're to do whatever and do anything his son asks. You try to speak but there is nothing coming... You try again but are quickly blindfolded again and taken to meet your new master...\n\n---\n\n * (4) Recent Move\n\n---\n\nI've recently moved with my family because my dad got a new job in a different state. He works a few towns over so he's out most of the day. Mom is a stay at home mom who seems to think it's still the 50's. She cooks, cleans, and does the laundry with a smile on her face. Dad makes enough for her to be able to do that. I go to the local school and do alright. My grades are pretty good and I'm on a few of the sports teams. The town is a little strange though. All the women are big breasted (DD is considered average), with (almost impossibly) slim waists, big hips, long legs, larges asses, and plump lips. Most have bleach blonde hair and are almost always accompanied by a much younger man. The young guys were also affected by whatever was changing the women. They were packed full of muscles, lean bodies, and giant... appendages... where anything less than a foot is small. What's the deal with this town? Is there something in the water? Do they put something in the food? Behind closed doors something weird is going on. Driving by a few of the houses on our way to the new house there were these young guys having their way with these bimbo-type women. The blinds weren't pulled and there was no attempt to hide it. A few of them were even enjoying each other on the front porch completely out in the open. It was insane! The town was called Cougar City and it seemed like all the women were having their fun with these younger guys. Moms with their sons, neighbors with neighbors, teachers with students, nurses with patients, you name it. But it seemed like something in the town was changing people\u2019s bodies into something made purely for sex.\n\n---\n\n * (5) The Neighborhood Bully\n\n---\n\nYour son has recently been coming home with bruises and black eyes. He hasn't been telling you what is happening but you think you have some idea. Today was an especially bad day... He came home with two black eyes and some scraps and cuts on his body. With tears streaming down his face he eventually tells you that it was me. I live a few houses down and you're pretty shocked that your son named me as the culprit. I always came off as such a nice boy but if it was true and I was the one doing this to your son you had to put a stop to it. You storm outside in a fury and are rushing down the sidewalk to my house. You see me outside on my tree swing and make a bee-line straight towards me. The smile on my face is like salt on the wound to you as a mother. You start laying into me about how awful it is that I treat your son that way, how I must be a terrible little boy, and how I better start treating your son better or else. I look at you the entire time with a blank stare on my face. After you finish your rant I pull my hand back and slap your face... hard. Enough so that a red hand print appears almost immediately. Still smiling I say you can't talk to me like that and that I'm the one I charge here. With your mouth a gap and a million thoughts running through your head I lean up and press my lips into yours. I jam my tongue down your throat, my hands grip your head and force you to hold still for just a moment before you pull yourself away. Stunned, you stumble back a little, pause, and then quickly go back home. Your mind is rushing and everything is like a blur. Suddenly it hits you, you're wet. No. Not just wet. You're soaked. Your panties are drenched and your shorts are even damp. A few days\u2019 pass and I come knocking on your door. You see it's me outside and you feel your legs weakening. You feel compelled to open the door for me...\n\n---\n\n * (6) Doctors Visit\n\n---\n\nIt\u2019s time for another yearly doctor\u2019s exam but dad\u2019s work changed medical plans. So, now our old doctor is no longer in our providers list. Mom and dad hunted long and hard to find a good doctor for the family. Eventually they settled with you. The online reviews said you were the best in town. Five star reviews from almost every person who took the time to write or review. Mom brings me into the office for my first exam and checkup. The nurse comes out and takes me into the back. She asks if mom wants to come but says she doesn\u2019t need to. A strange look crosses my mom\u2019s face but she reluctantly says that she can just wait. Probably thinking that she has to slowly let me grow up eventually, might as well start now in a safe doctor\u2019s office. Back in the exam room the nurse goes over vitals and asks me some pretty standard questions. Things seem to be pretty standard so far\u2026 until she asks me to disrobe. This was new\u2026 and weird... But I do it anyway. I strip down to nothing revealing my large package. The nurse\u2019s eyes widen a bit but she continues to be very professional. After a few moments, she says she has everything she needs and that the doctor will be in soon. Time passes and I wonder if the doctor is ever coming in to see me. Sitting there naked with my large cock dangling between my legs as it rests on my immense balls the door finally opens. You walk in and stop almost dead in your tracks as your eyes lock onto my member\u2026\n\n---\n\n * (7) Older Brother\u2019s Wife\n\n---\n\nThe funeral was a month ago last Sunday. Mom and dad both passed away in a car accident on their way to see me in my first jiu jitsu tournament. They were older to begin with but still had plenty of time left. Honestly, they were too old when they had me. Your husband, my brother, tried to talk some sense into them when they first time him about being pregnant with me. Well, now mom and dad are gone and I\u2019ve come to live with you and my brother. There\u2019s an almost 30-year age gape between him and I. You\u2019re very caring and nurturing, so, for you to see me sad constantly because of what happened you\u2019ve been doing anything you can to cheer me up. You\u2019ve been encouraging me to get back into jiu jitsu classes. To train again. Finally, I went back and you did notice an improvement, as little as it was, it was still an improvement in my mood. After a particularly hard training session I go straight into the shower after you bring me home without saying a word. This worries you a little and so you want to check on me to make sure everything is ok. Opening the door without knocking was the first mistake. Wanting what you saw sitting there on the toilet stroking was the second mistake.\n\n---\n\n * (8) Submoxifilin\n\n---\n\nThere\u2019s a new street drug: Submoxifilin. It\u2019s been all over the news, papers, Facebook, Twitter, podcasts, radio talk shows, everywhere. It\u2019s becoming an epidemic. The police don\u2019t know how to battle it because once it hits a liquid it dissolves almost immediately and doesn\u2019t show up in any kind of testing. It\u2019s untraceable, looks like a regular aspirin, and the person that takes it thinks the choices they make while on it are their own choices. It\u2019s the perfect drug. What does it do, you might be asking yourself? Well, it makes the user completely open to suggestions. It doesn\u2019t matter what those suggestions might be\u2026 they will do it without question or hesitation. Some have been using it for terrorism, some to get rich, some to rig elections. The world is being turn upside down by this new street drug. Who we are in this scene is completely free and up for debate.\n\n---\n\n * (9) A Crime Gone Wrong\n\n---\n\nYou always knew your boyfriend was a bad boy but that turned you on. He was dangerous. Danger turned you on like nothing else. So, when he would come home with drugs, and guns, and money, and, yes, even the occasional other woman you were ready and willing. The lifestyle he had wasn\u2019t for you but you weren\u2019t the one doing it. He was. He was the one going out every day breaking the law. Committing sin. Disobeying society. Those thoughts kept you up at night riding him like a bucking bronco. It was all fairly petty stuff anyway. Nothing serious that had you worrying. Selling weed, occasionally coke to the rich bankers in the city, things like that. Until today\u2026 you came home after your 9-5 and went to the basement to start some laundry before making dinner for him. You know he likes dinner to be on the plate and table by 6. Running behind schedule you rush down into the basement and don\u2019t notice the piece of paper taped to the door. **Don\u2019t go down into the basement!** As your feet touch the cool cement floor you hear it first. Muffled moans. Your head is drawn to the noise. You glance over to the corner and see me. Naked. Tied to a chair. A dark cloth covering my eyes. A gag tapped to my mouth. Your draw drops and you cover your mouth in shock, terror, confusion. So many emotions crash into you in that moment. Your eyes taking in the whole situation. He fucking kidnapped a kid!? Then you see it. No. It couldn\u2019t be that big\u2026 could it? It was soft and it was already that big!? Maybe you\u2019ve been around filth for too long but you don\u2019t run and untie me right away. He\u2019s going to be home any minute! Your mind is telling you to stop but your desires are screaming to continue. Before you know it you\u2019re naked too and stroking. Getting me hard. Climbing on top. Slowly lowering yourself onto my engorged pole\u2026 Was that the door your just heard open?!\n\n---\n\n * (10) Mom Should\u2019ve Knocked\n\n---\n\nWhen an unfamiliar car pulled into the driveway around the time I should\u2019ve been getting home from school a slight frown crossed your face. You weren\u2019t in the mood to deal with any solicitors or someone selling a religion. Then you saw a young girl get out of the driver\u2019s side. She was long, lean, and curve in all the right places. She couldn\u2019t be more than 17 you thought to yourself. Who is this girl? Then I get out of the passenger side. What the heck? She was too old to be hanging out with someone my age\u2026 You hear the backdoor open and before you can go see who this girl is the phone rings. Shit\u2026 Mike (your husband, my dad) was going to call and let you know if he was going to make his flight home or not. You decide answering the phone is more important at this particular moment. You\u2019re informed by dad that his conference was extended by a week! After a long, angry call between the two of you you hang up. After pouring yourself a glass of water and taking a few sips the girl pops back into your mind. Who was she? Your curiosity and motherly instincts kick in and you go to investigate. Without knocking or thinking you open the door to my room and what you see shocks you. She\u2019s completely naked and on all fours on my bed. I\u2019m behind her pumping away. Your eyes dart between her and I. You see her breasts swinging with each thrust of my body. Her taught, young bottom jiggles as my hips come forward and crash into her. You see that she has her face buried into a pillow to muffle her moans. Then you notice me\u2026 or\u2026 part of me. It\u2019s large and thick and veiny. Dad hasn\u2019t touched you in years it feels like and your mind wavers for just a moment. Flashes of things no mother should think of flood your mind. For a moment, you struggle with the decision to stop us or slip back out since neither of us have noticed you yet. We\u2019re too engrossed with each other to notice anything but each other\u2019s bodies.\n\n---\n\n * (11) Date Night\n\n---\n\nIt's been months since you and my dad had any time to yourselves.  You've both been working like slaves and it seems like you're both just passing ships in the night.  It was you who brought it up.  You were the one that wanted to make an effort to actually see each other again for more than a goodbye in the morning.  You were the one who suggest a date night.  A night with just the two of you.  You looked up a baby sitter for me, picked the nicest restaurant in town, even bought a new dress and heels to wear.  Dad agreed and everything was set.  Then you got the call.  As soon as you saw it was the office number your heart fell to the floor.  You didn't even bother to pick up the phone.  The voicemail that dinged on your phone moments later was pointless to listen to.  It would be hours before he got home.  After cancelling the babysitter your eyes fell upon the fresh, unopened bottle of vodka next to the fridge.  The next thing you know you're stumbling to your room, knocking a few pictures off the wall as you go.  The bed grows larger as you approach it before finally falling on it.  As you land your dress flies up exposing your pantyless ass and exposed pussy.  Moments later I appear in the doorway...\n\n---\n\n * (12) Unconditional Love\n\n---\n\nI was really too young to understand why daddy left in the first place. Mommy and daddy would yell and fight each other during the day, and mommy would cry at night. Almost every memory before daddy left is too blurry to remember. After daddy left, mommy cried every single day. Mommy began to change. She started acting differently around you. She started wearing less and less clothing. She started giving you longer good-night kisses. She started touching my penis to wake me up in the morning. I thought nothing of it until recently. I've started to develop feelings for mommy. I've started to get butterflies in my stomach every time she came home from work. Mommy treats her little boy like her new husband. She greets me with a long kiss after work, I sleeps in the same bed as mommy, and she's started talking about having another child. Part of you tells you that this is wrong. Mommy's far too old for me. But a part of me tells me that this is perfect. I love mommy. And mommy loves me.\n\n---\n\n * (13) Deception, Retaliation\n\n---\n\nAll this time you've raised me like your own son, when in reality, my real mother is far away. She couldn't care less about me really. Out of the blue, she calls the house wanting to speak to me. You tell her to go to hell. Serves her right. She is stubborn. You can see where I get the stubborn gene from. When she calls back you're just as combative and adamant to say \"no\". More like \"hell no!\". She doesn't deserve me. Finally she tracks me down at school. That bitch! After all the times you warned her to stay away, she manages to get in touch with me. She tells me her sob story, which I rightly don't believe. You hesitate, but after a few days time, you spill the beans. You tell me the truth about everything. Justifiably I'm mad at you. To win me back, you bake me my favorite cookies. She one-ups you (that bitch...) by baking better delicious brownies. Which you must admit she's the better cook. She wins another battle when she gets me a better gift than what you could afford. The battles get nastier and nastier until you find her one day, on her knees slurping down my load. You're appalled and disgusted that my own mother would do such a thing. You wouldn't blame me for being shocked when you decide to offer your ass, for me to fuck, in retaliation.\n\n---\n\n * (14) My Girlfriend is My Mom\n\n---\n\nYou've noticed I've been a lot more sad recently. I just asked my first crush to go steady, and she said no. Your poor little man, you can't bare to see me like this! If only there was something you could do to help... \"Honey... I noticed you've been real down lately. Look, there will be other girls! You're a handsome boy, and anyone would be lucky to date you. In fact, I was just thinking... and it's going to sound awfully weird... but maybe I could be your girlfriend? Just for practice! I mean, you're the man of the house since Dad left, so it makes sense... Right?\".\n\n---\n\n * (15) The Apology\n\n---\n\nYou know he may seem like a monster, he's actually really sweet. Ok truth be told, he's hopeless but you still try. What else can you do? He's your special guy and always will be. No matter how many awful things he does, you can never disown him or anything. You wish your son was a better person. You really do. In his wake of terror, you try your best to clean up and fix things. If he breaks something, you pay for it. If he says something awful, you try to apologize to smooth things over. It seems like things have gotten worse as he is fast approaching teenage years. Your special coddling has made him turn into a bully. A rather nasty one. I'm one of the many victims he picks on. One day you catch him in the act for the first time and see just how awful he is.  You try to make up for it by making me cookies, or maybe offering me free stuff. Once that doesn't seem to work, you come up with a few ideas no man can resist...\n\n---\n\n * (16) A Mother's Plight\n\n---\n\nI can't sleep so you try all sorts of ways to help me. Being my mother you're always trying to help. You find out, by accident, that a nice tender handjob does the trick. You're ashamed of yourself after it happens. But it keeps happening night after night. Even sometimes during the day it happens. I come home from school all worked up and burned out by homework, so a good orgasm is what the doctor orders to relieve tension. Eventually, handjobs just aren't enough to finish the job.  The next natural step is for me to fuck your pussy but that's too risky. Reluctantly you offer my ass instead. \"It's the only way, honey. Go on. Just be quick about it...\". Somehow I last way longer than my father, which you didn't think was possible. You're always so sore after a thorough anal pounding, but you continuously let me use you in the hopes that I'll de-stress and not have the urge to knock some other girl up. Through some accident, I do exactly that to you. I get you pregnant. Once you know you're pregnant, there's no harm in getting fucked and pumped full of cum regularly. \n\n---\n\n * (17) Tinder\n\n---\n\nIt's 2am and you're not quite sure why you're still awake. You're in bed and insanely horny, and foolishly swiping on Tinder. Only 9s and 10s of course and matching most of them too. You throw a few messages out there and put your phone down, deciding that at that time and your level of horniness, you probably shouldn't be Tindering. You opt to relieve yourself through porn instead, opening up your favorite porn site and finding something suitable. After a good 30minutes of playing with yourself, just before you decide to cum, your phone pings. \n\n**Match with Ryan** \n\nInstinctively you unlock your phone and check out my profile. You remember swiping right on me. You remember thinking that I had phenomenal bulge, practically bursting out of the boxer briefs I'm wearing in my profile pic. The next pics reveal much more of the same; a big bulge barely covered by tight, revealing clothing. It's only now, having seen a handful of pics of me that you notice that my face is super young and innocent looking. You're instantly a little reserved about it. You've matched with guys who have 18 in their profile but end up being 16 or 17 before. Before you can overthink it, your phone pings again, this time the result of my message.\n\n\"Hey\"\n\n\"Hey! You're up late!\" You reply. \"Can I ask you something? Are you really 18? I just want to be sure.\"\n\n\"I'm not actually, is that OK?\" I answer honestly whilst avoiding the real question.\n\n\"How old are you?\" you reply, matter-of-factly.\n\n\"I'm 11.\"\n\nEleven?! You think. You don't reply. You can't reply. Can you? You find yourself looking at my pictures again, taking in my insane bulge, easily one of the largest you'd ever seen. Somehow, it belongs to a 11yr old and somehow you find your hand is back on your pussy.\n\n---\n\nI'm also very open to other scenes if you can come up with something along these lines that you would like better. Or if you would like to change some stuff around to the scenes I've done up; that's fine too. Don't be shy and I can't wait to hear from you! ;)","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AgeplayPenPals","subreddit_id":"t5_3656x","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[m4F] I'm looking for a long term, descriptive, and detailed partner.

I it currently is 4:13 am here and I am sober, and have been for the past 3 days.\n\nMy question, basically, is when you guys realized you weren't just \"enjoying life\" when it comes to drinking but could not control it and alcohol has taken over your life. For the last 5-6 months I realized I have a problem and that I needed to stop, since even for my own very lax standards I am going over board lets say, but casually ignored this realization and continued anyway.\n\nWhat scares me the most is just in retrospect how far it escalated, and how well I learned how to function with it. Alcohol has been a big part of my life since I was 16 (I am 28 now).\n\nTo get some perspective, I think I am (still) a pretty self-sufficient adult. I have a decent job in a large corporation, am financially independent, and have been able to live in a lot of countries. I go to work hungover more often than not and most people just take it for granted since I do my job anyway (a bit of a \"in the land of the blind\" type situation).\n\nBut here is the thing: I realize what I am doing is absolutely doing me no good. It makes me lazy, prevents me from doing other activities, it prevents my own growth as a person, and has destroyed the most meaningful relationship in my life. It is expensive, unhealthy, and leads to terrible decision making I often regret. The quantities I drink are quite enormous. When I used to drink in my college days, in a good night out I might've drank 8 \"pints\" (=half litres) of beer, cause hey I am a student right and this is what students do. Now it is not uncommon for me to drink this much on a Monday night by myself. I often buy 4 cans but will go out later at night to get more (no driving), and I have developed strategies to not go to the same place twice a night because I will buy 2, go home, go to another place and repeat and repeat. If I include all the drinks I have over the course of a regular week, I probably drink around 50-60 pints or more because often the nights are blurry (although less and less so, even if I drink the same or even more than before... which is frightening by itself). At this point I know I cannot control it. I might be (semi)-functioning now but realize at one point I won't be.\n\nBut still I am just unable to NOT do it. To stay home when my friends ask me to go out, to not have those beers after work, to be able to imagine never being able to do this anymore. I always thought it was just a phase I would grow out of; or I drank because I moved and wanted to explore the city or because my now ex broke up with me and now I needed to go out and meet new people, or I would stop it when I would be older and get a steady job. None of these things turned out to be true.\n\nSo yes, basically, I want to know what motivated you guys to stop, or at least the motivational point to try. Currently, I am just afraid that I cannot stop untill I hit rock bottom, if that makes sense... and the frightening realization that even then the drinking would probably continue. Because I am an Alcoholic, and I cannot control my drinking.\n\nAnyhow, hopes some of this makes sense... if it violates some rules/includes triggers just lemme know and I will delete, and it feels good to get this off of my chest.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stopdrinking","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7yr","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"When was your \"come to jesus\" moment when you realized you were an alcoholic?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7a0xkx/when_was_your_come_to_jesus_moment_when_you/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

They're a handful of years away from retirement and not anywhere close to where they should be financially. They split about 10 years ago. My Dad has a six-figure income in addition to his new wife's moderate income, but just recently leased a car and seems to always be making big purchases (new Harley last year, car this year, house about 5 years ago, inground pool about 3 years ago), so I highly doubt he's FI. Both him and his wife will have a good pension though, so I'm not worried about them there, more about what they're showing my brother. My Mom is in a much worse position; she's not making much money doing jobs here and there, living in an apartment, with no pension. I don't know what happened when they split, but she always complains about my Dad wrecking her credit, and I think she's still in some debt from that. I'm fairly sure the child support my Dad pays her is about 50% of what she's living off of, so I'm worried about what she's gonna do after that stops in a couple years. Anyway, their future is a discussion for a different post, but I'm setting the scene here. They clearly didn't teach me and my middle brother well; I'm climbing out of ~$16k CC debt since the beginning of this year (down to $6.5k now, with the help of you guys and a bunch of books), and my middle brother blew through a $60k accident settlement in two years. I highly doubt they did anything different with my youngest brother, so I want to make sure he doesn't end up like me.\n\nMy youngest brother is 15 and primarily living with my Mom, I'm 14 years older and not living near home. He's not working yet, but he wants to pick up a job in the spring and start making money. He hasn't said specifically for what, but I know a car purchase will be coming within the next year or two. Not living near home, I'm hoping to give him some material he can look over and work on his own. What books or products would be good for him? I'd also be open to doing anything else for him like opening accounts and things like that, and monitor what's happening. I would like him to have an account my Mom can't get to. I really don't think she's like that at all, but again, I'm worried about what's going to happen once the alimony stops, just don't want to chance it. Do you think it would be good to open a joint account with him now? I really wanted to be able to do some sort of savings-match for him, but I just don't think I'm in a financial position to do that. I've read the sidebar links and do have my own opinions, but I'd really love to hear from you guys. Reddit, what can I do for him?\n\nTl;dr: I need to financially educate my 15 year old brother and set him up for the future, how can I best do that?\n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"How can I financially educate my 15-year-old brother?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7a11wf/how_can_i_financially_educate_my_15yearold_brother/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
