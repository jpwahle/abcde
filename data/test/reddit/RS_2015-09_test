I am trying to start an online clothing business(mainly starting out with t-shirts)and I have ALOT of questions I want to ask. Bare with me because I am a complete newbie when it comes to this topic which is why I came to Reddit to request help from the professionals. It is a lot of questions but it could also help others as well who are wondering the same thing as me. Thanks in advance! P.S. Sorry for the wall of text.....\n\nFirst off, the **manufacturer**: What company has a reasonable price while maintaining good quality products? I looked into this one a bit and I came down to American Apparel, Next Level, Bella Canvas, etc. I want to ask to those who have used these companies to create your products: is it actually worth the money and how does it feel? \nThe quality of shirts from these companies may be good however I feel like as a business starting out, it could be a bit pricey. I would love to know about companies that have exceptional quality products yet cheaper than the ones I listed if possible.\n\n**Printing Method and screen printers**: This one is a bit tricky because there are several methods when it comes down to printing designs. I've read multiple posts on other forums and I still have a hard time understanding as to which x method is good for y quality shirts or which method is used for what kind of designs. I would appreciate if someone could break it down and literally explain it to me like I'm 5 years old. Also from your guys' first hand experience, which screen printers would you recommend? Just like the t-shirts, I'm not looking to spend an overbearing amount as a startup so I'm looking for quality screen printers, but affordable at the same time. \n\n**Custom Tags**: I'm pretty dead set on having custom tags with my company logo on it but I'm not sure what other information are needed. What I see on a lot of tags are wash instructions, where it is made(new Zealand for example), and material such as cotton. I'm wondering what is legally required to be written on the tags and what can I customly write on my tags.\n\n**Hang Tags**: This I don't have a very good idea as to what is a good price, what is needed on it, or if it's even necessary at all. I have seen many brands with hang tags and it does make them look a lot more professional but I am wondering if it's even worth the investment. Will boost my sale? Is it worth the hassle? If so, I'd like all the information available such as the best manufacturer for hang tags and what is considered a good deal on them.\n\n**Custom Package**: In order for our company to stand out more so than others I want to create a unique packaging. I feel as if clothes are limited as to how you can make the customer feel more appreciative. With a unique packaging, I want the customer to feel like they're getting their moneys worth as well as something a little more than just a shirt with their purchases. I would appreciate it if someone who uses or used packaging can provide all the details such as: manufacturer, price (what is considered cheap), and what should be included in the packaging.(such as details, etc)\nwww.howtostartaclothingcompany.com/t-shirt-packaging/ This website is a good example of what I am talking about.\n\n**Inventory**: I've read an article that suggested that 36 is a good number for startups. It explains that 1-2-2-1 or 1-1-2-2 (1-2-2-1 meaning 1 small \u2013 2 medium \u2013 2 large \u2013 1 X-large) is the best sizes you can have. 36 products will be 6-12-12-6 following the method above. However, I also want to hear your guys' opinion on what the best way to stock your products is. The most conservative method that will have the products when needed but can order more and waste the least amount.\n\n**Shipping and handling**: What do most clothing companies use to ship their products throughout the state or out of state? Which shipping company is the most cost efficient, reliable and fast? \nRegistering the company: Is it necessary to register as LLC even if it is an brand new online store and I don't know the outcome of our store? Please in detail inform me why.\n\n**Refunds**: I've noticed a lot of websites that have 100% guaranteed refunds. How do they deal with this? What are some other common return policies that will satisfy the customer yet will give me the upper advantage and what do i do with the returned items if it's faulty? And what if there's nothing wrong with it? Also I'm sure there are people who'll have many reasons, even it may not be the item's fault, that'll make up reasons to get a refund. What do I do in that case? \n\n**Website**: Everyone needs a website. However, I want to try to use the website as a \"unique shopping experience\" to attract customers. Is it worth it to spend a lot of $ on a custom website to use the website as a form of advertisement, meaning people will be at awe at how different and unique the website is compared to other shopping websites. Obviously the products will be on par with the website so it won't be so one sided.(Good website and good products) \n\n**Promotions and mailing list**: When you first enter a website, you sometimes see a popup that asks you to sign up for a mailing list. I'm wondering what information I should include on the promotion popup and the emails I send out to our mailing list subscribers. Also, what are good ideas for promotions?\n\n**Payment Method**: I want the customers to have as many choices as possible when purchasing our products. Some payment method I have in mind are credit card, Paypal and bitcoin if possible. I'm wondering to those who have an online shop and make daily sales, which company is reliable and efficient with the lowest transaction fees and will earn you the most in the long run. Also I'm wondering if it is possible to get scammed such as drawbacks on Paypal and how to go about it if that were to happen. Some online payment companies I have in mind: Paypal and Stripe\n\n**Legal Policies**: I'm not quite sure how to write the FAQs or privacy policies but I do feel like it is a way to gain the customers trust. I'm wondering if I need to hire a lawyer to write the legal stuff or if there is any other way of approaching it. \n\n**Subscriptions that could boost the sale**: I was wondering if paying the subscription fees to sites like Amazon for $40 a month would be a good idea to boost our sales up. Also another idea I have is paying for a live support such as Zopim for around $20-$25 a month to potentially increase our sales in that form. I would love to hear your input on this. \n\nWhat are some tips on making your store look as legit and professional as possible? How do I gain the customers trust? Any tips that you've learned over the course of time will be an abundance of help for me.\n\n**San Diego Area Manufacturers and Printers**??? Before I settle on an actual online manufacturers, I want to see if local companies can create amazing products that are on par but for a cheaper price. I also want to learn the different types of printing method so I have a better idea of which design suits better for each method and material. Of course this is a question for those who live in San Diego area that share the same passion as me.","author_flair_text":null,"name":"t3_3j5kj3","secure_media_embed":{},"subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","archived":false,"gilded":0,"locked":false,"from":null,"retrieved_on":1450827571,"over_18":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3j5kj3/questions_regarding_tshirt_business_about/","score":9,"ups":9,"permalink":"/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3j5kj3/questions_regarding_tshirt_business_about/","from_kind":null,"author":"lambosambo","stickied":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false}

They're afraid I'm going to end up killed or something.

I came out this month to all of my friends and family, which resulted in losing all my friends, my family,  my job, my house, and my girlfriend. I am now officially in therapy, I have my HRT prescription, am scheduled for my first electrolysis, made a new friend, and experienced something I had never thought imaginable.  \n  \nA little about me, I live in my car now, have only one friend, no family, no job, and am starving, but for some reason I have never been happier. Not the kind of happy a new outfit gets you, or the kind you get when you go out for a few drinks, but this feeling deep inside that I can't fully explain.\n\nI was raised marine corps, and men and women had two very different roles to play in this world. When I was 16 I came out to a small group of friends and I started cross dressing. This didn't last long as I would eventually run away from home, because my mother didn't approve of my boyfriend. I didn't really understand gender and sexuality, so I assumed I was a gay freak who liked ladies underwear and begged to have breasts like my sister. Eventually those friends moved on and my little runaway game was getting serious. I was a homeless without a cent to my name, and no place to stay warm. So I started doing less than acceptable things for money. Anything from prostitution, \"sales\", and other even more unspeakable things. I became a person with whom others found trustworthy, you could say I gained others  \"confidence\" without much difficulty.   \n\nFast forward to 2004, and I met who I would call the love of my life. My lovely lesbian lover who accepted the girly bitch I was on the inside. This would last for many years, and I was taking life in like ambrosia. Good house, job, car, family, I was becoming a woman, and everything was white picket fence fantasies come true.  However, like all good things in my life. They must come to an end. I would be saying my goodbyes to my almost lover. She had grown tired of being with a \"sissy faggot\" and wanted an upgrade. She did this by cheating on me. I lived in a fantasy land, and ignored the signs.  eventually I gave up and filed for divorce.  With this new page about to turn over in the porno-thriller fantasy novel become romantic-comedy that has been my life, I packed my bags and hailed a cab, there was no dice, and it wasn't bellair to which I was destined.  \n    \nIt would be my hometown, the town that still haunted me. Dark alleys, that still had the lingering smell of my sinful deeds. The people I once marked remembered me and the games I played. Enemies, and people who had grown to hate me with a seething rage at every corner.  I wasn't in town for more than a week, when I had been assaulted and hospitalized as punishment for my past and it wicked ways. I needed a place to stay, and I needed protection. So I took off my big-girl panties, and had to once again forgo my true-self and turn to the street-life for survival. I would live the same life I lived in my earlier years, but with an extra dash of ultra-violence!  This time, I would snuff that whore so far inside of me she would never see the light of day. \n  \n  \nFrom 2009 to 2011 I was homeless, and doing whatever \"jobs\" I could to make a \"living\". I would eventually find a group of people who thought I was their friend, who offered me protection, loosely termed employment, and all the basic needs a \"man\" would ever need. I started lifting weights, and doing MMA. Officially a \"real man\" at 200 lb and a ass-kicking monster, who fucked bitches, drank beer, and did all the stuff men enjoyed. \n  \n I lived this way until 2014 when I met my recently not Ex girlfriend. This person, who I had fallen madly for, sparked something inside of me I had honestly forgotten. She released Viktoria from her grave, bursting out with a fiery vengeance. With Viktoria came all my demons to the forefront. Memories so haunting I have had therapists report they couldn't personally manage my case, referring me to other providers. She thought perhaps my inner demons were merely some parental abuse, or a minor case of abandonment, but what she would hear changed her and broke her, and would even broke us apart. \n  \nWe're now finally full circle, 1, September 2015 and I am two years free of my \"old life\" I am 6 months sober, and everything has fallen apart, but something happened after I left my therapists office today with my chemical womanhood makers in hand. I broke down, and fell to my knees and cried. I cried so hard it hurt my lungs, and my face burned. I had not cried, not one single tear my entire life. It hurt, and it disoriented me, but it was this feeling of freedom so intense that it's left me with such a wide array of emotions, I am not fully sure what to do with myself. I actually cried, I had always seen others do it, but could never imagine how amazing it feels when you're finished. I am finally becoming human, a good person, and above all... myself. \n\nThank you all for reading, I tried to make it entertaining as possible. And I hope for anybody out there feeling there's little reason to go on with this fucked up existence we call life. I want my story to bring hope and meaning to your life. May you get to understand the freedom something as simple as tears can bring you, and what perseverance can mean in the bigger picture. "}

I don't believe he would ever do anything to hurt me, and he is very clear about seeing us as a couple for the long term. \n\nThe problem may arise from my own insecurities and have nothing to do with him, but I am unsure.

I sometimes feel as though I should end this before I get too dependent on him. I have always been independent and relied on myself alone. Even with friends, I distance myself from them when I find that I am becoming too reliant. I would rather sabotage relationships than allow myself the vulnerability of being hurt or used. He has done nothing to indicate that he is using me, and we have not gone far physically and he respects that I want to wait until I'm certain that I'm ready (I'm 21 and a virgin, he is late 20's and not a virgin). I also fear that sex will cause me to get even more attached to him and this is probably the main reason I am waiting. I don't want to have sex with him and then have this relationship end, since to me sex is a big deal. I also fear that he will get bored of me after sex, even though I know he likes me for who I am and is content with waiting. \n\nAll in all, I am unable to stop my cycle of getting close to him and then distancing myself when I feel myself opening up to him.

I'm 22 and I have the self-esteem of a depressed eighth grader, I feel like such a dud. I've never kept friends for long, mostly because I've made bad choices with who I decided to spend my time on. I'm nearly always inviting myself, and for as long as I can remember I've always been envious of other people's lives. I don't feel like I'm important to anyone, not even myself. I feel like my life has no substance, my family is split down the middle, I can't see one side without it being a trust issue for the other side. It pisses me off so much it makes me wanna ditch them all together, which makes me feel awful, but I can't help it. I'm so jealous of people who have structure and meaning to their lives, I want to be that person who has a job and who has really close friends and roommates who they go out with every weekend, but I'm the guest, I'm always the guest, my presence is only appropriate in those people's lives to a certain extent. The most important people are my family, and I can't have all of them without it being a problem. I hate everything so much and I'm so angry all the time I just hate people who are successful in life and love, it makes me feel sick and sad that I'm like that, I wish I could be that Hallmark-like person who's been through tough shit but still has a big heart but I'm not. I'm full of anger and it's so hard to let go of when I feel like I'm doomed to a life of loneliness. Why can't I be like normal people with normal relationships and friendships? I feel so left out, I always have. As a kid I was generally rejected by boys, while girls would let me in but always kind of held things over my head. In some ways that never changed, now I'm not gay enough to fit in with the gay crowd and I'm not straight enough to have close straight guy friends. The most I've achieved are girl friends who treat me like \"the gay friend\" and who sleep with guys who I like, which I know I can't hold against them, I never did, but it still fucking hurts. I'm afraid I might never get my turn, I graduated from college, and I never quite got into my place, I never really felt like I was anything. What now? I feel so defeated, I feel like there's nothing left to do but accept that life just isn't fair sometimes and that I'll never feel companionship like I want to. I'm so angry at the world, I was patient, more than patient, but I've had enough.

I am 29 still living with my parents never left home. I've been saving quite a bit of money since i first started working and now I'm at a point where it\u2019s time to leave the nest and fly on my own. I currently have zero debt under my name, pay my credit card off every month and no reoccurring bills except for phone bill ($165) I\u2019ve only had one credit card my entire life and it was first established in 2007, so i only have one line of credit instead of the usual 3 which will get  to down below.\nAs far as liquid assets I have $102,087 spread around 5 different banks ranging from two locals to 3 online banks. \nOn top of that for my IRA/Traditional I have a combine total of 26,943. \nLastly, I have two 401k, combined total is 34,176. One of the 401k is with my currently employer (UTC) and the other one is from a previous employers from early 2009. Not much growth has been seen with that money. So my question will be what are the best options? That 401k is through fidelity \nOption 1: withdraw all into cash with penalty, which to me is dumb \nOption 2: roll it over into an IRA, I like the idea but what are the pros and cons of doing that? I can also roll it over to my other IRA through capital 360?\nOption 3: roll it over to my currently employer 401k, to me I think this is the best option since I may get more bang for my buck in long term earnings.  \nFor my current employer I\u2019m putting 15% of my paycheck towards my 401k and they are also matching up to 6%. It\u2019s a good chunk of my paycheck and since living at home I can afford to do that. This will all change once I move out of the house in to my own house. 15% will turn in to 6% and gradually grown from here until I figure out what I\u2019m able to afford.  I will also add that I\u2019m hourly but I have a salary of 40,454. I do get paid over time but it\u2019s not factored into my base pay. It\u2019s considered a separate category.  \nHere comes the real questions now. I am currently in the market to buy a house, I actually found one and put in an offer of 200k. (May be able to get it for 215k the lowest all depends I guess) I offered to put a down payment of 80k on the house, when checking my credit they gave me scores of, (rough estimate) 740ish, 760ish, and last 789. The mortgage Brooker told me that they\u2019ll be using the middle score. Not sure why that score, if anybody knows please let me know. Why is it, that 3 lines of credit is necessary when buying anything big? Wouldn\u2019t making payments on time for 8 years be sufficient in the fact that I am responsible with my money?\nOther question is, when shopping around for quotes, do Brookers typically do a hard credit check or soft credit check? I would like to shop around to find the best possible deal. What are some key things I should be looking for?\nWhen the mortgage Brooker quoted me, he stated that I\u2019m not qualified for first time home buyer since I\u2019m putting more than 20% down, and how I won\u2019t have to worry about PMI. Are there alternative to getting a better mortgage rate or program? He also gave me different scenarios of different amounts put down as a down payment, it seemed that every 10k above that 20% threshold dropped the monthly mortgage by 50$ so all together it would be 200$ saved if I actually put 80k down. To me it almost seemed as if he wanted me to go down that route, not sure if it\u2019s for his benefit or towards mine. I would love to get some insight on this if possible I appreciate the help and any question you guys have I\u2019ll be willing to answer. \nAll together my monthly mortgage was quote to be around 1000-1200, that includes a rough estimate of insurance and taxes. Based off my salary I feel as if I cannot live comfortable with a mortgage rate of that based off of my current salary. (Side note I will be living alone, worse comes to worse I can easily find a roommate)\nThanks \n","from_id":null,"from":null,"retrieved_on":1450827479,"locked":false,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","name":"t3_3j5rjv","secure_media_embed":{}}

When I posted my first real encounter with Neckbeard Bob, although it was only the first part of a very long story with many, many events that could conceivably have run for 20 - 30 submissions, I honestly expected that I'd be nearing the end now, or at least more than halfway through. However, I didn't anticipate the forum's response to it! It has been praised as hilarious, entertaining, a \"visceral pleasure that makes me feel like I'm right there with you guys\", engrossing, one of the best Neckbeard Stories ever submitted to this sub &amp; more many, many times by me. However, its detractors have called it mean, heartless, written by a Neckbeard, bullying, overboard etc, and those are the nicer ones! The truly venomous ones are usually personal messages, where I've been told that people want to fite me 1v1 irl, punch me in the face, rape my girlfriend &amp; kill me, etc. I hoped that the second installment would calm down the mob calling for my head on a stick, but instead it only seemed to be akin to pouring oil on the fire. So I thought it was prudent to wait until the deluge of negativity had slowed to a trickle before continuing. I think it's only fair to the few fans I have (believe it or not, they do exist!) and I'm still totally confident that in time I will win you guys over yet, as Bob is revealed in all his beardy glory, and that you guys' hard-on for praising him whilst viciously attacking me will fade. Also, I &amp; my experience with NB has been called a lot of things, but very rarely boring (I'm anticipating lots of comments now claiming this is boring, which will be very witty &amp; clever). Anyway, without further ado, onto the next chapter in my interactions with Neckbeard Bob! \n\nSo in this story:\n\nThere's me, Damien, studying English Literature, though around the time where this story takes place I transfer to pharmacy/chemistry. I'm 6'1, my first love is my guitar which I love playing, solo &amp; to entertain others, I love going to music festivals and used to dream of playing one, I adore reading fiction &amp; non-fiction, and my perfect weekend consisted of having a smoke or a drink with my friends.\n\nJenny is my best friend's girlfriend - a pretty, short &amp; vivacious girl with a heart of gold. The kindest person I've ever met and the girlfriend of my best friend. \n\nSam is my best friend. My confidant, my wingman, my closest bro - we go way back, at first united by our love of metal, whereas I grew out of metal and he didn't, our bond has only strengthened over the years.\n\nMichael, one of the smartest guys I know, really chill, funny, stoner/surfer studying Applied Mathematics. \n\nRichard is one of Michael's buddies, and was a relatively new addition the group, but was quickly earning his place as one of the bros. Massively into drugs &amp; writing, a little crazy but in a good way, has a boyfriend who we rarely saw and studying Philosophy.\n\nRachel was another one of the bros - totally drop-dead gorgeous, heads would turn wherever she went, addicted to posting photos of herself and a little vain but harmless as long as you didn't cross her, she was feisty and fun to be around.\n\nThen there's the rest of the bros - Jotham and Jamie, though they don't feature in this particular installment.\n\nAnd of course the star of the show - Neckbeard Bob. A very, stupidly skinny &amp; short guy, literally wears fedoras, after being mercilessly mocked for months about them switched to bowler hats with fedoras only occasionally thrown into the mix, other outfit staples include shirts with \"funny\" slogans, \"plain lazy\" appears to be a favorite, dad jeans and old, shitty sneakers. By this point he was attempting to grow a beard, which consisted of some straggly, unkempt pube-like hairs all over his chin &amp; neck, weirdly light in contrast to his hair. Not the most socially-adjusted guy I know, to put it mildly.\n\nSo after the last tale, where with a little prompting from me &amp; Jotham NB had asked out Rachel in perhaps the worst way possible, and been shot down and humiliated as a result, we didn't see NB for a while. Our whole group had a good laugh about it recounting the incident, other than Jenny who was angry with us and berated our \"insensitivity\" and again claimed NB was a \"nice guy\". Rachel was also really pissed at us when she found out what we had done, but she got over it and eventually laughed when reflecting on it. According to Jenny he hadn't been in their shared Ancient History class since it happened, and he wasn't seen on campus again until over a fortnight later. He did his best to avoid us all, and when we did come across him he would power-walk away with his eyes glued to the floor. If I happened to be with Rachel, he'd repeat this but his face would be noticeably flushed red. We kinda forgot about him and only Jenny ever spoke to him now &amp; again in their class, where I later found out she apologized for us, and NB asked Jenny to apologize to Rachel on his behalf. \n\nSo we didn't speak to him again for a while. The only thing that really changed was that after a couple of weeks NB went from awkwardly hovering around by himself in between classes to sitting at a table in the library playing a card game (not like poker, it was yu-gi-oh or digimon or something along those lines) with an asian guy I didn't know and a nerdy looking kid who I'd never heard speak.  \n\nOne day, on a Wednesday afternoon that me, Jenny, Sam &amp; Michael shared, where we had a custom of all meeting and heading into the city (only a &lt;10 minute walk away) and hanging out in a shopping center there (a \"mall\") and getting food, browsing stores and just generally relaxing as we all had at least two hours free. However, just as we're waiting at the western entrance where we usually meet, Jenny sends a text to Sam saying that she can't make it. Puzzled and wondering if they were still going out *after* their classes finished that day, he called her. Me &amp; Michael were surprised to hear peals of laughter erupt from him halfway through the call, and exchange a puzzled look. When he gets off the phone he's still giggling. \n\n\"We have GOT to see this!\" Sam insists, and leads us back onto the campus, without hinting to me or Michael what on earth was going on. He leads us to the library, and takes us to the entrance to one of the \"communal\" study rooms (the study rooms are split into communal, focused and personal, with the active ones allowing talking, eating, etc). He shushes us before we go in, and then we enter.\n\nIt's pretty busy, with only a couple of tables free out of the around thirty circular tables in the large room, and Michael is the first to spot what Sam had lead us to.\n\n\"You have GOT to be kidding me!\" \n\nFollowing his gaze, I see what the big deal is. NB is sitting with his friend, Asian Dweeb and White Dweeb, and with them is JENNY! Holding some cards!! Me and Sam burst out laughing but Sam shushes us.\n\n\"How about we observe Neckbeard Bob in his natural habitat, guys?\" he says with a smirk, and we both decide that's the best idea as we silence our giggles. So we take a table that's just about within earshot of their table, but far enough away so they can't spot us. NB and Jenny have their backs to us, and only AD and WD can actually see us without turning around, which aids in our remaining undetected.\n\nThis instance genuinely surprised me. The NB that I'd met was extremely timid, awkward, quiet, like a scared little mouse ready to scurry back into his hole at a moment's notice. This NB was different though - he sat with his legs spread, one arm draped over the back of his chair, bowler hat tilted back, cracking jokes and talking among his friends, regularly pausing to explain the game to Jenny. \n\nAfter a minute, I saw a particularly surprising example of his apparent alter-ego. Obviously I don't remember the particulars of the technicalities of the rules of the game he was explaining, so I'm just going to improve those, but I can remember the tone and his actions crystal-clear.\n\nJenny put down some card, to which NB responded \"Really? You're going to play a blue goblin even though D1 has a green goblin in play? Oh Jenny, you might as well be playing a troll against a dragon!!\" to which D1 and D2 both burst out laughing, and Jenny did a very weak forced laugh, which we can all spot from a mile away, as Jenny's real laugh is quite loud and expansive, this was like a quiet \"heh\". What happened next even made Michael stop laughing to himself and look wide-eyed. \n\nNB leaned over to teach Jenny something about the game, and got 3 cards out of the pile and was showing them to her, and he put his hand on her lower back and leaned right into her space to direct her eyes to the cards! I was shocked at how forward NB was being, as he was usually so timid and shy, I had honestly thought that he'd never even been this close to a woman before, let alone made physical contact! But there he was, with his pale little hand on Jenny's back. Me and Michael exchanged glances and looked at Sam, who was looking open-mouthed over at them. \n\n\"So you see now? Okay, just let me know if you need any more help\" we heard him say, before moving both hands up to squeeze her shoulders, then going back to the game. Jenny seemed totally unfazed, but we were all totally shocked. \n\nNot two minutes after that, Jenny had put a card down and NB coo'ed to her \"Oh no, not like that dear, let me show you\" and he PUT HIS HAND OVER HER HAND and guided it back to her cards, then using her hand picked another card out. At this point we were like what the fuck!? We couldn't see Jenny's reaction as she had her back to us but judging by her body language she was getting a little uncomfortable at this point, and her body seemed to draw into itself a little. A couple of minutes after that when Jenny put down another card, NB said to her \"Thats it, you're learning\" and ran his hand down her back from the top to almost the bottom of her spine. \n\nAt this point, Sam had seen way too much already. \"Okay guys, I think its time we say hello to old Bobby!\" he exclaimed, and I could hear the anger in his voice. I was still stunned, Jenny had always stood up for NB and called him a nice guy, and I had wondered why she talked him up so much despite him being a complete dweeb who had no friends and barely said a word. Now it seemed like he had taken her natural kindness to heart, and was getting way too cocky. I tried to shake off my surprise as me and Michael tailed after Sam, who was striding towards their table.\n\n\"Bob! Jenny! Fancy seeing you hear!\" Sam said, a little too loudly, as he got to the table. \"Real nice to see you, Bob!\" he said, and in an pseudo-friendly gesture he slapped Bob's back, but he did it way way harder than one would under normal circumstances, to the point where Bob was physically launched forward in his chair and dropped the cards. Michael and I smirked. \n\n\"Mind if we see what you guys are up to?\" I asked in a jovial tone, as we all grabbed chairs from nearby and sat around. \n\n\"Let me introduce us, I'm Sam, Jenny's BOYFRIEND\" he said, adding a lot of emphasis, glaring straight at Bob, \"but wait, you knew that didn't you? Silly me. And this is Damien and Michael. Who are your little friends?\" he enquired, staring at Bob straight in the eye.\n\nIt was amusing &amp; surprising to watch Bob visibly deflate in our presence. He seemed to instinctively close his legs, he hunched his back, he started looking at the ground as his face flushed bright red, and he suddenly seemed extremely uncomfortable. I couldn't help but note Dweebs 1 &amp; 2 look at each other slightly confused - this was going to be fun! I guess they hadn't see the real Neckbeard Bob before! Well, it was going to be educational at least. \n\n\"W-well\" the glorious stammer returns!!\" \"-t-this is Dequan, and this is Tim\". \n\n\"How nice that you have friends, now. I mean, how nice for you to have people to hang around with. Oh my, what am I saying? I mean how nice that you're not lonely. Oh dear, what a I even trying to say! Come on Sam!\" he said to himself sarcastically \"How nice that you have people to play games with, is what i'm trying to say\"\n\nThis just killed me and Michael, and we couldn't stop ourselves from audibly laughing. Bob's face contorted into that audible traumatized look that we had come to know and love. \n\n\"I thought you guys were going to the Bull Ring?\" Jenny asked, seeming not angry, but a little concerned. To be honest her demeanor seemed quite a lot chirpier after seeing us, but I saw her glare at Sam and mouth the word \"behave!\" whilst Bob's eyes were firmly glued to the floor.\n\n\"We just wanted to see what game you guys are playing. I've seen you guys playing this a few times, and it always looked so  cool! Like golly gosh, those cool monsters and stuff!\" Michael said sarcastically, and I smirked. \n\n\"Well, Yu-Gi-Oh is pretty awesome! I can teach you guys if you want! I compete in the regionals around here, I even taught Robert how to play. It's really really fun when you get into it!\" D1 said, seemingly oblivious to the sarcasm. \n\n\"Great! What do you say, Bobby? Will you let us play your little monster game?\" Sam asked, to which Bob meekly nodded. \"Let me see your cards!\" he asked, and then swiped all of Bob's pile, as well as the cards in the middle, and started flipping through them. He got more and more careless, until he was literally throwing them over his shoulder after he'd looked at it and moved onto the next one, whilst me and Michael giggled.\n\n\"Be careful with those! They're Bob's!\" Jenny said, and then ran to pick them up. \n\n\"Hey Bob, are you going to let JENNY pick up YOUR cards? Come on dude, be a gentleman!\" I said, and Bob shot to his feet, and ran around to pick up the cards as Sam threw them onto the floor.\n\n\"You guys should be a bit more careful! Those cards are pretty valuab-\" D1 started, before I shot him the meanest glare I could.\n\n\"We're just having FUN with our FRIEND Bob, here. You're not our FRIEND yet, that's why we're not having so much FUN with you. You understand?\" I said, spelling it out to him that if he didn't shut up he'd be next. That silenced him, and he spent the next few minutes staring at his cards. Jenny had gotten up at this point and was adjusting her hair.\n\n\"So how've you been finding the uhh...game?\" Michael asked, but motioned at Bob with his eyes. Jenny bit her lip, then said \"Urm, its a lot more INTENSE than I thought, you know? Especially playing with Bob's friends too...\" That made sense. Young Bobby here was trying to show off in front of his buddies. I saw Sam's expression soften at hearing this, I think he'd gotten all wound up because he was worried this was regular behavior that Jenny had been encouraging.\n\n\"H-h-hey could you, like, maybe stop doing that?\" Bob said, maybe taking note of the shocked expression on his friend's faces, used to the confident, alpha-nerd and Card Master or whatever, surprised at seeing him reduced to a small, stuttering, timid mess, crawling around on the floor to pick up his own cards that Sam was throwing down.\n\n\"Ohh! Is that what I was doing? Sorry man, I can get so careless sometimes. Hey, why is this one in a little packet?\" he asked, holding up a card that had a gold building on it. I later found out it was called a Gold Sarcophagus, as we looked it up later, for reasons that will become apparent.\n\n\"Because that card is incredibly valuable!\" D1 piped up again. This motherfucker was chatty and apparently oblivious to the situation that he was in \"It was a very limited release, and it will only get more valuable as time goes on.\" \n\n\"Really? You know what would be even more valuable?\" Sam asked, to which D1 and D2 shook their heads. \"What if he had TWO of them?\" \n\nSam then proceeded to pull the card out of its little plastic packet, and rip it in half, staring Bob in the eye the whole time. Bob immediately jumped forward to catch the pieces, and looked totally distraught. \n\n\"I--I w-why would you do this!?\" he asked, seemingly growing balls at the sight of his destroyed card. \n\n\"Oh, Sam! Bob really likes this game!\" Jenny said, sounding slightly irate rather than genuinely angry. I laughed when I saw it, I must admit Sam can be a cold motherfucker when he wants to be. \n\n\"I-I have to go\" Bob muttered and started to gather up all his stuff. We made to leave as well, but we were interrupted as Richard strolled over to us. \n\n\"Hey guys! Oh my God, I have been looking for you all day! Don't you even LOOK at your phone Michael? Tsk-tsk! Listen, this weekend, my parent's country house, all weekend party! You guys HAVE to come, I've already invited loads of people, including Rachel and Jotham. Here's the address, bring your friends as well\" he motioned at NB and D1 and D2. I inwardly cursed how friendly Richard was, he'd clearly assume we were all friends. However, I wasn't too worried - I highly doubted Bob was going to turn up after the last time he came out with us. \n\n\"Sure! We'll be there, sounds great man!\" I said.\n\n\"Oh wow! Really?\" D2 said, breaking out in a huge smile.\n\n\"Sure, any friends of these guys are welcome\" Richard said, smiling. \n\n\"Well-\" Michael started, before Jenny cut him off with \"That sounds great Richard\" before Michael had a chance to distance himself from the 3 of them. Richard passed out a typed card with the address on it to everyone, then left. NB's face looked a little less like it was about to burst into tears, but he muttered a thanks to Richard before leaving. \n\nWe got our things together, Jenny said goodbye to D1 and D2, and we left. Sam was pretty happy after that, and didn't really question why NB was acting the way he was, although on our way into the city Jenny mentioned that Bob had been acting \"weird\" and that she wasn't used to him being like that, and reprimanded us a little for going hard on him.\n\n\"You guys need to stop giving Robert such a tough time! If you just gave him a real chance, you'd see he's a really good guy!\" she exclaimed for what seemed like the millionth time. \n\nOh Jenny, if only you knew what was in store....\n\n---------\n\nSo that's it, folks! The next installment is one of my favorite memories of all time, not just with NB but in my life, and I'm sure that you'll enjoy it.

I am a lot like that friend of mine, I do things my own way and would like to live aboard (I am 27 and still live with parents) Sadly, my friend passed away in an accident in December. If he were here today, I'd be calling him and hanging out with him, learning more.\n\nIn the past, my family owned a 35' mainship mediterranean - it was a beautiful boat, but we sold it cheap to afford medical assistance for my grandmother. The new owner loves and maintains it but we have no interest in buying it back because it was a nightmare to work on those engines - Yes, it was that bad!\n\nI'm planning on moving from NY to CA fast this fall, to start enjoying life for once rather than work, work, work, work work. I'm really (sick &amp;) tired of NYC and dirty trains, long commutes, -12deg winters etc. I am positioning my career to be mostly remote at this point which is beneficial.\n\nIt seems like everyone's obsessed with money here because they NEED it like a drug. I have a budget in-mind for where I can buy-into a boat, I would like to consider my options and see what people here have to say.\n\n____\n\nI feel I'd definitely be happiest with a **houseboat**; maybe a nautaline, burns craft, or a gibson. I like restoring mid-century furniture, bikes, etc. A houseboat will afford me space for projects. I can keep my bike, workout equipment, car parts, etc. in a houseboat. I've seen some houseboats on yachtworld/craigslist for 15k-30k, which is a value, but in my opinion can be negotiated further.\n\n___\n\nSecond consideration - would be a **motoryacht** or large vessel. This is a *bad* idea, and way out of budget. My friend lived aboard a 42' Ocean Yachts that was very spacious. He spent over 150k on it though. I've seen a few large boats (ie. chris craft, Kha Shing) going for 35-75k but at that price I would go broke. They're a luxury and would probably be a great long-term home, but not something I can do immediately.\n\n____\n\nThird consideration, which I see a lot of here - is a **sailboat**. This would be my cheapest and fastest way to jump into a new life, which could be great! Long-term, I can't imagine myself living with such little space, but it covers the necessities and could still be a great investment to get out on my own finally. All I would need in the end is a place for MYSELF, I wouldn't have to entertain guests beside sexy females for a night at a time ;-)\n\nI don't sail, nor do I know how to sail.\nI have an interest in learning though.\nI would mostly use the inboard motor.\nI'd be at the marina most of the time anyway. \n\nI see dockage for sailboats cost 275/mo in most cases. Not sure about liveaboard fees but everything is included. That looks like a bargain - if I ever needed to come back to NY and work in NYC (ie. slow seasons) I can call that 275/mo 'pocket change' and hustle out of my parents house for a few months at a time.\nAt least I'd have that to fall-back on, right?\n\n____\n**I'd like to get your opinion of my options above.**\n\nHere are some questions:\n\n**How do I get wifi on a boat?**\nSince I work mostly through the internet at this point, what solutions are there for me to get hooked-up to some type of cable internet or wifi at an affordable price? I've watched a few youtube videos about it before, but still uncertain. My friend had Satellite but it was over $100/mo, which I wouldn't want to do. **Cable would be ideal.**\n\n**Has anyone ever bolted-down a computer to their boat before?**\nI would get an aluminum iMac and drill holes into the base and mount it to a desk or the kitchen table to work from.\nOr, I would buy a new Mac Pro (the black garbage can looking one) and hide it in a cupboard somewhere and HDMI it to a Samsung TV screen on the boat. If I were on a sailboat, I'm not sure how I'd do this regarding space, but it could work out. (just think tiny house, right?)\n\n**Are there issues with inverters on boats with computers?**\n\n**What do you generally pay for insurance? Would that cover theft / break-in in case someone stole something of value?**\n\n**How do marina's or fellow boaters treat liveaboards? Is there any negativity for living cheaper and taking advantage of what the marina offers?**\n\n**Is there a 'liveaboard fundamental guide' I should check out?**\n\n**Where else can I get information about living aboard beside Reddit?**\n\n**What kind of Air Conditioner do you use on your boat?**\n\n**Are hot water showers possible on a boat?

If you choose to skip it (it\u2019s a pretty good read), here\u2019s a TL;DR.\n\nTL;DR: My father was deported to Peru when I was 9 after being snitched to the feds about his activity with the Mafia in New York. I have not seen him or heard from him until now\u2026 17 years later.\n\nMy father was born in Sicily. His mother died giving birth to him on the street after his father had left her. He was raised in a monastery by monks until the age of 16. On the day he was old enough to leave the monastery, a limo pulled up to pick up my father, and took him to a big mansion. He came to find out that his father was really big in the Sicilian Mafia, and had a lot of money. I don't know what he told him, but his father lied to him about why he had him stay in the monastery all this time. For a while, he worked for my father in the Mafia until his aunt from his mother's side found him and gave him all the letters she had wrote to him that his father made sure did not get to my dad. Upon finding out that his father was a player that left his mom when he found out she was pregnant, he went to a restaurant that his father owned while he was there, and gave him everything that his father had given him, and everything that he bought with the money he made from working with his father, up to the very clothes he was wearing. Standing there, now naked, one of the waiters gave him a table cloth to wrap around him. He told his father that he never wants to hear from him or have anything to do with him ever again. That very night, he hopped ship to the US.\n\n\nFast forwarding to the time he met my mother, he had already established money, power, and respect in the Mafia in New York. He was always very clandestine about his work and his past with my mother. However, it was still obvious to her that he had a lot of money. He eventually told her that he works for the Mafia, but was still very vague about what he did and who he knew. He explained that he didn't have to take a job offered and was highly respected. Maybe he was a made man. I don't know. I do know that his name is the name of his father, and was a family name. A family that was highly respected in Sicily. There were some ways she got a clue of how powerful and/or respected he was. First one is, while we were at a shelter (my father was abusive, and my mother ran with us one time), another lady at the shelter had ties with the underground and started asking people questions. One time, the lady was asking someone questions about my father, and two men in suits walked up to her and said that if she continues asking questions about my father, she... well, let's just say her life was threatened. Another time my mother heard of my father's family was when her friend was watching the news and saw a segment about someone with my father's name (probably his father or grandfather) and they said he was going to prison for having several judges killed off in Sicily. When her friend confronted her about it, she just laughed, shrugged it off, and pretended to know nothing about it, but she indeed knew it had to do with his family.\n\n\nSo, later on, when my mother was pregnant with me (the story with the shelter was after this, of course), while my father was at a club with other guys in the Mafia, some guys that worked for his father came up to him and told him that he found out he's having a grandson and would like to see him eventually. My father told them to tell him that he will never see his grandson and that he will never be in my life. His father tried reaching him again many years later in Florida one day when he was walking down the street with my mother. They were calling his name, which I won't say what our name is here (I too carry the family name), but let's just say it is very unique and the name of an Italian hat company. My mother said he looked back, then looked forward and kept walking. When they got home, he told her that that was his father. My father eventually left the Mafia and the lifestyle, including the majority of his money, the house, the cars, etc. My mom says it's because he didn't want me to grow up around that lifestyle. It may have been for other reasons. I don't know.\n\n\nSo now that you have some back story to my father, here's the reason why I had to tell it. When I was 9 years old, my father went on one of his business trips to New York, which I later found out he was doing a job or two for some people for extra cash. During one of those trips, someone that he used to do business with collaborated with the feds to bust him. He was then imprisoned, and I used to visit him there. The system decided he was to be deported since he was an illegal immigrant, but they couldn't send him back to Italy or Sicily because of his ties with the Mafia. My mother says that he chose to be deported to Peru. He apparently knew some people in Peru. Since then, I've only talked to him a handful of times when I was 9 and 10. For whatever reason, he's decided to live with the natives in the jungle where he contracted a nasty virus and almost died from a fever. My mother said he's always hated people, and would love to live with animals in the wild. Eventually, the calls stopped coming. For whatever reason, he stopped calling.\n\n\n17 years have now passed since then. I'm 26, and my first child, a son, was born 3 and a half months ago. Today I get a friend request on Facebook from someone I do not know at all. We have no mutual friends and she's lives in Peru. I denied the friend request, but felt like I needed to know who she was, and why she would request me. Again, I have a pretty unique Italian name, so she couldn't have simply casually confused me with someone else. So I sent her a message asking who she is. She responds saying,in Spanish (which I know after living in Puerto Rico for 9 years), \"I don't know you, but I am a friend of your father's, [name].\" Completely caught by surprise, yet leery that this might be some scam or something, I asked her how she knows it's my father. She tells me, \"Because he told me you're his son.\" Anyone can say that, right? So knowing that I don't talk much about my father to anyone except those that are closest to me, thus wouldn't play a joke on me about this, I ask her if she knows how many years it's been since I've last seen my father. She responds with, \"17 or 18 years. He has a picture of you when you were little. Similar to one that you have on Facebook.\" Despite it being true that I have a picture of myself when I was about 8 years old on Facebook that I once used as profile picture, and my profile is set to private, I asked her how can I believe her. Her next response made my heart skip a beat. She said, \"The last time you saw him was in a federal prison in New York.\" This is 100% true. This I have not told to anyone. Only my immediate family know about it because they were there. So how could she know this besides my father telling him? \n\n\nFishing for more proof, I asked if she had a picture of him. She tells me that she does not, but that he wants to know how my sister, [name], is doing. Without answering her question, I told her that I need to know whether this is a lie or a joke. Up to this point in my life, I presumed my father was dead. She tells me that he lives in the deepest part of the jungle. He sometimes goes to the city with missionaries to gather resources. I asked her how she knows him, and she said that she met him in Puerto Maldonado, Peru, only a week ago. He saw that she works on the computer, and he showed her a picture of me, the same one that he's had since he was in prison 17 years ago, and asked her, crying, to help him find me. He gave her my full name, as well as my sister's. A lot of conversing took place. I asked her more questions, and she'd answer. She would keep mentioning things that he's told her about us. Things that no one else but me, my sister, my mother, and/or he would know. Things that have never been broadcast on any social networking sight or on the internet altogether. At this point, I am certain that she does indeed know my father. \n\n\nNow the question is, is the way she says she knows my father the TRUTH. I've asked her if she's his daughter, but she said she is not. She did introduce him to her mother, husband, and daughter, however. I've asked her why he stopped calling. She said that he's tried calling hundreds of times, but my mother's family has denied him and said that they know nothing about us. My mother says that this is no way true. The number he used to call hasn't changed for decades. They would have no reason to lie to him about us. My mother is also not the type of person to deny her kids their father, despite how she feels about him. I eventually gave her my phone number for him to call. She says she only wants my and my sister's number. I also got her number. One of the last things she said is that she is leaving the city tomorrow for a week, but she will print out the conversation and tell him the news as soon as she can. \n\n\nThis is worse than waiting a year for half seasons of my favorite shows. My mind will be everywhere for the next week, plus who knows how much longer after that. Do I believe her? Do I believe HIM? Everything she was telling be about the things he would tell her were in such detail. It felt like either he was right next to her, or on the phone with her. I asked her if that was the case, but she kept saying it wasn't. If he's been going to that city that has people on the internet, why wait until now to ask somebody for help? My mother has always said that he's had a sixth sense about things, and probably had a dream about me and/or my son. Has anyone else here been reunited with a family member after almost their entire life? How did you take it? How did you cope? What was the aftermath? What questions would you ask this girl that knows my father? What would you do in my shoes?","from_id":null,"locked":false,"from":null,"retrieved_on":1450827365,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","name":"t3_3j60d3","secure_media_embed":{},"permalink":"/r/offmychest/comments/3j60d3/today_my_father_has_contacted_me_after_17_years/","ups":2,"score":2,"over_18":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3j60d3/today_my_father_has_contacted_me_after_17_years/","link_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"stickied":false,"author":"OMGWHYDOESNTMYNAMEFI","from_kind":null,"downs":0,"num_comments":1,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_text":null,"thumbnail":"self","hide_score":false,"title":"Today my father has contacted me after ~17 years.","is_self":true,"id":"3j60d3","distinguished":null,"domain":"self.offmychest","secure_media":null,"subreddit":"offmychest","media_embed":{},"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":"1441073819","created":1441102619,"edited":1441074371,"media":null}

I went to the funeral and everything went okay. This morning was the burial, and sure as shit, when we pulled out of the funeral home, there sat my father at the red light in his work truck (this is pure coincidence, as he wasn't driving. His boss likes to drive around and talk work so they don't have to be stuck in the office. When bossman is behind the wheel, he goes where he wants, and will not go where my dad wants to go.) It also helps that my dad *didn't* even know I was in town. He doesn't even know that I snuck into his house to get my stuff. He doesn't know what I do and do not have, so he's missing *nothing*. Thankfully, my step dad's truck has dark windows, so he couldn't see me. I don't even know if he even saw my step dad to be honest.\n\nBut, I had a feeling he'd try to talk to me today via text message. He's been trying to talk to me. On one hand, because I'm an introvert who hates being disrespectful to anyone, I feel kinda rude that I always give him short, meaningless answers and lies about what I'm doing. And I'll be honest, he seems to be trying to be better. But I think alot of that has to do with the fact that he's dating some idiot woman who has no idea what kind of man he is (or if she does, then I despise her just as much.) He's been pretending to be the world's greatest dad to impress this woman whom I know nothing about and I don't want to know anything about her.\n\nHe physically abused my mother when I was younger, and when he realized that this would land his dumb ass in jail, he resorted to verbal and psychological abuse to my mother, my sister, and myself. I am 21 years old, and I still cry like a child at the thought of what he's said and done sometimes. I am emotionally traumatized, and I have been considering therapy. What does he think about my considering therapy? Fuck if I know. He glosses over it. Anytime I get angry with him and try to tell him off, he get's all \"What's wrong?\" And when I try to explain to him all the damage he's done to me growing up, he says the following in the most cocky of fashions. \n\n\"Well, that doesn't make sense. What have I done *recently* to make you this angry? Something's upsetting you and I want to know what.*\n\nApparently, I'm not allowed to be pissed about things that happened 15+ years ago. My childhood was fucked and its just not a problem anymore because I'm an adult. \n\nI tried for so long not to hate him. I've included him in almost all of my life choices since he and my mom divorced in November. But  the weight of it all is still pushing me. It took a lucid dream where my subconscious told me that I'm not worthless for me to actually believe it. I was happy when I heard those words, because they come from *me*. My friends and family tell me all the time that I'm not worthless, but its meaningless if you don't know if you don't believe it yourself. In my euphoria, I quit my dead end job, got my drivers license (i know getting it at 21 is considered weird, but hey, i wasn't a very motivated teenager), and I've been dating this amazing girl for a while now. I'm the most happy right now than I've been in many, many years.\n\nAnd in my bliss, I've slowly been phasing my father out of my life. Well, since I discovered how disrespectful he was to my dog's burial instructions (see previous post), I got to thinking. I finally told him two words that I've been wanting to tell him for a long time.\n\nHe messaged me today, and I really didn't want to talk. So, I decided, literally 25 minutes ago, that this is the time for no contact. \n\n\"Piss off\" I told him. Naturally, he was confused and wanted to know what was wrong. I explained to him, for the 1000th time what was wrong. He said he didn't understand. \"What have I done recently?\" \n\nI just said \"Piss off\" again, and ignored the rest of his messages. \n\nI feel damn good right. My girlfriend is also happy with my choice.\n\nSo, fuck you dad. If per some random act of God you manage to read this, while you sit there cofused as to why I hate you for reasons that you can clearly never fathom, I'm going to be having sex with my girlfriend and getting a new job, and eventually buying a car. ALL WITHOUT YOUR FUCKING INFLUENCE.\n\nIf I had a mic, I'd drop it right now.\n\n[EDIT] Side note: He doesn't even know that I'm dating this girl. And he never will if I have anything to say about it. He'll never get the chance to get her to believe his bullshit.","author_flair_text":null,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1450827344,"locked":false,"from":null,"name":"t3_3j61zb","secure_media_embed":{},"subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","ups":17,"permalink":"/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3j61zb/update_since_i_had_to_sneak_in_and_get_my_own/","over_18":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3j61zb/update_since_i_had_to_sneak_in_and_get_my_own/","score":17,"stickied":false,"saved":false,"link_flair_css_class":"","from_kind":null,"author":"HolyOrdersOtaku"}

My name is Marlene Graham. I am 52-years-old, and I live in the Fairview County in New Hampshire. I will not disclose my precise location. I am writing you because I am perplexed with a problem. I will make this web letter brief and prompt; there is something wrong with my fingers. Perhaps the professionals among you will be able to assist me.\n\nIt started two months ago, on a Tuesday afternoon. I had just finished with my scheduled appointments around the town (including a dental visitation and a house call from the quack I see every odd week) and had just lain down for my afternoon nap. I slept for an hour and forty-nine minutes before I awoke, only to find that I was missing a nail on my right hand, index finger. There were no marks and certainly no bodily fluids. It was simply gone with no pomp or circumstance. Now, I have always been a light sleeper, and never fuss about when I sleep. Typically, there is some medication that goes along with being my age, as anyone can imagine; but I assure you that has nothing to do with me missing a fingernail. I merely take pain-relievers and the occasional sleeping medication. Once in my youth, I had a particularly nasty habit when it came to chewing my nails, but never have I chewed them down to the cuticle. That would be ridiculous.\n\nI had never thought myself to dawdle on such frivolous things. However, my knowledge of my own sleeping patterns is entirely sound. The rest of that day was filled with brooding and searching, brooding and searching... It is odd: the loss of a nail. I could not find it on the bed spread, no matter how many times I made and remade my bed. It was not under the bed. It was not around the bed. It was simply gone. I searched until the stretch of sky beyond my small house glowed orange in the wake of the setting sun. I was completely covered in dust and dirt, and had even forgotten to bathe or change out of my gown. I went to sleep that night with a very dazzled mind.  Where had my nail gone?\n\nThe following day I was relieved that I had no other \u201caccidents\u201d during my respite, and life continued as normal. I happened to chance telling a few of the professionals that I worked with. However, with a world full of people all too eager to remind you of your failing age, I will leave it up to you to decide their responses. I dealt with it in kind. I knew there was something more puzzling about my situation, but I elected to give it up and just continue living my life, as was my want. I was just as willing to put the entire problem behind me. \n\nA few weeks later, however, I had the most peculiar dream. \n\nI was lounging on my back porch, enjoying my coffee and old detective novel, when I started getting a sense of something very unsettling. I was halfway to my mouth with the mug when I became very quickly exhausted. The mug felt like lead in my grasp. The feeling became more and more apparent. It was hellish. I felt ill. I dropped my coffee, hearing the thud of the ceramic on the wooden floor. I attempted to stand myself up, carelessly letting the book fall. I could feel the breeze picking up; the clothes I had so recently put up on the line flapping wildly. The strangest thing was the fact that I could not hear it. Any amount of breeze would produce a noise from my wind chimes, let alone the gale that was beginning to whip around my ankles. It all felt outlandish. In as great a dash as I could muster, I made it to the entrance to my home. I struggled with the bum knob for some time, feeling myself grow more helpless with each passing second. The rusty knob made my hand red with the perspiration that began to build up, as I tried, By God, I tried to get that damnable door to yield to me. Something grasped at me from behind, and I cried out, finally flinging the door open and slamming it behind me with the last of my failing strength.\n\nStood in my kitchen, was a dog. \n\nIt was of the Doberman breed. Just sitting there. It was beautiful. It wasn\u2019t panting, it wasn\u2019t moving. Raised up to its full sitting height, ears perked up high. It had a very strange regal quality to it. I noted the floral curtains in the room also curving to the impossibly fast wind, and I could feel it swirling around me in a mad embrace. A voice whispered. Something was wrong with the dog. I remember vomiting, right there and then. I can almost taste it now. Bitter, acidic. The hound began to snarl inaudibly, teeth bore. The weight of myself became too much to bear as I watched the unfamiliar pup. I collapsed, watching the dog bark at me, unmoving. The dog was wrong, all wrong.\n\nI woke up, in a sweat. It had been my most intense and vivid dream since I was a little girl. Unbelievably vivid, even now, I could not and cannot forget it. I remember feeling so relieved that I had regained my grip on reality. I am a sensible woman, not some senile hag. I breathed a breathy sigh of relief. I snapped in my ears, I could hear again, right as rain. But something was off. One of my fingers felt sensitive to the touch. My eyes widened at the sight once more.\n\nI was missing another nail. Right hand, index finger.\n\nSince that horrible nightmare, I have been to a different counselor besides the quack and his inane advice. You would think that a nightmare would not resound with me as much as the one I have described to you did. However, there is not a time in the past month where it has not haunted me in my waken state. I do not know what is wrong with my fingers. I do not know what it is that has made me shed the index finger\u2019s nail on my right hand twice in the past two months. But there is one thought that makes me believe that I may need more help than words or medication can provide.\n\nThe dark stain that resides on my back porch.","from_id":null,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1450827340,"locked":false,"from":null,"archived":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rm4d","secure_media_embed":{},"name":"t3_3j62dj"}

I clean now all.the.time. I'm a stay at home mom with 4 kids so I leave the room for a minute and it's messy. I can't live with the mess. I can't sit down in a messy room. I can't even relax because I know I should be doing something around the house instead. When I think about it more I realize how much stress disorganization causes me. Without meds I would just be stressed with mess and only clean when hyperfocused but on meds I feel hyperfocused all the time on the wrong tasks. I can't even play with my kids in their room for more than 5 minute before I start to tidy it. I just assumed I wasn't good at playing with my kids :( ... I'm constantly hassling my kids to clean but it's never clean enough for me. I hassle my husband for not putting away laundry correctly or my son for putting away dishes wrong. I've always just thought, if you are going to do something do it right. But right is always my way and I'm very anal about that. Is this perfectionism OCD? Or is it ok to want things organized and tidy all the time? I'm getting the feeling nowadays that it's not normal. My husband calls me a perfectionist but I had no idea this could be OCD.

After my post I received hate mail, And on top of that I was banned by Zeach himself on the Agar.io reddit discussions. I Originally though that another moderated had banned me, but I am pretty sure it was Zeach himself that banned me. He banned me for speaking out against the Anti-Team update. He has blocked my original account which was NZJediDavid. Can you believe that Zeach himself just blocked me for sharing my view. I have lost all my respect for Zeach, I though he cared about the valuable players of his game, I have found he is the most ignorant person I have ever come across. So please listen to me Zeach ,I will return. You can keep banning account after account of mine,But I will make sure the truth gets out about who you are and how you treat your players. You treat us like trash and we'll leave your game, How dare you ban me for sharing my views, I am thorough with Agar.io, but my protests and arguments won't stop there, O NO I won't, I will make sure everyone knows the truth. After he had blocked me from the Agar reddit sites I asked, \"Can I please be unblocked\", He replied in his reply \"No, Get Out\".

If you have the time to read what I have to say in the post below, Then please do, but otherwise make sure you check out the conversation I had with the moderators which is the link above. The next time I write a post it will probably be under another nam. As yet again Zeach will probably ban and block this account as well. Thank you for taking the time to read this article.\n\nYour sincerely NZJediDavid, (aka StarwarsjediDavid  - on Gamecentre)\n\n\n\n\n\nNOOOOOOO, Come on Matheus Valadares(creator of agar.io) don't do this. You can't do this. You have destroyed agar.io. Please change it back, I lose mass sooo fast now, You all know what I'm writing about, The change that shocked us ALL. In this article I will be highlighting all the problems of what this new/bad game change has created (The Anti Team on FFA update) and why to change it back to the original version immediately. My background/intro, Names David, I am 15, I live in New Zealand I LoveED agar.io but now I am a very disappointed, dissatisfied, disgraced, and concerned customer. Don't make me have another a anxiety attack Because of this change, I already have enough worries in my life.\n\nI have been playing Agar.io almost every single day since it's release(28th April), My dad plays it all the time, my brother plays 24/7 it my friends play it with me whenever they can. I'll be ringing up my friends every day after school to play agar.io, we both have our Skype going and are playing agar.io hard out, (Which makes me much more sociable, as I'm talking to someone). It is my inspiration to do well at school, My logic is, the quicker I get my work done, the less work that will be set as homework, the less homework I get the more Agar.io time I get. Agar.io has actually improve my grades. So think about how much influence the game has on just my life, It makes me more sociable it helps my grades, it's an inspiration, It brings happiness to my life. Think about it, if that's how much influence it has on JUST ONE person, imagine how much influence it would be having on the thousands of players who play the game. But I have now lost that influence and my life is getting a whole lot harder.\nThis game is so much fun everyone plays it, But if you take away the teaming aspect(By losing Mass Faster) it will be the worse mistake you will make with the game, I Promise you, you will lose thousands of players. The teaming (On FFA) is why I play agar.io (aka for FUN) that why most people play it( it's is only half as fun when your not teamed).If you destroy the fun, you rid yourself of your users, your players, your customers, which are your friends, as any game designer would say. Your players/users are so important, Why would you want to displease them? The reason why Agar.io is getting so popular is because people think it is fun, And it Was UNTIL you changed it so  that (teamed players) loose mass so fast. Think of all those people who team(SOOOO many), why would you ruin there fun for them. If you want to continue the trend of people playing for fun you better listen to what they call fun, not what you call fun. This game is the game I have been playing for the longest I have ever played a game for(I'm sure many other people would say the same), I haven\u2019t lost interest in this game for months Which is really unusual for me, that I have stayed with a game so long(With the exception of Clash Of Clans). The key to this game is that you have kept everyone\u2019s interest, And the second you take away teaming(which creates the happiness) there will be unhappiness, Protest. Think about it, who do you want to keep happy, Do you want to keep the PRO experienced REGULAR players who play daily who love the teams, or a few players who only plays once a month and know nothing about the game and complains because they can't do very well, and they don't like teams(Because the aren\u2019t very good). They don't know the game, it's like the USA asking India weather or not they should take in more Mexican refugees. They just wouldn't do that, because the USA knows that India knows nothing about bringing in Mexican refugees to the USA, New players of Agar.io are like India, You just shouldn't ask them. I know that I would be keeping the regular players of agar.io happy. Another great thing about this game is that it also appeals to adults, And adults, to the best of my knowledge are taught  to work together, You would be surprised how many of the adults team, to get better, Adults love the thought of a game where you work together, Do you realise how rare it is to get a game where ADULTs like to play, Adults will stop playing the game quicker then you can say \"agar.io\". Do NOT loose the adults from the game, the more adults that play the game the more chinwaggeinging there is about the game, which leads to the game being more well known, which leads to more popularity, Never underestimate the power of adults.\nDon't make the mistake you don't have to make, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE listen to those who really matter to your game(The MAJORITY), don't listen to a few players who are inexperienced and want to ruin the game for thousands of others just because they are no good and want it easy. Imagine if everyone lived on the Benefit or Superannuation it just would work, we can't just keep making it easier for ourselves, Don't make others suffer for the actions of a few. Think of what happened when the Coca Cola company decided to changed the flavour of Coca Cola, There was Outrage and a massive backlash, and even when they did Change the flavour back they had already lost many valuable customers, But at least they did change it back when not too many consumers had left/stopped drinking coke, That's what you have to do, change it back As Soon As Possible to minimise lose of players. So please all I ask is that you revert the agar.io mass loss(How much you lose) to what it was. Don\u2019t make the mistake that has already been made by many, Don\u2019t hesitate, Change it back immediately before the loss of players is beyond repair(regainibility). How hard is it to listen to the majority, That's what your meant to do if your a politician. I have always spoken positively about agar.io and would give it a 10 star review, But now I would convince all my friends to stop playing and give it a 1 star review. A solution would be to to use the mass loss change on Experimental instead of FFA, To tell you the truth FFA was perfect as it was, FFA needs nothing new, FFA is fantastic as it is, I would be making no new changes to FFA, leave the changes to Experimental, So LEAVE FFA as it is. But in all reality it is up to you Matheus you can listen to the majority of your valuable players or you can sit there and be Ignorant to the fact that your biggest fans want you to change it back. The choice is in your hands. Don't make the mistake many other companies have made, If you make the mistake of not changing it back/listening to the main regular users of the game, It will be the worse MISTAKE you have EVER made. But I will still thank you and congratulate you for all the fun you have let me have with your game for the last couple of months. That day the 28th of April (Release date) would have been one of my favourite days of my life. I really did enjoy the game, and just to prove that this writing is coming from an Expert check out my many high scores which You can view if you click on the link below. My top high score was 24,692. So RIP agar.io as this will be the end if the line for me and many other regular player unless it is changed back. I hope this article will be guidance to you as I am sure that I represent the views of thousands(certainly at least the majority). I have spent hours working on this article, reading, writing re reading, re writing editing, so I hope it wasn't all for nothing. Thank you for your time reading this article. I hope that the right decision will be made, As there is nothing more that I can do, Except wait in hope and anxiety that the fun will be granted return to agar.io .\n\nThe link below is the link to my photo's in Agar.io which I have uploaded to my website. \nhttp://davidearly.kiluconsulting.org/2015/06/01/agar-io/\n","author_flair_text":null,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"locked":false,"from":null,"retrieved_on":1450827315,"gilded":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"name":"t3_3j6496","subreddit_id":"t5_33fqy","subreddit":"Agar","media_embed":{},"author_flair_css_class":null,"created":1441104357,"created_utc":"1441075557","preview":{"images":[{"resolutions":[{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/odGnGw8HNEZEVXXqwUQ0YG41K5s7qMZqQisXo0UuqpQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=8eb416fedb975c7d8a8a738118ded2c4","height":81,"width":108},{"height":162,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/odGnGw8HNEZEVXXqwUQ0YG41K5s7qMZqQisXo0UuqpQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=9d10a48eb55800b263b028a8ac8e2afe","width":216},{"width":320,"height":240,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/odGnGw8HNEZEVXXqwUQ0YG41K5s7qMZqQisXo0UuqpQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=75d74d9d17e77b1a713ed11e19dea658"},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/odGnGw8HNEZEVXXqwUQ0YG41K5s7qMZqQisXo0UuqpQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=30707461b0a9f7ed4e75aba1cc13cd35","height":480,"width":640},{"width":960,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/odGnGw8HNEZEVXXqwUQ0YG41K5s7qMZqQisXo0UuqpQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=e33c495531d18e51647fbd7cefe66fd3","height":720},{"height":810,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/odGnGw8HNEZEVXXqwUQ0YG41K5s7qMZqQisXo0UuqpQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=39ea807b4b03d77e12811d906f1d844d","width":1080}],"variants":{},"id":"1sXL2j4qJ-u_NaUTqtLesUYESek1NpdrH7aGXhVLLUo","source":{"width":2048,"height":1536,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/odGnGw8HNEZEVXXqwUQ0YG41K5s7qMZqQisXo0UuqpQ.jpg?s=f198b7fdeb29067179733dcd65398f93"}}]},"media":null,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"downs":0,"num_comments":2,"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_text":null,"title":"OMG look what Zeach said to me, ALL MUST READ this if you want to know the truth about Zeach!!","id":"3j6496","is_self":true,"post_hint":"self","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.Agar","distinguished":null,"secure_media":null}

I don't even know what I was thinking or why I left the house. I was very drunk. I normally don't drive even after a *sip* but this time I did. Thank god no one got hurt.  I barely remember it. I remember being handcuffed and that's about it. \n\nI'm so ashamed and embarrassed, and now I owe a ton of money, no license, have to walk or bike 10k to work everyday, everyone is going to ask me about it, my parents are going to be let down, when I am able to get my license back my insurance will be too much too afford. \n\nI feel like my life is over. Like the consequences are too long term and expensive. I barely make it by as it is.  I don't know what to do. I've been thinking about quitting my job, putting all my stuff in storage, and leaving my apartment and just hitch hiking across canada. Something I've always wanted to do but never did due to financial obligations. Now I just don't care. I don't know how to bounce back. \n\nI was depressed and lonely before this but I felt like I was maintaining it well. I hate my job and it makes me miserable every single day. But I was excited at the prospect of going to school next year to become an automtive service technician. Now I'm afraid if I ever leave the job I have, which makes me miserable, I won't be able to get another job. I'm afraid that if I go to school now I won't be able to get a job with this DUI on my record. I feel like I've jumped into a hole that I am not going to be able to get out of. \n\nWhen I would drink, I would have a tendency to get black out drunk. It happens almost everytime. I don't know why I have such a problem not blacking out. I would get very drunk, do some stupid things, get crazy depressed, wake up to an awful hangover. I never liked getting that drunk but I would drink anyways because it's like, so engrained into the social aspects of our culture. I've never had a problem saying no to a drink, but when I would drink, I'd often go overboard. I feel very alone and lost. My support group is minimal. A lot of my friends have moved away. Girls I have loved have left me. It's hard to get out of bed, it's hard to eat. I mustered enough energy to walk to the impoud place to get my phone and house keys out of my car, which was closed by the time I got there. \n\nI guess my first step is to make a commitment to not drinking, but I don't know where else to go after that. Sorry if this was kind of a ramble, or if I broke any rule. \n\nI made a mistake. One I will never make again. Don't know where to go from here. \n\nEdit: Removed a few sentences.

What happened most of the times at our games was everybody would socialize while at the game instead of being their to watch football and that kind of detracted me from the high school events. Anyways while in high school I got along with pretty much everyone, I kept my head down and did not get into trouble got good grades etc. The part I could never grasp though was the socialization outside of school, I wasn't apart of a clique, I just kind of floated around during the day talking to various people, but once the day was over I was at home the majority of the time and never received texts if I wanted to do anything or the such, so point being I was not the most popular person to hang out with. \n\nNow for the part this sub is dedicated to, crush's and what have you. I had a few crush's during my high school years 3 that I remember vividly. Two of them were your typical run of the mill popular girls that everyone liked in high school so I guess I considered them out of my league. The one that I really regret not taking a chance on though was my last, my junior and senior year. She had Blonde hair and was the quiet type not to popular not to socially outcasted, and honestly I think she liked me back but being me I never talked to her and even if she did like me then she gave up and found a boyfriend a couple of months ago during spring break. \n\nSo now we are on to college and I have my eyes on one girl and do not want to miss this chance, so what I have to ask you guys is with my social anxiety and my social extroversion how do I make small talk with this girl or how do I even start talking to her with the uncertainty of how she feels about me.\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: I am socially extroverted and socially anxious, how do I approach a girl I like and not miss another chance at a girl with my minimal experience actually talking to girls?","author_flair_text":null,"media":null,"edited":false,"created":1441105497,"created_utc":"1441076697","author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"relationships","media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.relationships","secure_media":null,"title":"I [18m] single, am tired of missing chances and want to learn how to talk to girls","id":"3j66qy","is_self":true,"hide_score":false,"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_text":"Dating","quarantine":false,"downs":0,"num_comments":3}

Please help. \n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHi all,\n\nA few years ago when I was young and dumb (and seemingly, still am) I took out a 3-4 grand credit card (can't even remember) through GE money and screwed myself over by spending ruthlessly, cash transactions etc. I got it up to about 7-8k from memory. I then tried to 'do the right thing' and asked them to convert it all to a loan so I could pay that off without the temptation of spending anymore so easily with a card.\n\nAnyway fast forward to now (~3-4 years later), I'm paying 100 per week and have been for quite some time and thought it must be low as. I just called them and asked what it was at and they said \"$3,700\" and then told me it's at 30.7% interest!!! I was under the impression that entire time that it was like 17% max. Having done a little reading about finance and actually having an understanding about that stuff now and appreciating how much I am screwing myself over, I nearly crapped myself!\n\nWhat can I do? I'm 23 years old and need to start saving for a house deposit and instead I'm always low on money and paying loans. I have a car loan through my bank, The Greater Building Society, also at like 11% with $15,500 remaining and I tried to re-finance that not long ago to buy out the GE Money loan. They wouldn't let me because I have a few missed payments and they, quote, \"aren't very lenient with things like that\" which I totally understand. The guy I spoke to recommended that I try to get it done through someone more lenient like Commonwealth and they might do like 15% but I blew it off because I was under the impression that GE Money were at like 16-17% on the loan, but they are at 30.7%!!!!! No wonder it's going nowhere...\n\nI am actually scared of the position I'm in.\n\nJust in case this info is also needed:\n\nI'm currently working as a full time trainee, making ~$540 per week and I'm left with about $120 (varies some weeks) after the following:\n\n$70 board\n$100 car loan\n$100 personal oan\n$50 course fees\n$30 petrol\n$25 car insurance\n$20 phone bill\n\nI have screwed up majorly and I need some guidance or even people to tell me I'm an idiot just to motivate me even more to really get something done about it. Before I'm flamed about that motivation comment -- I struggle with motivation and finding reason to do anything due to several mental health issues but I really would like to tackle this whilst I have the courage and motivation to do so instead of avoiding it and pretending it's all okay like I have been.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: They did mention in the phone call earlier today that I can get an obligation free inquiry for adding a minimum of $1,000 onto the loan which will in turn lower the interest rate from 30.7% but that the quote/inquiry will go onto my credit history. I asked what the rate would be lowered to (if it would be something really low and 'normal') and I was told that they can't disclose the newer rate, even just a rough estimate, or if it would be substantial and help my situation, til I've done the inquiry.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n*Update: After some budgeting and talking to my mother, worked out that I can drop $200 a week onto the GE loan and around Christmas time I'll get a $1,600 reimbursement for my course fees which I can use to roll onto the Cert 4 or I can pay it onto my GE loan and resume weekly, interest free payments for my next course. I'll prob use the refund to pay more money onto my loan. I'll have this GE shit out of the way in 4-5 months!*\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Update: I've come up with a plan:**\n\n**1) I've worked out a way to pay $200 per week on the GE money loan and that means it will be paid off in 5 months with only ~$270 interest being accumulated by the time it's paid**\n\n**2) I can then target the car loan with $200-250 per week, and then once I get a pay rise in March 2016 I can rise that figure to $300, possibly $350 per week meaning I should have that loan paid off within 1.5-2 years and it'll only have accumulated ~$1,000 interest**\n\n**3) Once I'm debt free I'll put away $300-350 per week (possibly more as I may have had more pay increases by then) in order to save or a first home deposit. My partner has $30k sitting in an account from her father so if I match that we will have a nice starting fund for a home. I'll even be able to go on a little $3k holiday to Thailand or something with my partner at some point; she always asks me when I can afford to go overseas for a week or two with her :D**\n\n**I know I'm going to have to make huge sacrifices as most of my mates are pub/club beer drinking, gambling kinda guys and I'll be reduced to the odd, very controlled visit (I used to gamble a lot), buying a case of beer to last a month, only going for a cheap meal once every few weeks, not making impulsive clothing, tech gear buys online etc. I'll have to set a really tight budget with almost every penny I make going towards getting myself out of debt, but I know it will be worth it, my girlfriend understands and wants the best for me and luckily I have PC gaming to keep myself occupied.**\n\n**How does this plan sound?**","author_flair_text":null,"from_id":null}

With a common and not so simple context. \n\n*\"Should I continue the college now?\"*\n\nFirst, let me say I find college easy, I don't have any difficulty at it. I'm 17 years old, I live in Quebec, Canada. Here, for those who don't know, high school is only 5 years. After high school, there's \"C\u00c9GEP\", a kind-of-college I guess. After two years there, you can go to the university. In June 2015, I finally achieved high school. My last year there was probably the longest, I was exhausted of school, and in January, when it was time to send my application to my \"C\u00c9GEP\", I really considered taking a year break of school. Working full time during this year, or half of it, and like trael a bit or idk. Anyway. I was supposed to, but finally I decided to go to school, to try it: it's a new school, new scholar's system, new people, classes about something I enjoy (programming), etc. \n\nI started the first semester about two weeks ago (August 18th) and I need to say, as soon as I begun the week, I already felt the: I don't want to be here now. Now is not the time. At first, I said to myself: \"Calm down, maybe it's stress, or maybe it's just because it sucks for everyone to start school after the summer, let it go a while.\" But no, I really don't feel good in this school. And I don't want to be there. My question was should I continue or stop. By writting all this, I can say it clearly; I want to stop. But I don't knwo how to tell it to my parents. They already knew I didn't want to start \"C\u00c9GEP\" for now, but they were SO happy and grateful that I changed my decision, that they offered me as a birthday + christmas a new laptop (Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro), pretty expensive, and because I needed a good laptop for my program in school. I know the best thing for me right now is to drop out for half a year, or for a year, I just need that. I know I will return to school without problem, I always loved school before... I'm just exhausted, I want new things to happen. But I don't know how to announce it to my parents, mostly because they just fuck*** paid me a brand new laptop, you know. I can pay them the school fees, that's not a problem, but not really the laptop... or maybe. I don't know. \n\nThat's also the thing: I'm really stuck financially. I made a huge mistake by quitting my job at Best Buy, I loved it, I don't know what happen to decide to quit, anyway, I have my phone's plan to pay, and I need to pay my phone's balance (I don't know if in U.S you have this, it's a kind of short term contract by paying gradually the phone value), I owe cash to a friend, and to my parents, anyway, for real I know there's worse out here, but I'm really stuck, and it's only stressing me. Just found a new job at a restaurant as a server, but I work only two shifts (Friday and Saturday nights). I need more than that. I really need a car also, I need to save for it. We're like 8 in my family, with new babies, I also want to go on my own as soon as possible, anywayyyyy so much things, who needs money. I feel like school isn't my top priority right now, even if I know education is one of the most important thing. But I'm not motivated, I will pay to be in class half of the time, and not putting the efforts for having good grades, etc? That's not working. \n\nAnyway, I'm really sorry for this long post, but I want some advices about what should I do, what could I do to tell my parents ?\n\n**TL;DR --&gt; I want to drop out of school for now, taking a break, but I don't know how to tell it wisely to my parents.** ","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjdm","name":"t3_3j675k","secure_media_embed":{},"locked":false,"retrieved_on":1450827278,"from":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"score":1,"over_18":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3j675k/how_to_tell_my_parents_i_want_to_drop_out_of/","permalink":"/r/Advice/comments/3j675k/how_to_tell_my_parents_i_want_to_drop_out_of/","ups":1,"from_kind":null,"author":"SherlokH","link_flair_css_class":"job","saved":false,"stickied":false}

I'm nervous because many of the students and teachers adore jazz and it will be a big part of the course; but I could never stick to it. I always felt a little bad about that, because my drum teacher I had for five years is a pretty prominent jazz drummer here in Ireland, and lives and breathes it; he did his college thesis on Max Roach for god's sake, so the fact I couldn't get into it made me feel awful. \n\nThat's not the only reason I want to get better, of course, but it has been on my mind. I recently just have an urge to finally put my head down and stay dedicated, but honestly rock and general heavier styles are so ingrained in me that I don't know if I could even get moderately proficient at it any time in the next year or so. Whenever I try to play **trad grip**, I just.... can't. It just doesn't work. I don't know why. I'm the same with **finger technique**. I've tried all the drumeo exercises, everything, but my hand still insists on playing the fast, swung ride patters with the wrist, and it sounds awful and robotic. It's the same whenever I do any shuffle (particularly something like the Purdie shuffle. I know it's not really jazz but it's the finger technique). It's honestly infuriating and makes me feel like I have no soul as a player (that sounds very dramatic but I mean more feel and stuff), and that I'm just a brainless rock guy. I want to learn and I want to be able to do these things naturally. Whenever I see one of my drummer friends post a video of them playing even the simplest jazz pattern, and their wrist is working so beautifully and naturally with their fingers to produce that clean, satisfying swung ride pattern, I honestly feel terrible because I can't do it, despite my best efforts. \n\nSorry to get so rambly. Basically, I just want to know if, based on what I've said there, I should dedicated my time to learning all these things. I most definitely want to learn, and want to get good at jazz drumming, but at the same time it could take a very, very long time; time that could be used to further my current strengths and become my own player in that realm. \n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n**I'm currently at a very basic level of jazz drumming, but I really, really want to get better. Should I dedicate myself to learning jazz (and potentially spend a huge chunk of practice time in the coming months or years doing so) at the possible expense of furthering my current strengths?**\n\n**Finger technique and traditional grip still, after trying quite a lot, feel very unnatural and as if I'll just never be able to do it because using matched grip and just my wrists is so heavily ingrained in my brain. How can I finally learn? Can I learn, will it actually work after all this time?**","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"from_kind":null,"author":"queensinthesky","permalink":"/r/drums/comments/3j6ab3/ive_been_drumming_for_6_years_playing_mostly_more/","ups":3,"over_18":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/3j6ab3/ive_been_drumming_for_6_years_playing_mostly_more/","score":3}

The title was: *\"In high school, I was jealous of the girls who only dated college guys. Then I got into college and saw the guys who only dated high school girls.\"*  What followed was a contest to demonize male sexuality of epic proportions!  Now let me make something absolutely clear.  **I don't advocate sleeping with anyone under the age of 18.  No matter the circumstances.** Not even if the local age of consent is lower then 18 years old.  There are just too many legal complications that can arise.  It's not worth it.  But to say that two consenting adults choosing to have a sexual or emotional relationship is *\"creepy\"* reeks of jealousy and insecurity.  I've picked out a few choice comments for your viewing pleasure:\n\n&gt;There were two freshman in my dorm, who had some sort of scientific process for this. I think they'd been hot-stuff football players at their high school that was about 25 miles away, but at college were just stoners. Every weekend they'd bring two new girls on their \"date\" which always involved hanging in their dorm room until a sock went over the knob, and one of them took his date into the neighboring dorm room. Their high school must have been huge...\n\n&gt;I don't know how they recruited their dates (as this was before email and cell phones, and rooms did not have their own phone), but they borrowed a car from one their moms every Friday night like clockwork to go pick up their new \"dates\".\n\n&gt;It was intensely creepy.\n\nYes using your social standing to invite women over to bang; instead of paying for their dinner only to get a peck on the cheek in return *\"intensely creepy\"*.  Those sexist dudebros should have taken a divorced 40 year old post wall ham planet out on the town instead!!!  They better not expect anything in exchange for buying her steak and lobster either!  The writer doesn't say whether the women they would bring back were 18.  But it's entirely possible they were 18 year old high school seniors.  \n\n&gt;I also recall two extremely attractive freshman girls who were dating older married men. One was dating at 37 year old, and one a 42 year old. At the time, i thought it was slightly sad. Now that I am a married 40 year old, this is beyond disturbing.\n\nBanging hot 18 year old women instead of the same fat old hags every night is *\"beyond disturbing\"*  Someone's jelly!\n\n&gt;I'm a 27 year old married male, and somehow I don't understand the allure of much younger women. They're too young, too inexperienced and too... different. Like there wouldn't be anything in common.  ...I didn't only mean conversation. Of course I understand sex is supposed to be fun with younger women. And, ceteris paribus younger women are less experienced, which I don't find fun.\n\nBehold the male hamster!  He didn't settle for a used up old slut who's been plowed by a million other men.  He enjoys *\"experienced women\"*.  No really guys... he's happy that his wife's pussy looks like a claymore went off in it.  Otherwise having sex with her wouldn't be fun.  It's not like he's lying to himself to sooth his trampled ego!\n\n\n&gt;Any 37 year old male \"dating\" a teenager hasn't likely mentally grown out of his own teens yet.  If my wife invited a 20 year old into our bed with us, I wouldn't turn it down, but I wouldn't want to converse with the girl afterwards either, hahahah.\n\nSo any man that would rather be with smoking hot 18-23 year olds is juvenile.  But if he had a chance to score one he'd be all over it!  How does that make sense again?  Also it doesn't matter of a woman is 18, 28, or 38; if I want to have intelligent conversation I'll talk to a man.  It's not that I think all women are dumb; but I hit on women because they're attractive and I want to bang them.  Not because of their extensive knowledge of Chaucer. \n\n\n\n&gt;As a 25 year old man, I see nothing disturbing about it. When I'm 42, I hope I'll be in a position to bang willing 20 year old women. In her twenties, she's an adult and more attractive than most 40 something year old women. Assuming she is taking care of herself. Why wouldn't an older guy want that???\n\nFinally some honesty.\n\n\n&gt;Seems to work both ways, girls like older guys, and guys like younger girls?  That's my observation.\n\nMore honesty.  \n\nWhy are other people so concerned with what consenting adults choose to do in the privacy of their own homes?  Unless they have an ulterior motive.  Young beta's with low SMV's want less competition for top shelf pussy, and aging women with low SMV's want less competition for the most desirable men.  \n\nMen value different traits in their partners then women do. I guarantee you if a 50 year old CEO could bag a hot 18 year old college girl without worrying about ruining his personal/professional life because of divorce or scandal he would, and many do. See: Bill Clinton, Elliot Spitzer, Anothy Weiner, Mark Sanford, Jack Nicholson, George Clooney, Donald Trump, Alex Rodriguez, and many more. \n\nIt all makes sense when you take into consideration how men and women coevolved. Men are attracted to youth, beauty, and nurturing. Young women are the most likely to deliver healthy children, beauty is highly correlated with health and good genetics, finally a nurturing mother is going to do a much better job keeping a man's offspring alive while he's off hunting.\n\nWomen evolved to seek out alpha men that can provide and protect.  Both for them and their offspring.  Men could either do this directly with their bodies [explaining women's attraction to men with big muscles], by using their social skills and social standing to rally other men to do their dirty work for them [explaining women's attraction to social standing and dark triad traits], or they could pay other men to fight/hunt in their stead [explaining women's attraction to wealth].\n\nBut there are fragile egos, and radical ideologies at stake.  So we can't let a little thing like scientific evidence get in the way.\n\nLessons learned:  \n\n* Men age like wine (up to a point); Women age like milk.\n\n* Hamsters gonna hamster.\n","author_flair_text":null}

I am 19 years old, first experienced depression and self harm at age 11 or 12. I have always had high expectations placed on me as the eldest sibling. Steadily my depression grew worse and developed into a double whammy of both depression and anxiety. I don't know what reason there is behind it all, my father would sometimes hit me as a child but I always feel that as it wasn't as severe as other people's abuse, it's more something I'm clinging to out of some form of weakness. My depression has gotten worse steadily growing into occasional suicidal thoughts until at roughly age 17 or so I was first put on lexapro which didn't last and made me feel suicidal, I have also been on prozac twice and seen 3 different counsellors. I hate the idea of putting outside blame for my personal issues but I feel my symptoms were exacerbated by my then boyfriend who could not deal with my clinginess and emotional dependence and would frequently call me a plethora of not so flattering names. While with this boyfriend I began dabbling with alcohol and drugs. Beginning with weed and then developing to a more occasional lsd then ecstasy/mdma. Since the break up with aforementioned ex in late 2013 I have been experiencing a gradual decline in my state of mind. This was very inconvenient as I was approaching my school leaving exams and applications to college. My lack of motivation continuously narrowed down my future prospects, from ambitions to be a scientist, I had to settle for computer scientist until I ended up choosing art as I no longer could sustain the grades. Don't get me wrong, art is my passion but I can never shake the fear that I will never find employment and therefore never have a solid future. I entered college in my second choice course which was graphics design and quickly realised it didn't suit me. February of this year and I had a breakdown, I missed 2 or 3 weeks worth of classes which put me irreparably behind. I started taking prozac again but found I was having suicidal thoughts multiple times daily. I continued prozac until my emotions were deadened altogether. A week before the end of my first year I dropped out and-excuse my eloquence- single handedly shat up my future. I applies again for my dream course (illustration) and got rejected for my second time. This Thursday I have another interview where I will inevitably not get accepted due to my skill and waste another year of my already unremarkable life. I've been bursting in to tears at random, my hands are constantly trembling, I do not sleep until ungodly hours, my friends are impressed if I manage to eat a single meal a day. I stopped taking prozac a month ago and at first felt I was faring well but the decline started up again very quickly. I have no hope for the future, I feel like a waste of air and resources and that my family deserves someone who supports and makes them proud instead of a useless mess who hardly leaves her room. Yet at the same time I always feel like I'm over dramatic or something, that I should feel so lucky and grateful for all the things I have and that I have no reason to feel this way. I don't know what to do with myself anymore and all i feel that I can do is smoke and drink until I'm numb and hope a car hits me hard enough to at least give me brain damage. My friends are dwindling and the few I have left must be sick to death of my whining and already have problems of their own.\nI apologise for the long post and if you have read this far I sincerely thank you for listening to my rambles.","author_flair_text":null,"from_kind":null,"author":"Solaerys","link_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"stickied":false,"score":2,"over_18":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3j6ec9/i_have_no_title_i_just_want_to_let_things_off_my/","ups":2,"permalink":"/r/depression/comments/3j6ec9/i_have_no_title_i_just_want_to_let_things_off_my/","distinguished":null,"domain":"self.depression","secure_media":null,"is_self":true,"id":"3j6ec9","title":"I have no title, I just want to let things off my chest and hope someone out there understands.","hide_score":false,"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_text":null,"quarantine":false,"downs":0,"num_comments":0,"media":null,"edited":false,"created":1441109198,"created_utc":"1441080398","author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"depression","media_embed":{}}

I am 29 years old, going on 30. I got a tech school degree out of high school, but no job. I have an decently ok job now, making like 24k a year, which I realize isn't really worth a shit. I like the work environment enough. I work with an assortment of women. Which is kind of funny in its own right. You would think working in that environment would make me less jaded, but when you know to watch what women do and not what they say, shit starts to become clear. Two of the hotter women are marrying men of higher status. One of the guys is even 10 years older than she is, so he kinda bagged himself a hottie. The other woman who has probably already hit the wall because she was trying to successful ended up marrying I swear the first guy who had a steady job to come along. And the saddest one is this really attractive girl who recently had a kid, and her husband lost his job. He is now trying to scrounge together a living by baking pastries (I'm not kidding), and I imagine she is trying to buy into the feminist propaganda and support them both. Her hugs get a little closer and tighter each day I see her. Plus every time I see him, he is always such a damn ass kisser. I know he sees me as a threat. \n\nAnyway, all that to say I am thinking about switching jobs. I doubt my pay will ever go much higher than it is here, so I want to change jobs. I have this dream of owning my own house at some point in the future, with a big screen tv and a sexy car. I'm not married, but every little hottie wants a piece, and just can't nail me down. My plan to get this dream started is to go to school learning to drive trucks cross country. I kinda want to get out of my home town and see what is at the very least out in the United States, and just make a bunch of money trying to travel around a bit.
