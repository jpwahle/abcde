Please bear with me as this post will be very long and possibly not make much sense or even come across as contradictory, but I feel like I need some things explaining to myself, since right now I'm genuinely really confused. Also fair warning I'll be talking about sex, masturbation, porn, etc. But yeah I guess long story short is I need help in determining what exactly is going on? Am I just a regular straight man, an asexual hetero romantic, demi sexual, gray ace, or what? I'm also probably going to say the same things twice, and then realise I wanted to say something and then forget to do so. Like I said, bear with me.\n\nI'm not really sure where to begin or how to structure this. I'm not even sure where, when, or how I first found out about asexuality. Maybe at one point someone mentioned it to me, or maybe I was bored and reading wikipedia. But in any case it makes sense, someone who does not experience sexual attraction. But then you wonder well okay but what exactly is sexual attraction? So you start reading about it and think hmm maybe this applies to me, and so you read further and then think, hang on maybe not. Or yeah but what about XYZ and then the doubts escalate and you just get so confused.\n\nI'll say it now. I'm 24 years old and am a virgin. For reasons I won't disclose here, I've come close to having sex, but never actually had proper sex. But I'm definitely attracted to women in some way. Sexually, sensually, aesthetically, romantically or platonically, I'm not sure which I am or am not. I identify as a straight man, but I could well be asexual.\n\nI find women pretty or attractive (here in context, not the best word choice perhaps), and am now wondering what am I attracted to? I like the idea of spending time with them, being near them, holding them, cuddling them, sleeping in the same bed, even seeing each other naked. To me, that's sensual and romantic. My ideal partner would be my best friend and a loyal, loving companion.\n\nBut I'm not sure how I feel sexually. Because I've never had sex, I don't know how it compares to masturbation. Sure, I've watched plenty of porn and I know what's involved but at the same time, at least in my mind, sex doesn't seem that much different than masturbation, and whilst I have a sex drive or a libido, I seem complacent to simply satisfy that with some porn and masturbation. So I feel I have a healthy sex drive at least.\n\nBut, I don't know how to describe it. I find vaginas weird. I love pretty female faces, long hair, boobs, butts, and feminine features, but vaginas are really weird.\n\nI don't remember much from sexual education. I remember it being stuff like the penis goes into the vagina, or how to put a condom onto a practice dildo, but weirdly and possibly like a lot of people, sadly I feel I've learned a lot about sex through porn.\n\nNow obviously porn is highly unrealistic, I know that. I mean more in terms of anatomy, positioning etc. But still, vaginas are weird. I'll quite happily masturbate to some boobs or something but pubic hair on a woman or close ups of a vagina turn me off so to speak. As does anything to do with anal sex, even though I find butts sexy. Like I said, confusing.\n\nMy love life is non existent. I've never been in a long term relationship ever, and I only started thinking about getting into a relationship when I was about 20 or 21. I've used online dating apps since in my mind it would be far easier and simpler than actually talking to a random girl I've never met before and somehow asking them on a date. But then, I'm shy, introverted, and really not photogenic. There are very few photos of myself I like and I hate getting my picture taken. So it's not going to go well right from the start.\n\nFor all that though, there was a girl whom I really liked at the time, and we actually met up at her room in university. I spent 2 nights with her, and we slept together. Now, colloquially that would mean sex. I did bring condoms with me, as even though this was the first time I'd met her in person, I wanted to be prepared. But we didn't have sex, in fact (and I think I was pretty stupid at the time, I'm still unsure why I did this), but we actually never saw each other naked, as when getting ready for bed I got changed in her bathroom instead. Did I want to see her naked? Yes, probably. She had a really pretty face, and was so cute and slightly chubby, cuddling her was amazing. I did really like this girl, but at the same time I was complacent with just cuddling and being near her, that it didn't bother me we didn't have sex. We did kiss, or try to, but this was the only time I've ever kissed a girl and I actually said to her that I don't think I like it, but she was like that's ok, not everyone does. I don't know if she was just being nice and thought I was weird or what. But I never actually saw her again after that weekend sadly. I think I was in love with her, but looking back I probably shouldn't have been, even though I at the time wanted to be around her all the time.\n\nThere was another girl who I was speaking to for about 3 months, who sadly cut me out of her life before we ever got a chance to meet in person. She actually at the time identified as asexual. I don't recall what I asked her about it or found out from her about it, but again I very quickly found myself in love with her and we talked all the time.\n\nSo I definitely experience strong sensual and aesthetic and romantic attraction. But at the same time, do I experience sexual attraction? Like I said, if I see someone I find attractive, I wanna talk to them, be with them, hold them, and be their best friend, but I don't know how I feel regarding sex as I've never had it. It's like how I might like a certain type of food, but I've never had it. I know what's in it and it sounds tasty, but until I try it I can't be certain.\n\nSex does not repulse me, even though like I said I find vaginas weird, but so long as I can masturbate and satisfy my libido, I think I'm good. But the thought of dying a virgin doesn't bother me as much as the thought of dying alone. I desire that companionship far more than the sex itself.\n\nI haven't found anyone since then, nor have I been in love, and that was 3 years ago now. A lot of the time I've kind of given up. Either because of frustration of not getting matches from dating apps, or just not desiring a relationship. Like I said, I'm shy, introverted, and not photogenic. Most of the time I come across as either a grumpy old man or something to that extent.\n\nMaybe I'm asexual, maybe I'm demi, maybe I'm just a regular straight man, or a hopeless romantic. I'm not sure, but hopefully this post was somewhat interesting if you've read all of it, and I'll be happy to answer any questions, and I might think of more things to say. This was a long post, so I've probably forgotten stuff.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"asexuality","subreddit_id":"t5_2qv0q","subreddit_subscribers":122641,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Questioning my life, and asexuality??","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asexuality\/comments\/gb7hi2\/questioning_my_life_and_asexuality\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

This heavily impacts my life.  I see a lot of posts on here talking about how Islam took your childhood\/high school\/ college years away. It breaks my heart knowing so many people have had to go through this experience that I have and am currently facing. I have religious muslim parents who are immigrants from Pakistan while I was born and raised in America. I am talking about this from a (20F) perspective, so I am sure many women (or men) that are holder probably face more pressures. Nonetheless, I will give you some back story abut why marriage is so pushed on me despite this younger age. My sister is 6-7 years older than me and is still not married and my parents have tried shoving countless arranged marriage opportunities in her face but they're pretty much given up on. Thus, they shift their attention to me.\n\nMy parents tried arranging me with my cousin from Pakistan (first cousin-my dad's sister's son). I am obviously 10000000000% opposed to this, and I was very young at the time (16-18 years old). They never apologized for it nor acting like what they did was wrong. I felt so degraded and worthless for so long. I ended up moving onto college, but I had to commute to a local college and live at home. I feel like missing 4 years of the college experience slowed me down so much. The reason I feel this way is because I will not be able to experience living alone until I am (21 at the LEAST). Thus, I would want from 21-24\/25 to live on my own, get higher education, and enjoy experiences that I missed out on in college.\n\nI just recently got out of 4ish year relationship (it's complicated we still text, but I do not think we are going to get married like we planned). I basically confessed to him how I am not muslim. He was way more religious than me like WAY more, and it made me realize that I cannot end up with someone like that again. I know I am still young, but he also made me feel like I missed out on so much (it was a wonderful relationship but it had its flaws). I did not have any guy friends for the last few years for him. I made other sacrifices in terms of what I wanted to do, but I am not going to get into it.\n\n***The combination of having no college experience (living on your own experience away from parents), an attempt at an arranged marriage, and leaving a 4 year relationship makes me not want to get married until I am 26-28. I would want to date (eventually) , but I am not going to get married. I have no opposition to marriage, but I know your life completely changes after it. I do not want to enter that without being ready.***\n\n**I need your HELP : How do I cope with all of this? I know my parents will be upset that I am also marrying later like my sister, and I do not want to go through that with them. I am already stalling marriage by planning on going to law school, so please suggest other things on how to stall. How do I mitigate their being sad?  What can I do that will make them realize my independence is more important than being married?**\n\n**TL; DR - I missed out on a lot of life experiences due my parents\/islam. I could not live on a college campus, just left a 4 year relationship , and I was arranged at some point for marriage.  I do not want to get married anytime soon, but I know my parents do not want this. Any advice helps (from a male and female perspective too).**","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"exmuslim","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7k2","subreddit_subscribers":90674,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"The pressure of marriage so young while Islam and your parents have both taken away YEARS of your life FUCKS me UP","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.77,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/exmuslim\/comments\/gb7ill\/the_pressure_of_marriage_so_young_while_islam_and\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I\u2019ve kissed girls and been intimate with one but I\u2019ve never been in a relationship with another girl. Throughout my life I\u2019ve been with a handful of men, mostly because it\u2019s easier. Women don\u2019t approach me, but men do. Every time my relationship with a man ends I would tell myself \u201cThis time I\u2019m going to go for a woman so I know if I like girls for certain\u201d\n\nRecently the urge to be with a girl has been overwhelming. It always happens in every relationship I\u2019m in. Things are going ok until I start thinking I might settle down with this guy without experiencing what dating a woman is like. I want to know. I believe we only get this one life and I don\u2019t want to die not knowing.\n\nI\u2019ve neverreally been attracted to males solely on their physical features up until my current boyfriend, which is why I\u2019m confused. Guys approach me first and their personality pulls me in. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever made the first move on a guy. Older guys seem to be the only exception to my otherwise non attraction to men. My partner is 29 and I am 22. \n\nI notice attractive women whether I\u2019m in a relationship or not. They\u2019re everywhere! How could I not? Men are kind of just there and I don\u2019t look twice at them.\n\nI\u2019ve never had an orgasm, with myself or with a male partner. Before my current partner I would kind of just zone out and think about other things or how I\u2019m waiting it to be over. I didn\u2019t get the hype around sex and I\u2019m still not sure I fully understand it.\n\nI\u2019ve tried bringing this up to my boyfriend, and I\u2019ve felt invalidated from his responses.

He\u2019s said things like \u201cI\u2019m only doing this to have an excuse to be promiscuous\u201d among other things. He believes I\u2019m going through some sort of phase and he\u2019s told me it\u2019s normal for younger people to want to experiment. It\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s not just to sleep with people. I want to know who I am. I know some bi people know that they are without ever having to take any physical action but I\u2019m starting to think it could be more than being bi. Maybe I\u2019m just trying to hard to put labels on things. \n\nI\u2019m just concerned this is a grass is greener situation and I\u2019m going to ruin a perfectly good relationship because I\u2019m curious","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"latebloomerlesbians","subreddit_id":"t5_mwfyw","subreddit_subscribers":58718,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"What if I lose a good relationship because I might be having a phase?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/latebloomerlesbians\/comments\/gb7k1j\/what_if_i_lose_a_good_relationship_because_i\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

Unfortunately, I live in a state where, even though I am 18, the age of legal adulthood is actually 19. Meaning it is extremely difficult\/impossible for me to go to a clinic and get prescribed birth control without my parents; I called my local PP, and it was going to cost $150 without insurance for a consultation before I could even be prescribed any birth control. I do not want to use insurance. I have heard that there are ways to keep it confidential, but I am not willing to take that risk. If they found out, there would be hell to pay.\n\nI have recently become sexually active and I really, REALLY need hormonal birth control. We are safe and ALWAYS use condoms as well as spermicide, but I know these methods are not foolproof and I would feel 1000% better if I could be on BC as well.\n\nAll this to say, I have been doing my research and considering online BC providers such as Pill Club, for example. I have read articles and studies and it seems to be completely safe and much more affordable (I work part time and would be able to cover the costs for this much more easily.) \n\nHowever, I cannot shake the feeling of it not being legitimate. It seems like a really complicated medication to be able to just... get online? Therefore, I have been very hesitant to go through with it. This would not be a long term solution, and I would likely be able to get on more permanent birth control once I can get on my own insurance in a few months once I move out.

Job descriptions to follow.\n\n**TEST SUBJECT**\n\n* Test subjects must be able to spend long hours in tests without well defined completion times.\n* Test subjects may be restrained to ensure the test proceeds uninterrupted\n* Test subjects must accept that any sexual activity could occur during testing as this will increase the purity of results\n* The application of pain and pleasure will increase the purity of the results\n* Test subjects may be humiliated during testing\n* Test subjects may be degraded during testing\n* Test subjects may be treated as objects during testing\n* After testing, subjects will be held for observation, cuddled, called \"good girl\", and may have their mouth probed by a tongue.\n\n**ASSISTANT**\n\n* Assistant will be asked to observe testing procedures and take notes\n* Assistant will be responsible for the maintenance of all superior's needs and desires\n* Assistant will be used sexually in a \"free use\" style\n* Assistant must be able to type a minimum of 100 wpm while providing fellatio and receiving cunnilingus\n\n**ABOUT MAD SCIENTIST**\n\nThe direct supervisor of any successful applicant was born and raised in Vancouver area of BC, in the tiny and often overlooked nation of Canada. After completing a rudimentary education in the third-world public education system, he went on to research many projects for the betterment of humanity.\n\nHe had a successful marriage until he was separated from the ungrateful bitch over what she called \"your mean and sadistic view of the world and you didn't buy the milk like I told you to\".\n\nHe focused on his science and increased his understanding in Chemistry, Physics, and Biology. However, every new invention was ridiculed by his peers, and one even caused a legal investigation where he swears he thought she was 19.\n\nAfter pleading guilty to gain a lesser sentence from the useless \"justice system\", he has now come to understand the truth of the world lies in the Patriarchal Misogyny beliefs that he discovered in prison.\n\nCurrently, he is working on **BIG PLANS** to cure all known viruses, but addict the world to the substance so that they must all serve him as his slaves.\n\nHe wants **TEST SUBJECTS** and an **ASSISTANT** to help him achieve these goals.\n\n===============================\n\nIf you got this far through this, thank you for reading. This was an amusing post to write.\n\nEssentially, I enjoy being in a Dominant role that includes CNC, bondage, free use, and cuddling with a masochistic girl. I have a thing for younger girls, but, no one under 18 because I do not want to go to prison for the reasons that my above persona did. I'm 40, by the way. Trans-girls are welcome, but, must be already living full time as a girl, but pre-op is fine.\n\nAnyone interested should contact me by DM.

I've been highly sensitive as long as I can remember and it's been a wild ride. I've made friendships that will never falter because of my ability to empathize and be truly close and open with people, but of course there have been some that have been immensely toxic and short lived because of how I react to certain actions or traits. \nEvery little thing that embarrasses me or forces me to face my insecurities makes me want to end my life. I've been suicidal since middle school and I'm 26 now, still constantly struggling with what feels like an inability to stop verbally telling myself that I want to shoot myself in the head or stab myself in the throat till I can't move anymore. \nKeeping a job or making friends feels entirely impossible since I just cant find the right way to push those thoughts and feelings away. I'm honestly a very positive and fun person to be around when I'm in my healthy state, but the things that haunt me when just the smallest stuff goes wrong just isn't okay and I feel like it will eventually get the better of me. \nI've tried counseling and medicine, but haven't had a therapist long enough to keep things feeling decent and no medicine ever does what I need it to. That being said, I cant really go back to either because I don't make enough money for a therapist, meds and rent\/other important things especially when I cant hold a job down in Dallas. \nI just don't know what to do anymore. I hate myself so much and can't keep living like this. The things I used to love to do are beginning to dull out and feel meaningless and trying to learn anything just makes things harder because I don't want to be bad at it at first. I know you have to practice something to get better, but the disappointment of failing makes me fall back into my hole. \nI know being sensitive can be a gift, especially when helping others that you can empathize with, but it isn't doing anything but harm to my sense of self and well being in the long run. \nThis isn't me saying I'm going to commit suicide,  as I tend to find reasons to keep going everytime. I'm just scared and feel hopeless most of the time and don't know what will push me over. \nSo sorry for the waste of time here, I just needed to say something.

Well I don't hate my younger brother but mom and dad...they have been self centered narcissists as long as I can remember.  They are shallow.  They only like talking about everyone's achievements or how much money they have or spend or what vacation they took or what fancy job they have or how someone's gifted in school or who's getting married or who's having a baby.  Tonight for example... earlier I was the only one helping my mom by lugging all the groceries in the house and handing them to her one by one so she could wipe them off.  I also cleared the sink out and took care of dishes from breakfast and lunch.  I also refilled all the beverages in the fridge and restocked the coffee pods.  Then it's dinner time and no one says a damn thing to me (kinda the usual) but my mom has to be the loudmouth center of attention...she goes on about her best friends daughter - they're moving into their new house soon, yeah they got it, I think they sold their old house too $700,000 house.  Then goes on about the granddaughter that she has always fawned over, talking about how she's picking out her room color (NEVER could I do that) and how she's in a gifted school. (My mom was advised when I was very young to put me in gifted programs, but I got the worst public education and they were never supportive or encouraging about my schooling).  So we're eating dinner and she says to him \"chicken's good isn't it\"  nothing to me.  Then at the end she tells him all sweetly, I got you a special ice cream... again nothing to me.  Whatever, I'm used to it...then I go to do the dishes and clean the kitchen, cuz that's apparently my job, and as I'm emptying the dishwasher I accidentally hit a plate with a plastic container.  My mom yells from the living room, HEY! I said it was an accident.  She storms over and just takes over the task...I fucking can't stand these assholes.  We're in lockdown together and it's survival everyday for me.  Sometimes I lay in bed when I wake up and just feel like, oh god another fucking day...and it takes a lot to make myself get up. Oh and last night my mom took an Ambien and was acting all stupid and weird which she does when she takes it and proclaimed, I want a cocktail! (She almost never drinks and shames me for drinking even though I never get drunk or act weird like she does on Ambien) well I offered to make her one...after she sipped it down and dad and bro went to bed I asked \"did you take an Ambien?\" Cuz she was being weird.  She said yeah, I took the last one because SOMEONE STOLE THEM ALL, she asked if it was me. I was like no I would never do that, plus I have my own sleeping pills.  So of course that leaves my brother.  I know it was him bc he's spent almost every night the past month looking for them cuz she would hide them, but of course I'm not gonna rat out my brother...but it's obviously him.  She doesn't get mad at him or nothing, if it was me she would freak the fuck out and probably turn me in.  BTW I'm 40, my brother's 32.  Yeah I sound like a bitchy teenager, but that's exactly what it feels like being back home with them.  FML I can't wait to get out of here and I wonder if I'll ever talk to them again.\nThanks for listening, lol.\n\nTL;DR  adult children back home with nparents during quarantine...driving me crazy.

You can be living your life, enjoying yourself, having a good boyfriend, friends, in college and having a lovely housemate. But it still comes back. You're lying in bed, on your back staring at the ceiling. It materialises. Telling you things, you're a bad person, attention seeker, liar.\nI want to say I was abused once, it was hurtful horrible and I think that maybe it was the beginning of my long string of failed relationships, feeling disgusting, then liberated and nasty. But then you're thinking about it again, you think about it so much that you start to believe it never happened or that you just lied so you could get attention. I tell everyone. But nothing makes me feel better. Once I met him, I had fun with him and tried to reassure myself he was a better person, it was a young mistake. Still haunts me though.\n\nI'm still in love with my ex who wants nothing to do with me. I idolised him, I dream about it. I'm trying to get over someone but I cannot let him go. Every time I go online i want to message him, but I see that he still hasn't read my text over 6 months ago. I will always mean nothing. I'm so obsessed and I want to slit my wrists, drink until I can't think and smoke until my mind's too foggy to comprehend.\n\nI think I love the pain. I think I am only in love with feeling like shit because it's what I know when its associated with love. Someone who calls you ugly but says after \"but I still love you\" is easier to hear than I love you with genuine meaning. \n\nI feel as though people are sick of me, soon the time bomb will end and my friends will realise how much of an attention seeking boring bastard I am and just fuck off around me. I feel when I talk about my problems they sigh and just wished I never messaged or wished I'd bother someone else. I'd wish I was locked away so someone could take care of me because it feels like I'm drowning on my own. I'm self harming again, I'm 21 and I am self harming again. I haven't done it since I was 15.

(I'm 5' 11.5\", if anyone wonders).\n\nSo as you can see, my height was kind of abnormal during puberty, which lead to a slightly tilted self-image of mine during my pre-teen years. \nI thought I was mentally and physically more develloped than my peers, so I adapted behaviours and mentalities, which are seen as typical for late teens and young adults. (I didn't do drugs, tho.) I also became more interested in sexual topics without much shame on my side.\n\nI was usually rated 2-4 years older than I really was, when someone rated me. When they found out about my actual age, they couldn't believe me in almost all cases.\n\nI also want to point out, that I found out about porn at age 10 and I also started masturbating then. It became a regular (daily) thing a year later at age 11. Two years ago until now, I decided to slow down my masturbation habits for personal reasons.\n\nThe age where I found out about sex is at 8 years, because of some older friends and rather than feeling disgust like normal kids, I felt releaved because it definitely explained some internal feelings, that I had. I also fantasized about fingering a girl at around the same age before I found out about intercourse WITHOUT someone EVER telling me about fingering before. Weird, right?\n\nI don't know if my very young outlook on sexuality impacted my current fetishes, because I like thicker girls, who are as tall as me or slightly taller. And I worry this may cause some problems later in adulthood, because the general societal expectations for couples are the opposite. Also I prefer my partners to be like up to 5 years older than me, because they aren't as shy in bed. I feel ashamed to say that, but I feel like shorter girls are less sexually arousing to me. \n\nWhen I was 13-14, my sex drive was at an all time high to the point, where I would easily consider fucking 70% of women, that I met on the street, almost predatory behaviour when I look back at it.\n\nNow, at 16 I observed my sexual thoughts to slow down a bit and to be a bit moderate. I don't overdo sexual thoughts like a drug anymore (\u00bfinvoluntarily?), but I view sex as a usual activity. I kinda don't see it as a personal dopamine kick anymore, but more like a bond to another person. I don't even fucking know why my outlook on sex changed, it just did. I don't even feel sexually adventurous anymore, I internally feel like my adventurous time is in the past already.\n\nBesides that, I feel like on an emotional level and intimate level, I would have been ready for sex at age 12 (of course at 12 with another 12 year old) without any complications.\n\nWhen people say it is far from normal to have sex at age 13 with a peer, it kind of infuriates me, because I know what I've lived through and how I felt. It makes me feel like a presexualized mutant, who doesn't fit into society.\n\n\nThank you for reading this through, it took me so much courage to list those things. I don't want you to feel uncomfortable or to encourage pre-teens to things they don't want yet, unlike I wanted. I just want to let you know, that people like me exist.\nDo you think my experience is normal, can anyone relate?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"sex","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3p","subreddit_subscribers":1881466,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I [M\/16] think I might have been ready to have sex at age 12","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.31,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/sex\/comments\/gb869a\/i_m16_think_i_might_have_been_ready_to_have_sex\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Within the past few weeks, especially being out of work due to the Corona virus, I've realized how detrimental living with her is to my mental health. She hasn't been a helicopter parent, I'm allowed to go out as I please, but she does control our finances and we share a bank account. When I told her I want my own account she started to get upset and exclaim that I'd be responsible for paying certain bills and paying half of our rent.

He had been taking me to the doctors appointments and he would lie to them telling them we were just hanging out.

They don\u2019t want you to have a gf because they want you to make a career first and then get serious with someone.\u201d\n\nHe then tells me that I should not care what his family thinks of us and that it shouldn\u2019t matter.

When my father was done, he got up to drink a cup of coffee as he always does after Iftar. I don't really talk with him to be honest, I'm polite and repsectful towards him, but I have absolutely no feelings whatsoever. He could die and I don't think I'd care. But anyways, back to my mom.

And she told me \"So, you still don't believe in Allah?\" and I told her no, obvi! She then told me \"You know that if you die tomorrow, you'll go to hell, right?\" and I responded \"Hell doesn't exist, mom.\" and she just went silent for the rest of the dinner. About 30 minutes ago, as I was in my room, I heard whispers and sobs next to my room, which is the bathroom. My mom was crying, I'm 99.9% sure it was because of that. My father was here and I heard both of them say my name, so I'm sure they were talking about me. I don't know if she told him, he probably would\u2019ve smashed my door.

For what? Lol.

I get into arguments with my parents almost daily about whether or not my lifestyle and plan is sustainable. I currently net about $6,000 per month in online e-commerce however I can't seem to get past that cap. Every day I run 1.5-2 miles to this spot where I manifest my future, and I believe it will work as it gives me peace of mind and something to look forward to. I recently invested about 35% of my savings into cryptocurrency as I am predicting a large rise in the coming months, I guess you could say I have a lot going on at 16 I'm failing school and that bothers my parents as my mother is an education professional, and that is one of the reasons we have arguments almost daily, because I would rather be developing a website or scaling products VIA facebook ads than do school work. I listen to Robert Kiyosaki and Ben Mallah a lot because I love the idea of getting into real estate, and when I am 18 I 100% will as soon as I can. So if you made it to the end I'll pop the question lmao am I doing this right? I know that is a hard question to answer but I want desire this life of financial freedom and its straining my relationship with my loved ones. I feel like they just do not understand and never will break out of the cycle of being middle class as they have a poor mindset.

Is there even a consensus?\n\n**Do you diversify your penny stock portfolio or gamble on one or two at a time?**  I get the sense that the more experienced folks are invested in 5 or more penny stocks at a time.  I find this intimidating and potentially inaccurate.\n\n**How do you find your stock picks?**  If you get your tips from other people's tips, what is their source?  How do I go about finding a winner before everyone else does?  I've been late to the party more than I'd like to admit.\n\n**How can you identify a pump and dump situation?**  And how do you avoid getting burned by one?  Or better yet, take advantage of it? \n\n**What is the influence of algorithmic trading bots or large financial institutions in the penny stocks arena?** I am unclear on their role in the market, and if I should even care.\n\nThat's it for now.

She's coming off a pretty recent 8-year relationship so she's pretty new to the dating scene (and she's told me countless times that she doesn't know what's okay\/not okay when it comes to dating). Me and her matched after about a week of her officially creating her profile and we hit it off right away. Everything was perfect! I'm telling you, for a month straight we were talking almost every hour of every day and our conversations were never boring. We talked a lot about what we would do and where we would go on our first date, but unfortunately we didn't know when that would be because I'm in NY and she's in NJ. \n\nShe left me on read Sunday night and she didn't text me all morning Monday so I knew something was up. But her grandfather recently died from coronavirus so I gave her space and didn't think of it too much till Wednesday. Wednesday morning I text her asking if her if everything was good and it's then that she tells me that she thinks I'm great, but that she decided to get serious with another guy and she didn't know how to tell me. Shellshocked. I contemplated blocking her, but I didn't. After a few hours of thinking it over I ask her straight up why she lead me on for a MONTH and why I didn't even get a chance to take her on a date? She tells me she was talking to both of us and that she was going to give me a chance, but she didn't want things to get deeper and deeper between us when she felt she had already made up her mind . Important to know that she has also never met this other guy either. She was super honest with me which I liked, but FUCK it hurt me and I let her know and she apologized. And I understand it's totally okay to talk to two people at once, but I can't even get a chance to take her out? After a whole month of talking every day? That just hurts.\n\nSo I'm asking y'all, if things don't work out between her and this guy, should I be okay with being a rebound? I told her straight up that if it didn't work out that I'd be there and she said she would let me know for sure. If this was a random girl that I was talking to for a few days or whatever I wouldn't care, but it felt SO MUCH different with me and her (even if I hadn't met her yet). And she said she really liked me (but she also must have really liked this other guy). I have experience with dating apps so it's not the end of the world for me, but man... what would y'all do? And also, am I terrible for hoping that her first date with this other guy ends up being terrible? HAHA. Also, either way I'm gonna lay off dating apps for awhile so I don't really want to go through the talking stage with other girls.

But I feel like my daughter is a jerk to others as well, like her friends and her boyfriend, and I will lay out the reasons why.\n\nMy daughter is a jerk to me because:\n\n* She doesn't want to get a job to help with college even though we encouraged it way before the pandemic.\n* She has to be reminded to do all her chores and clean her room even though she gets allowance if she completes these chores. (Her chores are cleaning her room, feeding the animals &amp; doing the dishes, if it matters.)\n* She acts like you are asking her to amputate a limb everytime you ask her to do something that is on her predetermined list of chores. Sighing, eyerolling, slamming doors, stomping, etc.\n* She is messy and treats the house like her own personal pigsty. Whenever you ask her to, god forbid, use a plate to avoid getting crumbs all over the place, she reacts as above. I am constantly cleaning up after her.\n* She doesn't care one iota about personal hygiene. We have to remind her to shower and brush her teeth. Her reaction to us reminding her is the same as above. I think the last time I remember her caring about appearance she was about 10 or 12.\n\nMy daughter is a jerk to others because:\n\n* She never ever says thank you for anything. Her best friend went to Israel last year and brought back presents for her, and I watched them interact for about 10 minutes, with the friend chatting away about her trip and my daughter opening the presents. Finally I couldn't take it anymore and said 'Aren't you going to say thank you for the gifts?' She ended up not caring about the presents at all because she left them on the couch and they then fell on the floor and my husband stepped on them the next day. We put them away in a cabinet and she hasn't asked about them since.\n* She doesn't try to get to know her friends on a personal level, like at all. I constantly ask her the most basic of questions about her friends and boyfriend, just trying to show interest, and she never knows the answer to anything. She didn't know where her best friend decided to go to college at. Her boyfriend moved two hours away to live with his dad when school closed due to the pandemic, she didn't know why. She didn't even know where he moved. Her school decided to do a virtual graduation and film all the kids receiving diplomas, I asked if her boyfriend would come back and do this. Response: I don't know, I didn't ask, it doesn't matter. All she cares about is anime, Pokemon, Markiplier and various other video games and shows. That's all she wants to talk about. Whenever her friends come over I basically have to force her to allow them to play video games with her, otherwise they'd just be watching her play. She doesn't even offer. \n* She doesn't respond in kind to ANYTHING. She pays forward NOTHING. Her boyfriend, since he moved, has written her like 6 letters. Who does that these days? Puts pen to paper and writes a personal letter and mails it! I thought it was very sweet. I asked if she was going to write him back. Response: No, anything I want to tell him I can text him. She acted like him writing her was a huge pain because 'the letters were too long.' Whenever holidays or birthdays are coming up we have to remind her to get a present for her friends\/boyfriend. \n\nYour kneejerk reaction to this might be to say that she is depressed. I get it. Who isn't depressed a little at this moment in time? I'm struggling myself. But she's been like this since puberty. She seems content other than dealing with me. She has a social life. She enjoys her various hobbies. She seems to have a great time chatting on discord every night. I don't think depression is the biggest factor here. I kind of think she's just a jerk. My husband mostly deals with her these days because she despises me and makes it known repeatedly. After the virtual graduation discussion she said I'm a 'nightmare to talk to' and stomped off.\n\nWhich brings me to: I'm not exactly sure where I went wrong. I've clearly failed somewhere. I'm not a perfect parent, far from it. I'm not religious but I was raised on the golden rule: treat others how you would want to be treated. I thought I raised her with the same value but evidently not. \n\nI don't know what to do. My gut tells me to just send her to college and hope that reality slaps her in the face. Something like her roommate telling her she smells and shouldn't she shower once in a while? I kind of wonder if she just doesn't want to do these things because *I* want her to. If I weren't around she might be different. Is this normal teenager behaviour? Is this a generational thing? Gen Z versus Millennial thing?\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nTLDR: My daughter's a jerk to everyone and I don't think it's related to depression and I don't know what to do about it.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjdm","subreddit_subscribers":545967,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My 18 year old daughter is a jerk, is it too late to do anything about it?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/gb926u\/my_18_year_old_daughter_is_a_jerk_is_it_too_late\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

We both downloaded TikTok at the same time and I noticed that my \u201cfor you\u201d page was filled with memes and currently internet trends,  and his was more, you know, 29 year old man humor.  \n\nA good amount of \u201csexy comedy\u201d in there (you know what I mean right?) anyways I just wrote that off as wow tiktoks algorithm is very good, at least it really showed me content that I like.  \n\nI wasn\u2019t mad at that.  But then slowly his for you page was just FILLED with butts, half naked girls, (probably underage ) and sexual challenges.  It disgusts me.  And everytime I bring it up he denies.  But there\u2019s no fooling me.  \n\nI know he doesn\u2019t get on it often, so best case scenario, he was just horny one day and watched a bunch of sexual videos that got him off, and closed and and never really looked at it again,  Hence all of the videos and algorithm.  \n\nI don\u2019t think this is break up worthy but it just rubs me the wrong way.  ESPECIALLY the fact that it was mostly underage girls doing these sexual challenges.  Like what girl over 18 would be like oh I\u2019ll do a challenge on Tiktok where I flash on the screen myself in my underwear for 2 seconds ? Like common,  that\u2019s a thing horny middle and high schoolers do.  \n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s looking at those and goes yes I\u2019m looking at underage girls.  I don\u2019t even think the thought came to his mind.  He was just horny. And now I feel like I\u2019m defending a pedo.  Ugh it just really bothers me.  He deleted it, which is a relief cause it just disgusts me honestly. \n\nAny thoughts? Condolences? Help? Anyone going through the same shit? (doubt it lol)\n\nEDIT: I think some of y\u2019all are taking this the wrong way.  Simply put: there are certain types of guys who\u2019s feed looks like what my boyfriends does and certain types of guys who\u2019s feed looks like what mine does.

Like I said up top, I'm 23yo and recently graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor's in molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. I currently work at a hospital in a clinical laboratory. As nice as this place may be, I would much rather transition into the field of software development and\/or software engineering as the pay is more lucrative (current pay sucks) and the subject matter is far more interesting in my opinion. \n\n**My current situation:**\nI am working full time 40hrs\/week at my job and am doing so primarily to pay off some debt that I have from school (~$10k). I live with my parents\/family at home so I don't really have much rent or utilities to pay for outside of maybe a few hundred a month. I don't do much to further my career or dive into something new, partly because I'm exhausted once I get off of work and like to wind down and hang out. And partly because I'm a bit lazy tbh and lack discipline if I don't have a clear direction.\n\n**What I want:**\nMy end goal is to land a job in the CS field that pays well (&gt;$60k? idk exactly) and will help me build the foundation of my career. \n\nI was looking at way to reach this goal and saw options for coding bootcamps, master's programs, bachelor's programs, certification courses, etc. I don't know which of these are the best and most likely to help me break into this field, and which are most likely to be a dead end and a detriment to my wallet.\n\nIf you guys could help me give advice\/find resources in order to set on this path, I would be eternally grateful and would love to post a success story someday if\/when this all comes to pass.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"cscareerquestions","subreddit_id":"t5_2sdpm","subreddit_subscribers":534758,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I am a recent graduate and have a Bachelor's in a science (not CS related).

Started PT right away after the injury and my Pt place is staying open during COVID so I go 2x\/week. I am progressing really well, was off the crutches within 2 weeks, have full extension and most of the flexion back. Now to my question:\n\n- I\u2019ve never done PT before so I have no idea how this stuff works. The place I go doesn\u2019t really have a lot of equipment as far as I can tell. The sessions are 40 min long. I do the exact same exercises every single time I go (I also do those same exercises at home 2x day). \n\n- I am going into week 5 of PT. Is it normal to do the same stuff all the time? Basically the only changes are stepping on a foam to make balancing harder.\n\n- the exercises that I\u2019ve been doing are: straight leg raises, inside and outside thigh raise, star touches, calf raises, tandem walk, side steps, clamshells, hamstring curls and leg lifts.\n\n-is this more or less your experience with PT too? I get super bored of doing the same stuff over and over again. Is it going to get harder soon? \n\nThank you all!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ACL","subreddit_id":"t5_2qo48","subreddit_subscribers":9518,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Is my PT bad?

So, I have not actually seen a neurologist, but I assume I have BFS, coupled with some pretty bad health anxiety.\n\n\n\nI assume I have BFS because I am 25 with no family history of *** or associated illnesses. So I understand the chances of having it are unlikely at best. But I get muscle twitches in both thighs, feet, calves, hands, stomach and base of my throat on occassion. Some weeks I get em all over like this, other weeks I get em mainly in one limb.\n\n\n\nThe reason I haven't visited a neuro is because of my health anxiety. I am actively trying to address it. I saw my GP for whatever ailment on average probably a couple times every month or two last year, so it was getting out of hand. And with health anxiety, when we seek medical dpecialists, we are really just feeding the anxiety, even if it makes us feel better temporarily.\n\n\n\nSo with that said, the twitching alone wouldn't really bother me. But my left arm is a bit off. I get aches and pains in my elbow and bicep. But most notably, I feel weakness and clumsiness in my hand. Grip seems to be fine, but the hand tires quickly, for example when typing or playing Xbox. It doesn't stop me from doing those things, but I notice it. I understand thay clinica weakness really is the inability to do basic things like button a shirt or hold a mug, but I am still nervous. \n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that I have had these symptoms sibce September\/October 2019 - so 6-7 months. The twitching has been constant, with some quieter periods and is usually only when I am seated or laying down. The hand weakness comes and goes for a few weeks at a time.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone else get these symptoms? The only thing that helps me calm down a bit is that it does come and go. It might feel like this for a couple weeks, then I will forget about it for a couple weeks, then it will return.\n\n\n\nThanks.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BFS","subreddit_id":"t5_2tlhk","subreddit_subscribers":2250,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Weakness and clumsiness in hand?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BFS\/comments\/gb9gkr\/weakness_and_clumsiness_in_hand\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I sometime have trouble going to sleep because my mind keeps racing. In the past, masturbating usually helped put me to sleep. So when I can't sleep, I feel really tempted to masturbate. Last night, I took a Benadryl and Melatonin and eventually went to sleep, but I'd like to avoid those scenarios the best I can. Any advice?\n\nToday was good though. I stayed busy with work, practiced chess, and did a few hundred calf raises. That said, I made two mistakes.\n\nFirst, I was feeling lonely this afternoon because I miss seeing my crush, G. I spent probably 30 minutes looking through her social media, but that made me feel even lonelier, which is bad because loneliness is a big trigger for me. I shouldn't put myself in that situation so easily.\n\n&gt;Action: Tomorrow, I'll install StayFocusd on my browser and limit social media sites to 5 minutes per day.\n\nSecond, I felt some urges and had an erection, but I don't think I shut that down like I should have. I basically just kept working and eventually everything passed. But maybe I should have explicitly said no and redirected my attention to something else (e.g., pushups, a run) for a while. As time goes on, I think I'll need to be more intentional in those moments.\n\n&gt;Action: When you feel urges in the future, vocally resolve not to relapse or even entertain those thoughts, and then consciously redirect your focus to something else (physical, spiritual, or social).\n\nBesides that, it was a good day. The weather is glorious and I'm 5 days PMO-free. Looking forward to hiking with some friends this weekend. Will they notice a difference in me? We'll find out soon enough.\n\nHere's to no-PMO for 90 days and to a better life. 5 down, 85 to go.
