It was out of the blue. I was fresh off of a loveless relationship that ended smoothly and left no baggage behind. This man and I connected quickly. There were immediate sparks. We took the first few dates at a steady pace. Within the first month and a half we met on a weekly basis. We would text often and he called often just to chat. However, once we started having sex the meetings became more frequent. \n\nFast forward to about 5 weeks into this affair. One night after we had had unprotected sex, I felt it necessary to ask what his thought was on the current status of our relationship. He quickly proceeded to ask me what I defined a relationship as. Look, I am 30, I am not into \"hanging out\" anymore, so I was honest with him. To me a relationship is monogamy, commitment, and yes, there is a title involved. He asked if we could be monogamous without the title. This kind of took me by surprise. I think I would have almost preferred he said that we should just stop having unprotected sex and continue to hang while figuring things out. However, in an effort to be the cool girl, I said fine and sucked up my pride. \n\nWe are now 2 months in. We have planned a 10 day vacation in January, I have met some of his friends (introduced to them as a friend), and in response, I have tried to start to heat things up. I bought lingerie for when I saw him this past weekend, etc, etc. Unfortunately, has gone in the opposite direction. He showed up at my place that morning with coffee.. just for him. When he comes by at night he always has an excuse for why he didn't bring something (wine, etc.), but I have seen him go out of his way to grab something when we visit a friend's house. Dates are now meetings that are no longer planned in advance. I'll give an example. Last weekend, we were both in the same city with different groups of friends. He texted me towards the end of the night and asked to meet up after our nights began to wind down. Now, keep in mind that he did spend the night and the next day with me. But, formal plans such as dates and dinners, movies and whatnot do not happen. Also, quick important side note, last night when we were moving to book our travel dates for our January vacation he out of nowhere asked if we could bring friends along. I agreed, I know, you guys can fault me for this. But, I didn't want to seem needy or too intense. What he has not stopped are the compliments, the public affection, or the constant communication. But, I am beginning to feel like I am back in college or that I am in a relationship. It's all just too comfortable for him. \n\nWe still have fun. The sex is great, the conversations intense, and I do miss him when he is not around. However, this nagging \"you deserve more\" internal voice keeps screaming at me. My male friends have mentioned that I am a \"kept woman\". This seems extreme, but I have to question what I am really getting out of this. It's been a short period of time, yes, but should I feel this way this early on? Or, am I completely reading into the situation?\n\nEdit: if someone could kind of map out what would have been a normal timeline in this than that would be helpful. Sorry, I think I just need like an eye opener.\n\ntldr: guy seems a bit too casual too early on, is label averse, yet still shows bounds of affection","thumbnail":"self","link_flair_css_class":"m-yw dating","downs":0,"secure_media":null,"archived":false,"media":null,"link_flair_text":"Dating","ups":3,"edited":1477961444,"id":"5ag1zp","spoiler":false}

{"score":12,"author_flair_css_class":null,"selftext":"Hey! I'm new here. My name's Julian, I'm 22, and I'm a recovering heroin addict. I wanted to preface this by introducing myself and by saying that this isn't a phony attempt to cover up my own wrongdoings. This is, in all honesty, for a friend. I have my own shit that I'm dealing with, but his situation is beyond me.\n\nMy friend is a 22 year old dude who I met in rehab. He lives about two hours away from me, and we became friends because we checked in to rehab around the same time (November, 2015) and went through detox together. Anyways, he was doing really well for a while. It was really cool to have a friend to speak to about stuff that I've kept a secret for my entire adolescent/young adult life. Unfortunately, about 6 months ago, he picked up his horrible methamphetamine problem right where he left off before he entered rehab.\n\nHe ended up getting arrested for a misdemeanor (not entirely sure what the charges were) and spent a few days in jail before being bonded out by his parents. The dude convinced his dad to let him go to a suboxone clinic, where he receives enough suboxone 8mg strips and klonopins to sustain an 8mg/day suboxone + 4mg klonopin habit. He was delusional; he convinced his father and his own self that this was the only way to refrain from methamphetamine use.\n\nAnyways, fast forward a few more months to today: I got a message from him saying \"yo I drove all the way to this detox center but they only detox for benzos and/or alcohol,\" which makes sense to me because those substances bless those who consume them with scary and very lethal WD's. He begins insisting that he go somewhere that also detoxes for opiates...which I believe, well, would be weird since they would likely give him subutex to wean off the suboxone...but that's silly. I'm trying to convince him to just taper off the suboxone.\n\nIn fact, I'm trying to convince him to taper off the benzos too, since he's been taking 4mg of klonopin a day (maybe occasionally taking a little more or a little less) and most detox programs, to my knowledge, usually provide services for 5-10 days. Furthermore, I've read that klonopin withdrawals can last longer than the WD's left behind by more fast acting benzos, such as alprazolam or lorazepam. I'm trying to convince him that the process would be smoother for him if he refills his script and tapers himself off of of them.\n\nThen, to add insult to injury, he tells me that he has plenty of suboxone strips to taper himself off of the buprenorphine; however, he only has 4mg of klonopin remaining, presumably four of the 1mg tablets. He continues on to tell me that he cannot (maybe will not? Idk) pay the $400 cash necessary to see somebody with a medical degree at the suboxone clinic. Before I continue, I want to now digress and say that I really appreciate all of you who read my novella and who have arrived at this point in my post. ALL OF THAT BEING SAID, there are a few things I want to ask this community on his behalf:\n\n1.  What, in your opinion, would be his best option? Should he really, reaaaally try and get the $400 from, perhaps, his parents, so that he can visit the clinic and get his scripts refilled, allowing him the opportunity to do a sort of self-taper?\n\n2. Assuming he is able to get his hands on his usual month supply of both buprenorphine and clonazepam, how should he go about tapering? Should he slowly decrease by .5mg or by 1mg? How many days should he take his first decreased dose, followed by his additional decreased doses?\n\n3. This one is more of a personal question I, myself, would like to ask: Should I just stay out of it? The dude was always there for me, but he has also been a continuous reminder of the horrible habits that tortured me prior to my journey through rehab and (almost) one year of sobriety?\n\nI would appreciate any/all input. Thank you, and best wishes!\n\n\nEdit: \n\nTl;dr: my friend needs some advice on how he should go about tapering off his daily medicine regiment of 4mg klonopin/8mg buprenorphine, as he insists that this helps him refrain from methamphetamine use. This is not a cop out to disguise bad habits of my own; I am dealing with my own shit with the help of a therapist and familial support.","saved":false,"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media":null,"archived":false,"media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"ups":12,"edited":1477961398,"id":"5ag2pt","spoiler":false,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh7l","domain":"self.Drugs","hide_score":false,"title":"My friend needs help","contest_mode":false,"permalink":"/r/Drugs/comments/5ag2pt/my_friend_needs_help/","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/5ag2pt/my_friend_needs_help/","secure_media_embed":{},"num_comments":7,"quarantine":false,"gilded":0,"locked":false,"name":"t3_5ag2pt","over_18":false,"subreddit":"Drugs","media_embed":{},"author":"rudecommunist","author_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"retrieved_on":1484188511,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1477959517}

I\u2019m not really sure if the incidents that follow count as glitches or just me being strange.  After reading some glitch in the matrix accounts/stories, I\u2019m still unclear on the concrete criteria for glitches.  Just tell me if these are definitely not glitches and I\u2019ll delete the post.  \n\nEdit:  This edit is to address some concerns some of you have had.  I apologize again for having written the original post quickly and left several things unclear.  I call them \"slips\" and daydreams because they are quite brief while I'm awake, not long enough to even notice a time difference.  They are a \"slip in focus\" as opposed to a \"slip in consciousness\".  I assume the \"slip\" is me losing focus, which is why they do not last long because I realize I'm not paying attention.  When there are images and not just a feeling, it is definitely just like a superimposed image over what I'm currently seeing.  It doesn't obscure anything.  The incident in the car that I mentioned is the only car slip.  \nAs to the idea of it being a past life, sure, I have no idea, I posted this to get feedback.  As I've mentioned, I have seen myself a few times and I look like me.  I've also looked at others and the way they're dressed and assumed it was modern because of that.  This was also edited in haste, so if I've missed something, tell me in the comments.  Also, I suggest reading the comments because I do explain a few things and there aren't that many to sift through.  \n\nTo start, I\u2019d like to say that I am 25, single (never married), and I don\u2019t have any children.  I am significantly older in some of these worlds, at least a decade in most of them.  In the ones that I can see myself, the ones when I\u2019m at home and have a mirror or window access, I even look a little different; older, different hairstyles that I never even considered, heavier, pregnant, etc.  \n\nFor about a year, I\u2019ve been having these ridiculously realistic daydreams and dreams followed by intense feelings of emptiness or like something important is missing.  The feeling of missing something has been physical and emotional.  Here are a few of moments I\u2019ve had.  \n\n1.  I was driving in my car, fully awake, when I kind of felt a \u201cslip\u201d and I looked in my rearview mirror and saw a car seat, a little girl, hockey equipment in the car with me.  I also realized that I was in a completely different vehicle, had a ring on hand, and different hair.  In the \u201cdream\u201d, my hair was still relaxed, but shorter than I\u2019ve ever worn it.  I went natural a couple of months after this \u201cdream\u201d.    \n\n2.  This one was one of the earliest and I just assumed it was a vivid dream.  It left me confused for days because it felt so real.  In it, I was walking around a house that feels familiar, but can\u2019t remember ever being in such a house.  There were pictures of my (that version of me) family around the house.  There was a solo picture of my husband and a man\u2019s wedding ring in a box on the dresser.  A fairly recent dream revealed my husband was some type of law enforcement and died on duty.  The most recent encounter is what encouraged me to write this.  \n*I think I\u2019m most connected to this reality.  No idea why, but I\u2019ve had the most encounters with it. \n\n3.  Same reality with dead husband.  Fully awake moment and I was driving in my car when I heard my own voice say \u201che\u2019s gone\u201d, but I didn\u2019t move my lips.  I also had no reason to say that because I was listening to the Sleeping Beauty soundtrack.  I started crying, which further freaked me out.  My ring finger felt naked and it felt like more people should be in the car with me after the slip.  None of my close family members or friends are recently deceased (last death was over a decade ago).  *I'll note now that I didn't see anything in this one and the crying wasn't sobbing, just a few tears that surprised me.  \n\n4.  I\u2019m assuming this reality is the same as the first one, or at least very similar.  I\u2019m at a child\u2019s hockey game with a little girl, probably 3 years of age in my lap.  Her older brother, maybe 10, is playing and I\u2019m surrounded by other parents.  This was the first and only time I\u2019ve seen the older child in one of these.  \n\nThose were just a few, but I\u2019ve had more than I can count of just normal, everyday moments (for the other versions).  Sorry they\u2019re not very detailed and sound fragmented, I wrote these down during study breaks.  Thanks for reading and for any feedback.\n\nEdit:  If you're going to be an jerk, your feedback really isn't helpful.  I'm pretty sure daydreaming doesn't make someone psychotic.

I used to LOVE Halloween.. at least, I loved the planning of a costume, going trick-or-treating.. getting to be out after dark, playing make believe, getting candy (seriously.. who would dislike getting candy?)\n\nbut I've always had this problem with anxiety. I called it 'being shy' back in the day.. I hated knocking on doors, I got 'performance anxiety' with figuring out what I was supposed to say, when I should say it, and so on. All these strangers doors...\n\nThen at some point, one mean adult ruined Halloween for me, by snidely remarking that I was too old. After that, I stayed home, alone.\n\nI wasn't a popular kid, never really got invited to parties or anything.. and being an only child with parents that worked during the day, I was often sitting at home alone as the sun set, and the youngest Trick-or-treaters started traversing the neighborhood with their parents.\n\nThey'd ring the doorbell, and I'd freeze up. My parents expected me to get on the 'giving out candy' bandwagon.. but I started freaking out. Usually my Mom would come home relatively early, and then once she was home, I was free to just hide in the livingroom.\n\nFor a while, I was involved in some Star Trek clubs (RL) and we usually had a little get-together, so I often found someplace else to be. Then shortly after, I moved to a little town in Oregon.\n\nUp here, it rains a lot. And so the trick-or-treaters aren't too common. In fact, there have been years where we've bought candy, only to have no one even knock... but still, I've hidden in my room, or gone to a friend's house to avoid the door responsibility.\n\nAnd still, my heart jumps into my throat when the doorbell rings.\n\nThis year, I've moved in with the friend-I-used-to-go-over-to's-house.. so there's noplace for me to go and hide.\n\nHe's bought candy. He's decorated our little apartment window. He's essentially hung out a sign saying 'free candy, just knock'.\n\nAnd he won't be home til nearly 8pm.\n\nNow, it's true.. we're in an apartment complex.. but there ARE kids living here. with only a 15-30% chance of rain.. there's bound to be a few brave souls at least knocking on the decorated doors.\n\nAnd I'm home.. alone.\n\nI'm 43 years old, and I'm DEEPLY afraid of some little kid in a plastic mask knocking on the door.\n\nAll I have to do is turn the knob, say \"oh my gosh, it's iron man!\" and hand them a couple pieces of candy, then wish them well on their crime fighting...\n\nYet I'm still scared.","saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":157,"media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"secure_media":null,"archived":false,"downs":0,"edited":false,"ups":157,"spoiler":false,"id":"5ag9kv","subreddit_id":"t5_2qmij","distinguished":null,"title":"I'm 43 years old...

{"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_css_class":null,"selftext":"I didn't enjoy what I was doing and I just did not get the material no matter how much I studied. I wanted to become an engineer, but I guess it wasn't in the cards for me. What sucks of all this is that I passed differential equations and previous Math courses while studying 4 to 8 hours everyday and getting As and Bs(Funny thing is that I'm two courses away from a minor), but I just couldn't hang with the Engineering courses. I also had trouble with Physics. What a waste. I'm essentially dropping the major and going for my backup plan if I had failed engineering, which was accounting. I was thinking of CIS, but from the research that I have done, CS and Engineers get the jobs or those jobs get outsourced. \n\nAnyway, I am 28 years old and by the time I get a bachelor's degree I'll be 30/31 years old. My question is that is there a \"You're ___ old? Get out.\" in the accounting world? This is really the final straw that I can grab in my college endeavor. I don't want to go through getting the degree only to realize that I cannot get a job because of age. I do not care about getting a job with the \"big 4\" companies. I'm fine just working in a cubicle doing accounting work at a small company. \n\nFurthermore, I was thinking of graduate school as a maybe down the road, but I am not sure if it would be worth it. Does anyone know? I'm not rich and the cost would be pretty significant, so would graduate school open up more job opportunities to counter those significant costs? I currently have a overall GPA of 3.67. Of course, I haven't done any major courses, so the GPA could go down or up depending on how I would do in those courses. I'm not sure what the GPA cutoff for graduate school is, but I do not aspire to get into harvard or UCLA. I'm fine with a middle tier university in California.","saved":false,"score":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"secure_media":null,"archived":false,"downs":0,"edited":false,"ups":2,"spoiler":false,"id":"5agagf","subreddit_id":"t5_2qw2b","distinguished":null,"hide_score":false,"title":"I transferred this semester to Cal Poly Pomona and majored in computer engineering.","permalink":"/r/Accounting/comments/5agagf/i_transferred_this_semester_to_cal_poly_pomona/","contest_mode":false,"domain":"self.Accounting","quarantine":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"num_comments":7,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5agagf/i_transferred_this_semester_to_cal_poly_pomona/","stickied":false,"created_utc":1477962045,"retrieved_on":1484188629,"media_embed":{},"is_self":true,"author":"Nullhitter","author_flair_text":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_5agagf","locked":false,"over_18":false,"subreddit":"Accounting"}

But every single time I bring it up to my head, there is no way in hell my finger would press down. Because I know exactly what would happen. Half of my head would be blown off, my eyes sticking out awkwardly from my ugly face, blood gushing out from my mouth and ears... but I'd be gone, pain-free, so why the hell can't I do it?\n\nI'm ugly as fuck. I've never had a friend. Never. It's pathetic that I'm not even exaggerating this, but I'm not. People stare at me. Even had a guy stare at me for 3+ minutes straight with a nasty look, and when I noticed that I was being stared at, I looked back right into his eyes. We sat there glaring at each other for over a minute before he turned his head to walk away. It doesn't help that I'm a women with a very prominent brow ridge, super small eyes, a face that belongs to an obese person even though I'm 10 pounds underweight. I've known I was ugly since I was 12. I just thought I'd grow out of it, but apparently not. I wasn't that lucky.\n\nI've never had anyone celebrate my birthday. I'm always alone on special occasions, like today. All of my 3 \"friends\" are very one worded with me, and I even admitted I was depressed to one of them. They told me to get over it, others have it worse.\n\nIt doesn't matter who I meet, I'm always treated like shit and now I even hate myself. Nowadays I have no appetite to eat, no motivation to do my work, no motivation to do anything. How can I just bypass the fear of pulling the fucking trigger? I refuse to be stuck here any longer.\n\nThis is an edit, but to carry on, I seriously don't want to die. I know this is the only conscience I'll get for eternity, and it makes me feel so fucking hopeless to see people living happily with genuine friendships, relationships, people who are just happy for no fucking reason whatsoever. I wish I was happy. Seeing how beautiful life can be given the right genetics and whatnot, I feel like a toddler being teased by an adult with a cookie, then having that cookie given to somebody else because they're better.\n\nI have many mental issues because of how poorly I was treated for being an ugly child. Every time my family held surprise parties, nobody would bring presents and the fucking party would end 15 minutes later, I shit you not. My dad was the ONLY person on this planet that genuinely loved me, he was the one who gave me my very own nickname, made me feel special, gave me presents, he was the one who spent over 400$ on surprise parties for me even though everyone else ruined it. He adored me. Now he's dead. \n\nIn school, I always sat alone. Always. Not because I was shy, not because my personality was terrible, in fact I think I can be caring if given the chance... but because people would dismiss me, be embarrassed to be seen around me (god forbid your social status if somebody was seen talking to the ugly girl), and they would give me a nasty look if I attempted to sit with them. Because of this, I sat alone all the way from elementary school to high school. All I wanted in life was a fucking friend. I'm not asking for a boyfriend or a girlfriend, but just a fucking FRIEND who likes me for who I am. \n\nI'm sick of family members always indirectly telling me how ugly I am. I'll never forget when my mom took a picture of me last month, then reviewed the shot and said out loud, \"wow so and so looks like a guy...\". I was so fucking humiliated. I just sat there and laughed to hide my shame. This type of shit always happens. \n\nNow after years of neglect, I give up.

I have PCOS and hubby has highly viscose sperm.\nFirst shitty event was when I went to pick my son up from school I don't normally go to his class but did today and wish I hadn't. The teacher normally lets the kids out in groups ie brown hair, eye colour etc however this time she let them go by saying if you have a younger brother you can go, followed by little sis, big bro/sis etc and you guessed it my son was the only child left behind and she said if you are a LONELY child not only child you can go, this really upset me..\n\nThen this morning my best friend told me she is pregnant she has a 13 month old and 11yr old, to make matters worse were the comments she made when she could obviously see I was holding back tears. She said stupid things like whining about how sick she will be at Xmas and she hates being pregnant and \" I've always wanted to have my children before I'm 30 and now I am (shes29) and when I said well aren't you lucky she said well you know you probably could have too if you tried harder, and if I gave my hubby some vitamins like her hubby has had because his sperm count used to be apparently 2million yet she concieved this baby in 3months since re started period after breastfeeding.

If you do the same thing over and over, you get the same result. So, I'm planning on doing something entirely different- I have over 150 Naltrexone tablets stocked up, and I'm planning on taking it each time I drink. I have a few ideas though and I'm trying to find someone who knows the best way to go about this.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to stay sober for a bit longer before I try this. It could just end up in me going on benders every weekend, which is not what I want. I'm thinking about staying sober for a whole year first, or maybe until I'm 26 since that's when the male's brain stops developing. Seems like a decent reason.\n\nAnyway, I know there is the Sinclair method which involves taking Naltrexone right before I drink; an hour exactly give or take. What I was wondering is if I could take it after I had been drinking for a night to prevent myself from going on a bender?\n\nWhat I miss is having a night of fun, sometimes a really long night but still a night. I don't miss being drunk for days straight. Would Naltrexone help with the cravings that happen the morning after? Like, I could take a tablet right before I go to bed to stop the alcohol from affecting my brain anymore?\n\nIf this is a stupid idea I suppose I could just take Naltrexone before I drink when I don't want to go insane. Other weekends when I do I guess I wouldn't have to. Or I maybe should just take it every time? I really don't know. I'm young and miss partying, but maybe this isn't worth it.

{"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"selftext":"Everyone's favorite season is almost upon us, and with it comes a bunch of new faces to the worlds greatest sport. Everyone who starts really has no clue what they're getting in to, so we have decided to put together a little bit of a intro for y'all to read through!\n\nFAQ:\n\n**Q:\"Will I be good?\"**\n\nA: Very very few people are their first season. I personally went 5-5 on JV my freshman year. However, it pissed me off and I was able to use that anger from my losses to train even harder that off season and during practice and well exceed my goals in each of my following seasons.\n\nThe point is, you probably won't be good. But it is only a bad thing if you don't learn from it and quit. Get pissed when you lose and use that anger to practice harder and pin the next kid who makes the mistake of stepping onto the mat with you.\n\n**Q: \"I am x'x\" and xxx pounds, will I be good?\"**\n\nA: Height is an advantage... but so is being short and strong. I am 6'1\" and 152 (well I was when I wrestled) and was very successful. My partner was our 160 who was 5'8\" and jacked. My height helped me a lot but I could never build the amount of muscle mass someone shorter than me could. It is a give and take. Learn to wrestle with your body. It all comes back to needing to practice as much as possible.\n\n**Q: \"How do I cut weight?\"**\n\nA: Eating smart and practicing hard. Running on your own. Avoid snacking and eating any time close to going to bed. Small enough breakfast to give you energy for the day. Different diets work for different people, but one thing is common between everything that works, and that is eating smart while working hard. It is as simple as that.\n\nDuring season I would have a bar for breakfast then an apple for lunch and also something before practice to power through. Then, depending if we had a match the next day and what my weight was, I would eat some salad or egg whites with chicken for dinner. If you're smart with it all, you can even pig out a little after tournaments or matches. My squad would always go to Moe's and Sonic after a good match or tournament as a reward... but we were also smart enough to never miss weight! It is a give and take\n\n**Hydration is key!** Drinking water is so important, but it is also something to be careful of. Drinking a bottle of water an hour before weighing in is like adding a pound for no real reason. There is a lot of suffering that goes into this sport, but passing out from dehydration shouldn't be a part of it. Be smart about when you drink and this won't be a problem.\n\nFind what works for you, but eating smart and working hard works for everyone.\n\nPlus, remember that most people lost between .25-1.5 pounds just by sleeping at night. Learn how much this is for you and use it to your advantage!\n\n**Q: \"Is it really that hard?\"**\n\nA: Yes. Embrace the suck and kick someone in the teeth (metaphorically of course).\n\n**Q: \"What should I expect the first few practices?\"**\n\nA: Stance, stance in motion, stance with a partner, stance, running, conditioning, some more stance, penetration steps, more conditioning and then some more of it all.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nWrestling is the world's greatest sport. Don't be like everyone who joins late and wishes they joined earlier. Especially don't be the person who \"almost\" joined the wrestling team or the person who quit after the first week because it was too hard.\n\nFor the vets: Something I pass on to all of the wrestlers that I see come through: your goal shouldn't be to make it to states. It shouldn't be to get on the podium.  It should be to win states. Get as high on the podium as possible. If you make it to the semi finals of a tournament that has six spots, then you're on the podium. You achieved your goal. The next two matches are just extra, right? No. Your goal should be as high on the podium as possible so you have even more to work for.\n\nKick it in the teeth this season, make some noise and upset some ranked bitches.","author_flair_css_class":"wesleyan","score":44,"media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"secure_media":null,"archived":false,"downs":0,"edited":1478042691,"ups":44,"spoiler":false,"id":"5ago2p","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqam","distinguished":"moderator","title":"New to wrestling?

I've looked at cognitive functions, but I still can't decide. I'm up for answering questions if anyone has any. Thanks in advance.\n\nEDIT #1: I'll add some things that may or may not help determine. I would say that I learn hands on, and from examples. I like when other people get to the point, but I'm not 100% certain if I am or not. I like learning about a lot of things, just random things that seem interesting to me at the time. But I also don't want to learn about things that I'm either not interested in, or I see no use for. I always want examples for new concepts, it really helps me understand. I prefer watching videos to get information, because visually seeing something helps a lot. I think of a lot of possible ways something could occur (e.g. if I were to kick someone, I'd always think of so many different outcomes for my action [probably a bad example]). I doubt myself a lot, and I want to try to be certain (which I usually never am). If something was mentioned, and it was connected to another thing, even slightly, I would sometimes start talking about that with my friends (and they would be confused and I would have to explain how I got there). When explaining something, I usually try to act something out, or draw some diagram of something, I also use analogies sometimes. I might add some more stuff later if I can think of anything else, I hope this extra stuff helps.\n\nEDIT #2: I just remembered that when I was younger (I'm 19 now), every time we would go to the beach I would run around a lot and I would climb up on big rocks and go explore. I learnt to play the cello as well (I don't play anymore), and from what I can remember I couldn't read the music very well, and I would learn my remembering the movements of my hand (I guess using muscle memory or something, not sure). I played with Lego a lot, and I would build the thing with the instructions first, just to see how it looked. I would then take it apart and use those blocks to build something else, of my own creation. I'm not very physical anymore, and I tend to avoid, and dislike most physical activity.

They were high school sweethearts, and stayed at their local community college in Arizona for each other.  While in their freshman year, they unexpectedly became pregnant with me. They were happy about me. They always wanted a family, age doesn't matter right ? With enough work and a little bit of faith, everything will work out. \ud83d\ude07 \n\nTo get by, we reluctantly lived at my maternal great grandmothers house. She was a bit older, and had a wrist injury that prevented her from working. She relied on social security to get by and a house she inherited. My dad worked as a waiter for his neighbors Italian restaurant, and my mom worked odd jobs here and there. My dad was studying to be a cop, my mom was studying to be a nurse. Overall we were a happy family.\n\nWhen I was about one, my grandmother got diagnosed with COPD, and her condition declined.  She couldn't watch me, so my mom dropped out of school and quit her job to be my caretaker and her grandmothers. My dad also had to drop out of college so he could work full time to pay for the bills. He grew to hate my grandmother, especially since she was a standoffish women to him, and made her resentment toward the situation known. \n\nMy great grandmother took a very fast decline over the next few years. My mother never left the house, between me and her grandmother. My father was never home, he ended up swinging a whole other life on the other side of town with some new friends. He checked in on me, but grew to care less and less. He turned to something that felt better than ones own young child's hug, the sweet hug of herion. One day, he got arrested for possession with the intent to sell.\n\nMy mom began to not have enough money for things; so she began neglected me and her grandmother to work a few towns over. She never told me about this new work; and I was only 6 around this time. All I remember is that my mom began to change in her demeanor. \n\nMy mom started wearing loose clothing, clothing that was modest and frumpy, even old fashioned. She began praying a lot more, too. I asked her if it was Jesus, but she told me that Jesus was blasphemy.\n\nWhen I was 7, my great grandmother was holding on by a thread, and my mom was gone much more. Someone from the state took over most of my great grandmother's care.\n\nMy mom started getting a little fat, but I didn't think much about it. But the bigger she got, the less I saw her. The last day I saw her, she told me that I was going to have a sister, and to wish them good health on their journey. \n\nI cried my eyes out for weeks. I was sad. I asked my teachers where my mom was, and I wrote to my dad. I thought my mom was in jail with a baby.\n\nMy dad got out; clean and sober. He took me to a special house and a social worker helped coached us on how to be a proper family. She showed us that families typically eat in a dining room, and that we should change our clothes everyday , she took me to school and him to work. All was well and eventually we moved on to live a happy life.\n\nWhen I was 12 my mom wrote me letters talking about this wonderful retreat. My dad rolled his eyes and said \"without the burden of a child she's finally free to do whatever he wants.\" Meh \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude22\n\nWhen I was 13. I was just getting off the bus from school when I saw my mom. She said she was passing through , ironically , on her way to visit us. She persuaded me to get in the car and drove me home.\n\nWhen we got home , my dad was dead. He injected himself with too much herion and ODed while I was in school. An investigation into his death led them to believe he used for awhile, but was good at hiding it. My mom held my hand and was there for me the whole time. I felt sad, I miss my dad everyday. But my mom  was there to make me feel better and I didn't want to be alone. \n\nWe used his life insurance money to stay in motels and we even took a trip to Disney world!\n\nMy mom told me, after a few months that we ran out of money and had to go back to her resort. Her resort probably was great, her postcards all seemed cheerful.\n\nThe resort's official name is Kikikaka. At kikikaka, there were a lot of girls. So far everyone's names were Endeara (41), Abigail (34) , Tracy (my mom-31) , Ena (29), Nancy (27) , Nina (23) , Leah (19), Diana (18) , Ana (15) , Gia (14 ) , myself , Fiona (12) , Arianna (6) a few babies .\n\nMy mom showed me to my bunk. I was with Diana , Ana , Gia , Fiona  and Arianna. I didn't want to share a room with these random girls I didn't know. All of my bunk mates all knew mom and hugged her tight when she got back, they knew her for years. Suddenly I was back and ready to be a part of the family. I actually kind of liked the attention . Everyone was my friend, and none of my sisters would try to steal boys or start rumors. We baked , we did our chores, we put on plays, and read stories and other fun things. Sometimes we snuck off into town with a few dollars to buy candy.\n\nI haven't been here for very long before I got my first period . I asked Ana where I could get something to put down there to get rid of the blood, because there weren't any tampons in the bathroom.  Ana gave me a wided eye expression and then got really mad at me. \" Your the last of us sisters to bled, that's not good.  \" (she excluded Arianna) \n\nWhat kind of bullshit is that! Periods are natural aren't they. I feel like now I know why the teachers in sex Ed acted funny, but I never understood why. Is it really that big of a deal?\n\nEndeara handed me some pads and the rest of the day went on like normal. Ana avoided me though. After I bled, everyone else but Arianna also had their bleed too. I guess it's true that women's cycles sync.\n\nAround 12-13 days later. My mom told Arianna not to sleep with us tonight. I was kind of jealous because that's MY mom, she's just a random girl that leaves here. But we are all sisters I guess, so I can't complain.\n\nThat night, Diana made us all clean up the room before we went to bed. Ugh chores suck. Around 3 am. I was woken up by cold air . When I opened my eyes I realized I was in a all metal room and my body was on a metal slab. I was naked. I was so cold I just wanted a blanket , but i was shivering. \n\nSomeone came over, honestly they didn't look human. Then there was my mom. My mom told me \"just let him do his job and stay calm; this is normal\". \n\nThe inhuman man took a syringe of white liquid and objected my lower pelvis with the syringe.\nMy mom undressed herself and let the inhuman man do the same for her.\n\nA few weeks later, I never bled again. I had the worst stomach virus. All of us in the room had caught it. I guess it was bad enough to make our blood stay inside of us.\n\nBut then I realized when the Nausea stayed with us, that we were pregnanct. I was only 13.\n\nWe all had our babies and kept them til they were one. If they were boys ( most of them were), after two years of being  breastfeed they were taken from us. \n\nA lot of my sisters got mean over our babies. After all they cried and were annoying to eachother.\n\nIt kept happening. Every few months after the last, after we all bled again, we would be made pregnant and then our babies would be taken from us. \n\nAfter my first son, I had a daughter. While my daughter was young they collected my son. They sent him where they sent his cousins; my sister's sons . When it came time to collect my daughter, they left her with my when they collected her second set of cousins. When we all bled again, we were impregnated again. I again had another daughter . They let me keep her too. After the last bleed and the last impregnation, and I made **another** daughter, They let me know I was unwanted. My sisters all stopped talking to me, and my food rations began shrinking. It sucked but I hoped to remain myself after I bleed again.\n\nWhen I did bleed again, everyone else disappeared but me. Even Arianna who is now 12 went with them. But I'm here, alone. The whole camp is gone.\n\nThe next morning, everyone was back but they were unhappy. They told me that since I'm 19, an adult, I need to take my three daughters 1, 3,4 and leave. I refused. I broke down. I have no home, il surely starve. They let me stay for that night.\n\nThe next morning I woke up and me and my three children were in an abandoned house in Florida, states away from Arizona. After walking around panhandling for days, I told the police my story. They admitted me to psyche but curiously enough DNA tested my children. The DNA showed up that these children weren't mine and not recognizably human. Since they couldn't validate my children and I had no psyche problems, I was declared a cult victim. A national charity  helped assist me and found us housing.\n\nNow I'm enrolled in high school. I'm working on giving my daughters up for adoption. I love them, but three kids are exhausting and I'm afraid if they stay with me, my sisters won't want me back .\n\n","score":10,"author_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"thumbnail":"self","author":"Throwaway102420167am","author_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"nosleep","over_18":false,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_5agts2","locked":false,"created_utc":1477968598,"stickied":false,"retrieved_on":1484188926,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5agts2/is_it_a_bad_thing_my_womb_only_makes_girls/","quarantine":false,"num_comments":13,"secure_media_embed":{},"permalink":"/r/nosleep/comments/5agts2/is_it_a_bad_thing_my_womb_only_makes_girls/","contest_mode":false,"title":"Is it a bad thing my womb only makes girls?","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.nosleep","distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rm4d"}

Now that I'm 2 years out of college with a full-time job, I thought it was the perfect time to get a dog. I didn't really know what I was waiting for. \n\nWell, after a month of looking around, I found Stella last Thursday. She's a 10 week old puppy that has been surprisingly good for a puppy. She isn't perfect, but I definitely lucked out in terms of temperament. She's always quiet and hasn't woken me up when I'm sleeping (I put her in a crate in my bedroom). \n\nDespite all of this, I feel so sad and overwhelmed. Day one: I cried and they weren't exactly tears of joy. I worked from home that day and after a long day of balancing both puppy and work, I broke down and cried while I was on the phone with my boyfriend. Nothing was really the matter and I should honestly be so happy that I finally have a dog... but, I can't really explain why I got so emotional. \n\nThe weekend went better and almost accident free in the apartment since I've been taking her out every 2 hours. Plus, my boyfriend came over to help me tag team. Now it's Monday and I'm sad all over again/cried/broke down. I'm fortunate to have a job that allows me to take my puppy to work, but I keep getting frustrated or even mad when I really don't need to be. I'm constantly worried that she's going to have an accident because I feel like I can't figure out her bathroom schedule. When I wanted some time to myself tonight, I put Stella in the crate because she's always been so good about it. After maybe an hour, she starts to whine a little. I know this behavior is more normal for puppies, but I feel like this is just another added on factor of stress. \n\nThere are plenty of times during the day that I kind of regret getting Stella. I try to tell myself that it will be all worth it when she's an adult, but it's really hard to look to the future when I feel so helpless right now. \n\nAre these feelings normal? I thought I was so prepared to get a dog, but now I'm just worried about potentially ruining her training foundation by doing something wrong and/or thinking that she'll hate me.

At least when I am by myself I can do activities that I like to do. Not always but eventually I\u2019d like to be with another person but then again I will want to be myself for the same reason. I simply don\u2019t know anybody who is like me.

She is 22 and I'm 28. I've always had this thing for younger girls than me, ingenue lolita type, that turn out to be wild in bed. \nSo here I've met her, 2 years ago, instantly hooked by her innocent face. After a few weeks of not keeping contact after exchanging fb's we met up and spent the day together, smoked weed and then banged like crazy on the first night. She got me hooked. \nI was working in the UK back then and met her in my home town while on holidays. After that night I left to the UK for work. \nAfter a few weeks of fb chatting nonsense I decided she is the one I always been looking for and took a one plane ticked back home. \nShe is originally from a mountain region but studies and lives in my city, so we spent that first winter going back and forth to her home town. Met her parents, got to know her little better. \n\nShe has always been a bit off, even that winter. She proved like the type of girl that goes into \"groopie\" type.  She is prone to exccesive drinking and drugs if case and party calls for it. Which I kind of look down on, as it's degrading. Personally and socially..\nWhat could I ask from a girl that worked as a bartender in a local terasse/bar.\nI'm more of a laid back type of guy, don't enjoy mindless parties and random people around me. She is the opposite and when we started dating I would play along and go to parties with her, even if I wasn't that comfortable with it or her friends. \nOur first fight was what broke my trust entirely and for good and has left me always in paranoia in trusting her was because I felt something was wrong in our 2nd month and did something I shouldnt have - checked her phone. \nAnd there it was - evidence she has been replying to a couple of guys quite random but permisive conversations. That devastated me so deeply that night that I couldnt fall asleep till the morning. When I confronted her about it she was shocked I knew and tried to get away with it then she resumed to reasoning with me about it, saying it was nothing. I played along.\nOver the past couple of years we have gone on and off mostly at first, because we were living in seperate places - me at my folks (kind of degrading at 27) and her with her flatmate girl (which was stupid af if u ask me), so it was easy to just say fuck it I'm going at first. (due to similar trust issues)\nAfter we started dating more often (during which I suspect the great sex kept me blinded to the real truth), we had a great big fight but that was somehow the moment I decided that moving in with her was the best idea to have a happy relationship.\nHer flat mate was out so it was easy. \nShe lives in a flat down central and pays less on rent as her parents know the owner. I was really happy to get out of my folks place and into a place so central for so cheap (splitting rent too).\nTime passed and living with somebody reveals the truths of that person. \nA little about her - she was an only child and raised quite spoiled and her parents always kept her snug and always gave her what she wanted. \nShe is now a 22 year old, pretty school smart (architecture 3rd yr, which attracted me), but with great issues in living tidy and she doesn't ever do something for me by herself. It's like, I always have to ask her(a massage, a kiss, a hug, a warm sanwich), and even then, the chances are I wont get it, or will get it and get it rubbed in my face next time she actually does something out of pure will (but only to do so).\nAt first I played along, thinking I knew what I was getting into and that she'll get to terms with her feelings and mine ( i loved her cuteness and innocence).\nAlso she talks so much and never pays attention to what other say or esspecially me. \nBut it only got worse. At first weed and sex kept us together as it was amazing enough for me to forget her general lack of attention towards me. But slowly, that drifted away too.. \nNow I'm left in a perpetuum flow of days when I wake up and live my day hoping we dont bump into each other until late in the day, as there are moments of cringyness and awkward silence where I space out on work or on my phone and she works on her laptop. \nAny form of interaction seems to bug her and she seems to kind of hate me for trying to \"control her life\". But all I wanted was for her to be a better woman, stop doing drugs and parties and meeting stupid people. \nThe other day I had a huge epiphany regarding my present life and paniced on how fucked up it is and decided it's time to quit this toxic relationship all together.\nI deserve and strive for a gentle kind girl/woman, that knows how to receive and appreciate attention, love and love gifts, not take it for granted. A smart girl that I have topics to talk about and the conversation going 2 ways not just one..\nI dont know how to say it to her and leave this house, because she always says she would be so hurt..\n\nAm I being to demanding or just going batshit crazy due to lack of attention from her and always trying to please her MAYBE, just maybe, Ill get some love from her? \nIt might not be the full story and Ill add to it but its late and Im tired.. I just want an external opinion..\n\nThanks!","score":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1477970395,"stickied":false,"retrieved_on":1484189001,"media_embed":{},"is_self":true,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"weno66","name":"t3_5agytg","gilded":0,"locked":false,"subreddit":"BreakUps","over_18":false,"quarantine":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"num_comments":0,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/5agytg/i_deserve_betteror_so_i_think_should_i_just_leave/","hide_score":false,"title":"I deserve better[or so I think] Should I just leave?","contest_mode":false,"permalink":"/r/BreakUps/comments/5agytg/i_deserve_betteror_so_i_think_should_i_just_leave/","domain":"self.BreakUps","subreddit_id":"t5_2ra79","distinguished":null}

You're the young teen I'm being paid to watch and you somehow make me your submissive sex slave while your parents are away...\n\nI prefer a realistic long term RP with a lot of build up... I don't actually WANT to submit to you, but eventually my resolve is worn down.\n\nI'd much rather be going to the beach with my friends but I kind of need to make extra money by watching you when you make me yours... Here's a couple ideas on how you get me to submit...\n\n1) Your cocky attitude wakes up a submissive desire inside me and I keep doing things to make you happy and please you.  (This theme can be present in the others too to help push me over the edge)\n\n2) We make a seemingly innocent bet that snowballs into more. Maybe I have to wait on you while we watch a movie and you notice I get too into it... You start pushing the bar, slowly but surely I end up submitting.  We could also make a string of bets... I keep losing and getting more and more desperate to win.\n\n3) you trick me into drinking a drug that brainwashes me and you reprogram me as your perfect slave (or maybe hypnosis...?)\n\n4) There's some sort of music you play in the background that makes me more susceptible to obeying your commands.\n\nAbout me. I'm 24, around 5'4, slightly wavy dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, 34D, sort of a girl next door/sorority girl mix. I'm looking to play around my age or a little older.\n\nI'm open to other setups as well along with other roles... I just like becoming submissive to you and needing to obey you. Other interests include breeding, bimbofication, humiliation, name calling, and much more.\n\nI'm not just looking for a rape/physical force scene; I like the mental setup of having to choose to do it but deep down not wanting to. I like detail in the RP but it doesn't have to be paragraph long responses... I also prefer more realistic play style. Like, if I lose the bet, I'm not just going to get naked \"because I lost\" it just doesn't make sense.\n\nI'm not really that big into blackmail.  It never really has a lot of build up.

I was/am beyond excited. I met the mom online and she was already a mom of a 1 year old. She's 20 which I would have thought was a little young and I was scared of being around for a kid that's not min, but we hit it off and now I love her and that little boy like he was my own, and with one on the way I was nervous but couldn't be happier to have my own little growing family \n\nShe's been on anti depressants since the start, her doctor prescribed them while pregnant to cope with her hormone changes and mood but she's been off them for a few weeks due to insurance. On Wednesday she messaged me and said she was moving to Montana and I could come or not come, she lived there briefly for 4 months and liked it and she hates her current living situation (her mom and her step dad and step sisters along with her son all live there and it's a very hostile place) she also doesn't have her liscence or a job and is stuck there all the time. Anyhow on Wednesday she said she was going to leave, I love my family and friends her and I can't imagine not being here for the birth of my first child, as well as her parents being around up here. I said I didn't think it was a good idea, we should try to get our own place and that maybe in the future we'd look at it. She didn't take this well, said she didn't feel the same about me anymore if I wouldn't drop everything to leave for her and called me replaceable. The next day she apologised\n\nOn Saturday I took her to a Halloween dinner/birthday party after she had been excited we were looking at places, she was awkward and distant most of the night as she kind of had been these past few weeks and we bickered a bit, she said she wasn't in love with me anymore and never wanted to marry me. She was thinking if we got our own place she might fall back in love but this was news to me. We unofficially broke up and now she's blocked me and won't answer me \n\nObviously I still love her and want a future, but I love that little boy too and am going to be crushed not being in his life. I also had such high hopes for my baby on the way, a happy family, being there for the birth (I balled my eyes out when I saw the ultrasound) but I just don't know what to do. My friends think she's poison and I should just lawyer up but I guess I'm holding out hope and dreaming it'll work out the way we had planned when we first got pregnant.

Anyway, I've found myself alone late on a super special spooky Halloween night in a fairly common position, messing around on the Internet, not really having the energy to focus on a movie or game but not tired enough to sleep yet, thinking about the fun things I did this weekend, and wishing that I had someone in my life to spend nights like this with.  As such, here is a post in the hopes that it might potentially help me find such a someone.\n\nAs for a little bit about myself, I'm 23 and I'm from Northern Virginia near Washington DC. I'm a fairly recent (a year ago) college graduate  (B.S. in Biology) who works in a testing lab in an entry level position  (it's a bit of a scientific sweatshop to be honest, but it's job experience). Outside of work I generally spend most of my time with friends, watching TV, reading, or on my various hobbies. I'm a huge nerd, so those hobbies include fantasy and sci-fi literature, film, games, etc. as well as some video games, quite a few of what you might call traditional games (board games, tabletop wargames, pen and paper RPGs, and such), and some craft projects related to those. I'm also something of a musician (been playing guitar for almost a decade) and I go to lots of concerts in the area. I'm also a casual sports fan, a craft beer enthusiast, and I enjoy many of the tv shows that reddit seems to like (some favorites include Dexter, Breaking Bad, Community, Rick and Morty, and recently Stranger Things). \n\nAs for what I'm looking for, it's pretty open-ended. Fundamentally what I'm looking for is someone that I can form a deep, meaningful,  and lasting connection with as a friend (ideally with some benefits) and with the potential for more. I wouldn't say that I'm looking for a romantic relationship right off the bat, but only because deliberately seeking one just seems like an easy way to rush into things too quickly and burn out on each other. The idea of things developing into a relationship like that (especially if you're close by) is in no way off the table. \n\nI don't really have any physical requirements as I like women of all shapes, sizes, colors, etc. and given that I'm making an M4F post here, it's not like I could exactly be picky anyway. I myself am of fairly average physical proportions  (5'7\", 150 or so, brown hair/eyes) and I've heard once or twice that I look a little bit like Jon Snow from Game of Thrones if that's relevant.\n\nSo yeah, there you have it. If anyone out there happens to see this post and isn't bored to death by its length and would be interested in talking and seeing where things go, feel free to reply at any time and we can discuss details. My preferred method of communication is probably kik, but I have others if that's not an option for you. Either way I'll be looking forward to hearing from you. Cheers.\n\n\n*Edit, if you're interested, don't hesitate to respond even if the post is old. What I'm looking for doesn't exactly have a time limit on it.","link_flair_css_class":null,"thumbnail":"self","id":"5ah3mj","spoiler":false,"ups":3,"edited":1480558044,"domain":"self.BaltimoreAndDCr4r","contest_mode":false,"permalink":"/r/BaltimoreAndDCr4r/comments/5ah3mj/23_m4f_nova_or_anywhere_looking_for_someone_to/","hide_score":false,"title":"23 [M4F] (NoVA or Anywhere) Looking for Someone to Mean Something (Super Special Spooky Halloween Edition)","distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2u00l","subreddit":"BaltimoreAndDCr4r","over_18":false,"name":"t3_5ah3mj","gilded":0,"locked":false,"is_self":true,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"mr_person","media_embed":{},"retrieved_on":1484189073,"created_utc":1477972206,"stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/BaltimoreAndDCr4r/comments/5ah3mj/23_m4f_nova_or_anywhere_looking_for_someone_to/","secure_media_embed":{},"num_comments":0,"quarantine":false}

My mother would always pass judgement on others and constantly make negative remarks to my sister and I about how other people lived and how our family was better. My mother would say things like \"It's ridiculous how so many of your friends parents are divorced. We wouldn't do that to our kids.\" \"You're lucky you and your sister got such good parents. We make you school lunches unlike other parents that don't give a shit about their kids.\" \"We drive you to school and the other kids take the bus because their parents don't give a shit about them.\"\n\n\nMy mother would always brag about how amazing she was as a parent, but it didn't occur to me until years later how messed up her priorities were and how she always seemed to excuse her and my dads bad behavior.\n\n\nImmediately after my parents got married they decided to buy a small house and remodel it. They started working on the house right away, but as time went on, my father would work on it less and less until he eventually stopped completely. Seven years after my parents married, they had me and the house was now in worse shape then when they bought it. Two years later my mom gave birth to my sister.\n\n\nMy sister and I grew up in this house that was now a disaster. There are no finished walls and some walls are completely missing. The unfinished walls are drywall. Some of the walls are just wood studs that you can see through. None of the ceilings are finished. The ceiling in the living room is covered in exposed pink fiberglass. My parents never tore down the bathroom that was left over from the old house, so the bathroom just sits in the middle of the living room like a four wall shack. You can walk completely around the four walls of the bathroom. The walls do not reach the ceiling. If you are using the bathroom or taking a shower, anyone who is in the living room or kitchen can hear you. How embarrassing and disgusting! My bedroom only had three walls and no door until I was 16. My dad never put up the outside wall to my bedroom where the door is supposed to be. When I was 16 I got tired of not having any privacy, so when my sister and I were home alone one day, she helped me carry a few slabs of drywall into my room and I got a hammer and some nails and put up a wall. My parents found out and my sister and I never got in trouble for this. One of the most fucked up things about this was my parents never checked to see if the wall was installed properly. The electrical wiring for the house is all exposed all over the house. There is no heating or cooling system of any kind. My parents have no AC or fans in the summer. In the winter my parents use space heaters around the house. The floors are unfinished.\n\n\nAside from the house being unfinished it is also FILTHY. When I was growing up I would hear about people doing upkeep on their house and I always thought it was weird that my parents never did any upkeep on the house. I asked my parents about this once when I was little and they told me it wasn't necessary. My mother and father are probably both hoarders or they are just lazy slobs. There are no closets in the house so clothing is either in dresser drawers, or thrown on the couch, the bed, a chair, wherever there is room. There are piles of STUFF everywhere. The kitchen table is piled with dishes and other kitchen items. I have asked my mother many times why this stuff isn't stored in the kitchen cabinets and her answer every time is that the cabinets are full. That is true. the kitchen cabinets are full. They are full of dishes and kitchen appliances she has not used or even touched since the late '80s, early '90s.\n\n\nMy dad has a lot of tools and he leave them ALL OVER the house which is gross and also dangerous. He leaves razor blades on the dining room table, he leaves saws leaning up against the washer and dryer, he leaves boxes of nails and hammers all over counter tops in the kitchen and the table we eat at. All the dishes are FILTHY. Whenever I come to visit, I will pick up a glass to get water, and the glass is sticky and cloudy and filthy. Same thing with the plates or utensils. I have asked my mom why the dishes are all filthy an sticky. She immediately gets defensive and will stare at a filthy glass I am holding while saying, \"They aren't filthy!! I just cleaned all the dishes!!!\" I will ask my father if something is wrong and why the dishes are all dirty and he will tell me in a calm but irritated tone, \"Just let it go, ok? Just let it go.\"\n\n\nThe house smells TERRIBLE. There are large chunks of dust on everything; on the tables, hanging from the ceiling, covering electrical cords. There is also extensive water damage and mold in the house.\n\n\nMy childhood had some good moments, but so many bad ones as well. In front of my sister and I my mother would beg my father on a weekly, sometimes daily basis to finish the house. He would just sit in his chair, look down at the floor, say nothing, and ignore her. My sister and I would also ask my father to please finish the house. We didn't have a closet on our bedroom, we kept getting splinters in our feet from the unfinished floors, and we couldn't invite friends over. He would tell my sister and I \"Yeah, I'll start working on it,\" and then he would do NOTHING.\n\n\nIn front of my sister and I my mother would constantly accuse my father of cheating on her. I think at the youngest I was about 5 years old when I remember her doing this, and she continued to do this in front of my sister and I the entire time we were growing up. She would start screaming matches with my father about the women he was sleeping with. Sometimes she would mention women's names or other details my sister and I didn't want to hear about. When my sister and I became teenagers, my mother started talking to my sister and I about my father's cheating and about how my father was also physically abusive to her. At first we felt bad about this, but then after a while we became uncomfortable and asked her to stop telling us these things. She would get mad and would not stop talking about this stuff with my sister and I.\n\n\nMy mother was around a lot more than my father when we were growing up. My father worked about two hours away, and he worked long hours. Sometimes he was gone when my sister and I got home from school, and he didn't get back home until after we went to bed. My mother worked a retail job at a store about 10 minutes from where we lived so we were always with her. She was insanely overprotective. It was okay when we were little, but when we were teenagers it became a problem. We weren't allowed to do anything. We weren't allowed to cross the street alone, we weren't allowed to go shopping with friends alone, we weren't allowed to go to the movies alone. One time when I was 15 or 16 my mother somehow agreed to let me go to the mall with my friends. After about an hour at the mall, I was in a store with my friends when I saw my mother walk up to us. She threw a tantrum and told me I was awful and ungrateful and was coming with her NOW because I had failed to call her to let her know I was okay. I was 16 and she left work just to do this!! She was always very irresponsible and unprofessional.\n\n\nMy parents were both abusive. They were both mentally, verbally, and physically abusive, but it was my father who was mostly physically abusive, and my mother was mostly verbally abusive.\nIt sounds crazy, but I truly believed I was brainwashed and I believe it was easy to brainwash me because I was so isolated. When I was growing up my parents kept my sister and I very isolated. We couldn't invite friends over because the house was so awful. When I tried to make friends, my mother would find me and demand I come with her and leave my friends. My mother would also make me believe that everyone was awful and terrible and a liar and dangerous. I think she did this to further isolate me so I would trust only her.\n\n\nThese are some of the crazy things my mother told me when I was a kid/teen and I think I might have been brainwashed: \n\n--- People who drink alcohol, even champagne at a wedding are losers, lowlifes, dangerous.\n\n--- Any time I wanted to walk home from school with a friend to hang out, or go to a movie with friends, or go shopping with friends, or sleepover at a friends my mother listed many (crazy) reasons why I wasn't allowed to, but the reason she gave me the most was \"You could get kidnapped and raped.\"\n\n--- My mother wouldn't let me learn about certain things in school, so while the teacher was in the middle of a lesson, my mother would make me sit in another room in the school, or I would stay home from school that day.\n\n---I wasn't allowed to participate in any school activities because my mother wasn't there to supervise, or I could get raped. I was pulled out of activities in elementary school, I wasn't allowed to participate in 8th grade camp, I wasn't allowed to join any after school groups or clubs or sports teams.\n\n---My mom refused to teach my sister or I any life skills and if we insisted my mom would have a meltdown and throw a tantrum. She refused to teach us how to cook, clean, do laundry, pump gas, or drive. I took drivers ed classes in school in the mornings before regular classes. After I got my permit I was told to practice by driving with a licensed adult as much as I could. I would ask my mom and she would scream \"Not now!!\" I would then go to my dad and he was always happy to go on a drive with me. As soon as my mom found out, she would throw a tantrum in front of my dad and I and tell me \"You're creating problems!! You don't know how to drive!! Why do you make problems?! You're ungrateful!! I will be telling your grandmother and your friends how awful you are!!\"\n\n--- I asked my mother about taking the ACT/SAT. She told me it wasn't necessary. I told her I wanted to take them to go to college. She told me \"Sorry, but they aren't necessary. I didn't take them because they aren't necessary.\"\n\n---My parents never talked to me about college. I didn't even know that parents actually took their kids to visit college campuses. I thought this was something that was exaggerated on tv and in movies. When my friends were talking about visiting campuses I asked my mother and father. My mother said she refused to drive without my father. she also said, \"Ughhh!!! Why do you have to come up with more shit I don't want to do!! I don't want to spend my time driving for hours! You're always creating problems and coming up with shit that I don't want to do!! Not happening! Not happening!\"\n\n--- If I ever mentioned going to college, or large salaries, my mom would get really nasty and tell me \"You're living in a fantasy world.\" I would tell her, \"If you go to school and study and work hard it is possible to go into a well paying career.\" Her response was \"Yeah ok. You don't know what you're talking about. That's not the real world. Sorry. That shit doesn't really exist.\"\n\n\nMy parents didn't teach my sister and I anything. My dad wasn't around a lot. My mom never discussed anything with my sister and I unless it was frivolous, pointless shit. She never talked to us about science, history, math, anything at all. Still to this day, this is how she is. If you talk to her about anything she just stares at you or changes the subject. The only thing she talks about is Hallmark movies, romance novels, or other superficial shit. She also believes in fairies and tarot readings and psychics. You might wonder, if she never taught my sister and I anything, then how did we spend our time together? Shopping!! That is all we ever did. Every Saturday and Sunday (and sometimes weekdays if homework was done) was spent shopping.\n\nI never looked up to my parents. When I was little this made me really sad, and I never understood why I felt this way until I got older. I never looked up to my father because he wasn't around a lot, so I don't really remember him from when I was really little. The other reasons are because he was very physically abusive, he cheated on my mom, he was really mean, he was and is incredibly spiteful, he was neglectful, and he refused to finished the house. I never looked up to my mom because she was/is ignorant, she had chances to go to college but made up excuses why she couldn't go, she took no responsibility for the house or for raising my sister and I in that awful dirty house, she was/is verbally abusive, she didn't teach my sister and I anything.\n\nI was told that I wasn't allowed to go away to college. I feel embarrassed now but back then I was afraid of my mother and I was afraid of her tantrums and her threats so I backed off and didn't go away for college. The only college I was allowed to attend was a terrible for profit college that is not out of business. I remember coming home from orientation and the first day of class and telling my parents that it was a terrible school and that I didn't want to go there. My mom told me I was creating problems and I had no other options. I listened to her and continued to attend. The school was terrible. I moved to a big city to transfer to their larger campus because I heard that it was better. I also continued to attend because I found out that the school wasn't accredited and none of my credits would transfer to another school. The school ended up closing and I never got a degree from this school.\n\n\nAfter I quit school I ended up meeting my boyfriend and I started working entry level jobs. For the first time in my entire life I was completely on my own and I was 27. The world felt surreal. I am now 32 and the world still feels surreal at times.\n\n\nCurrently I struggle with so many issues. I blame myself for not getting away from my parents sooner. From the age of 27 until now I have worked different retail jobs and never felt accomplished. It has taken me a really long time to understand and learn that my parents brainwashed me and taught me really crazy shit that wasn't true. I am angry because I wish I had the opportunity to have gone to a really great college, get a degree and gain experience in a field I'm interested in. I am embarrassed that I spend my 20s going after retail jobs with no future. During that time I didn't want those jobs but I always felt that I had no other options, and I always felt like something was missing, but I didn't know what it was. I know now that it was my upbringing. It was all I was ever taught. My mom only ever worked low paying dead end jobs. She had the opportunity to go to college and she would make up excuses or bitch about why she couldn't go. I was also told that I was living in a fantasy world if I thought I would be able to go to a good college and get a good paying job.\n\n\nI know people like to say to grow up and get over it but I have just began realizing how abusive my parents were and I'm still coming to terms with it.\n\n\nTwo years ago my mother finally had proof that my father was cheating on her. She got really upset and had a fit. My fiance and I were in town for Christmas and we were at my parents house when this drama occurred. My mother started packing her bags and said she was moving out. I asked my father if he was upset about my mother leaving and he laughed while telling me \"She isn't moving out.\" No one takes my mother seriously because during my entire childhood, my mother would get mad at my father and she would tell all of us that she was moving out. She would pack her clothes and put them in her car, then she would calm down after a few hours. So, it's the day after Christmas and my fiance and I are visiting at my parents house. My father is at work and my mother is packing. It was uncomfortable because we all know she is really moving out. She asks my fiance to drive her to look at an apartment. That night my fiance and I drive back home and things get worse.\n\n\nMy mother is now calling and texting me nonstop telling me different things like \"I'm going to have a heart attack because of what your dad did to me\" \"But I love him. Why would he do this?\" After a few months she became less sad and now she was angry. She would call and text me and tell me that I needed to call my father and tell him how shameful it is that he did this to the family. When I refused to call him she would tell me I was a coward. She would also tell me I wasn't allowed to have any contact with my father. But she was still living with him, still making dinner for him, and still going out for dinner and coffee with him. Currently our relationship is not that great. I'm not really interested in talking to her because of the resentment I have from the way she raised me and I'm also tired of her insulting me and telling me how awful I am because I refuse to get involved in her marriage problems. She refuses to leave my father.\n\n\nNo one in my family is educated. Everyone in my family works a low paying job, or is on disability, or doesn't work at all. They all have time to sit around and hang out and complain about money. My sister drives a cab, my cousin has a baby because when she was 18 her mom let her unemployed boyfriend move in to their house and he got her pregnant. No one in my family seems to have any ambition. You can't have a conversation with any of them, because they are all so ignorant and they have no idea what is going on in the world. I hate to say it but my family is ignorant, stupid white trash and I have so much shame because of this. No one in my life knows this except my fiance. My in laws and my friends have no idea my family is like this. I have made sure none of them have ever seen my parents house that I grew up in.\n\n\nIs it too late for me? I am 32, I was a C student in high school because I was verbally and physically bullied a lot and of course my parents did nothing to help, I come from a low class, ignorant, uneducated family. How will anyone ever hire me or take me seriously? I have a lot of self hate and I put myself down a lot, but I know I am incredibly smart. I have no work experience other than entry level retail job experience. How do I explain my past to an employer or to a college I apply at? I'm really embarrassed by my past and by my family. I'm embarrassed that I allowed them and their craziness to continue to control me into my 20s. I am embarrassed that because of my parents mental, verbal, and physical abuse I still struggle with anxiety, depression, low self esteem and an inferiority complex. My goals and dreams are to learn how to cope with the past and move on, learn how to not let my moms verbal abuse effect me (yes she is still verbally abusive to me to this day), to go to college, to grow, to learn, to gain work experience and be qualified for a great career. I know because of my terrible life and past I could never get into an Ivy League school, but could I ever go somewhere great like NYU for example? Could I ever go for a masters degree or will I be too old by then?\n\n\nHas anyone else gone through something similar? I've met people with problems. Everyone has problems. But I've never met anyone with a family as dysfunctional as mine and it makes me feel very alone and like I'm the only one who has a dysfunctional, ignorant, abusive family.\n\n\nTL;DR My family is dysfunctional, uneducated and low class. Their verbal, mental, and physical abuse and neglect have caused me anxiety and extremely low self esteem. I want to know how I can turn my life around.","saved":false,"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_css_class":"happytipRBN","downs":0,"secure_media":null,"archived":false,"media":null,"link_flair_text":"[RBN]"}
