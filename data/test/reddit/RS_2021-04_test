I've been doing nearly everything for her. Cooking, all cleaning, paperwork, phone calls etc.\n\nFor now she is still able to drive very short distances and bathe\/toilet on her own. But that's it.\n\nThis is the thing I could use some advice for if possible: How to emotionally support her.\n\nShe has been very upset about her declining health, which is definitely understandable.\n\nThis week she had a long overdue doctor's appointment. Her bloodwork results came back and they said the results were concerning. They said they will need further tests\n\nShe's been especially upset about this and has been crying.\n\nHowever, I'm struggling to help her with this. It's always been difficult for me but it's gotten worse.\nMy mom has always had some occasional anger issues\nAnd when she vents she vents with a very angry, aggressive tone and it sets off my anxiety.\nI have depression, anxiety and ADHD.\n\nI have some trauma from yelling\/ verbally aggressive people from my childhood and it shows very obviously when she vents because I start shaking and my heart races.\n\nA few hours ago she needed to vent and and told me she's scared and doesn't want to get sicker or die. I started feeling a panic attack coming on and I tried my best to hide it and listen but I started shaking. She saw this and got sad and thinks she shouldn't talk to me about this anymore. I feel awful about this\n\nShe doesn't have any other friends\/family to talk to. She refuses therapy because of a bad therapist she had in the past.\nI'm all she has for emotional support and I need to learn to help her and try to be a good listener.\n\nI'm scared and I've been having mental breakdowns even before this. I feel like I'm worthless as a caregiver\n\nI do have my first therapy appointment scheduled but it's not for a while yet\n\nThank you for reading this post...

I have a short story to tell of my experience. I'm not looking for sympathy or pity. If anything, I want this to raise a bit of awareness of some of the less obvious side effects of being colorblind.\n\nTo start, I'm 16, in my Junior year of highschool (grade 11). I learned I was colorblind in 7th grade when I noticed I had to read crayons and colored pencils and markers to know what color they were and that I struggled with colors on, for ecample, maps in history textbooks. This year, in early January, I noticed it was a lot more severe than I thought. See, I started online school last semester due to covid. I was dumped into Art Appreciation and we were starting some color-based stuff in chemistry.\n\nWell, I'll start with my chemistry exlerience. We were doing pH and acidity and whatnot. I couldn't for the life of me read the pH strip. First time I'd ever failed an assignment due to color, but the teacher was understanding and let me redo it with help from him.\n\nArt Appreciation was a new class that changed at semester to replace Music Appreciation. We started the unit and I got docked many points for \"inaccurate descriptions\". I asked what I did wrong, explained that I'm at least a little colorblind. I was mixing up colors I'm not used to mixing up. Light blue with gray and pink, orange with grass green, and dark red with black. Colors if never real given thought to.\n\nA few days later I'm trying to learn to cook. I open some ground beef, plan on making some lunch that I can reheat for dinner. First time cooking, gotta start somewhere, eh? Well, it burned. I never saw it brown. By the time it was noticeably cooked it was starting to become burnt.\n\nThis had me curious about the severity of my colorblindness. It hasn't really affected my life before, so it was worrisome. I took at least 15 different online tests, most of which were at varying brightbesses and websites on my laptop. All of them came back with the same result: severe protanomoly. Im still trying ti get my family to have an official test done so its on the record.\n\nThis took place over about 2 and a half months. I remembered a couple weeks ago that \"holy shit I graduate in 1.5 years and I probably need to do something about that\". Start looking into the careers I was interested in. Then it hit me that I'm colorblind. Do a little research, see what lines up that I cannot do anymore. \n\nTicked off just about everything. Science-based jobs, medical research, landscaping, engineering (not that there's a job market for it anyways), web dedign, forensics. Just about anything I had a slight interest in was removed. I was devastated, lost even. I'm still lost as a matter of fact.\n\nI spent a lot of time thinking about this. I feel useless, I'd go as far as to say I feel broken. I can't do much on my own. I can't cook, my outfits will always be based on neutrals (as they have been for 5 years now, looks like that won't change at all) so I don't look retarded, and my future has basically been snuffed out. Last Thursday I was overwhelmed.\n\nAfter failing another assignment I went to get the mail. Saw a car coming, considered how easy it would be to quit. To just give up and die. How I had no future anyways so there was no point in living.\n\nNot even thinking about the consequences, I took a step, then another. A third would've put me in the road. A fourth would've killed me, no doubt. If I had moved any sooner I wouldn't be here. I would be dead or in the hospital. Not that it changes much, in all honesty, considering I still have no future to look forward to.\n\nI'm not proud of that choice. I regret it. For a couple days after I thought of who exactly I would be hurting if I did move that much sooner. My friends, my family, even the driver of that car would've been very upset and some of them would go on blaming themselves. It's not healthy, but they're the only reason I didn't wait for a second car and try again.\n\nI felt that I needed to apologize to them, so I've spent the last week making a lot of calls, texting a lot of people. I can't bring myself to tell my family. I can't look them in the eye, but I know they'd probably disown me based on how they reacted to my sister cutting herself several years ago.\n\nI'm not okay.

I've been asked if I have it\/take meds for as long as I can remember (I'm 17 and a junior in high school btw). I can't concentrate on anything and it's so bad that it affects my relationships and my work (school and job) and et cetera. My grades are bad and I'm wondering how I'm gonna get into college even tho my test scores are high. When I bring up the fact that I think I have ADHD to anyone they agree with me and say that I probably do have it or they'll just straight up say something about me having ADHD without me saying anything, but the thing is, whenever I bring up wanting to go see someone for a diagnosis they tell me, \"oh no you don't have ADHD,\" or they'll say, \"you're a 17 year old boy (or junior) of course you can't focus.\" It makes me so mad. For instance, today I was talking to my girlfriend of about a year and a half about it and said I wanted to go see someone to get a diagnosis and she said \"you don't have ADHD\" and she started comparing me to other people she knows who have ADHD. She also asked me why I want to get a diagnosis. Like, I want to know if I actually have it and if I can get help. She said that I just want a diagnosis for attention. She also kept telling me that I'm not going on meds for it and I said that it's not her decision to make. She told me that if I did, she wouldn't date me. I know that they have side effects and that they can change your personality and such, but life is just so hard with this and my job and school work are not doing too well. Anyway, sorry for ranting just had to get that off my chest so I came here. Thank you if you read all of this :)\n\nEdit: I never even mentioned taking medication for it.

I'm 29 years old. Since I was young. I was always interested in the Funeral Industry. It always seemed very interesting. I had always thought about it. In the back of my mind. But family and friends always discouraged it. And several years ago. When I was at a viewing. I ended up converstating with the Funeral Director\/Embalmer. And asked him would it be wise for me to go in this industry. At the time. I was pursuing to be a State Trooper.  He basically told me to stay away from this as a job. That it was too hectic\/stressful and said being a State Trooper was a much wiser choice. I have reached out to several Funeral Homes in the past in hopes to get my foot in the door. With no success.  I'm currently a Medical Supply Manager. The pay and benefits are good. But I absolutely hate my job. And find it so unfulfilling and boring. I have ADHD and get bored easily. And was told being a funeral director is like planning a wedding in 2 days. And that sounds exciting and mentally stimulating. In college I took a Personality Test and tested for clergy or a job helping the public. Basically, deep down inside. I've always felt I wad called to do this. And I'm so miserable because I put it off. And I'm finally at my breaking point from being burnt out.  Anyone have any tips on how to get my foot in the door? And what do you think the future holds for the industry? I've read embalming is dying out. And creation and celebrations of life are the future trend. I've even read life planners are what will trend. Also, is there anyway to figure out if you have what it takes to embalm? I feel like I would be able too. But I feel that's something you won't actually know. Until you experience it first hand. I also live in a major city. In Northeast Florida if that helps.  \n\nThanks everyone.

Maybe that happens, maybe. Probably not, but maybe. I'm here because I have some short term financial goals. Besides, I like gambling, and in Vegas, and Vegas is so boring right now. Besides, when you're trading options there's not a mathematical certainty that you will lose money over time. (Quite the opposite in fact, but that is a different post.) That's a huge advantage to gambling on options as opposed to gambling at a craps table. \n\nHere are my short term financial goals:\n\n1: Hit 15k in my trading account then immediately transfer out 5k. (Please don't bother me with tax warnings, I'm 35, I know about taxes, been paying them for 20 years.) I want to place myself in a no-lose situation.\n\n2: Hit 15k a second time, and make one huge 5k YOLO bet on options with less than 24 hours until expiry.\n\n3: I'm going to assume I lose that one and I'm back at 10k. Then I'm going to hit 5k again and withdraw. Immediately send 2.5k to Uncle Sam and Grandpa Newsom, and use the rest to buy workout sessions for the rest of the year. (I like bodybuilding. But I'm literally autistic and I have a shitton of issues with compound movements, I just can't get them right without a trainer.)\n\n4: The next withdrawal is when I hit 20k again. I'll take out enough to have a nice trip to Japan with my partner.\n\n5: If I hit 55k I'll do another 5k YOLO bet on, you guessed it, WOTM calls or nearly expired calls.\n\n6: If I hit 50k, I'm getting a fucking Toyota Tacoma with all the shit, like, I mean, all the shit\n\n7: If I can hit 100k, I'm going to take 50k and put it down on a house.\n\n8: If I hit 50k again, I'll do the biggest YOLO bet I've ever done and throw down all 100k on, you guessed it, WOTM calls on a single security.\n\nBy the way, this is NOT how I run my retirement account. My retirement account is basically half VGT, 10 shares of TSLA, 100 shares of Apple, 5 shares of the BRK that can split, and the rest in Vanguard's large cap growth fund.

The E logo looks like a phone that no one even owns anymore.  The fonts are all childish, to be simply put.  Everyone of the logos say \"elon gate\" on them which is not only way too many letters but also not necessary.  The colors I will say are bold and exciting so the colors can stay but the rest has to go.  Logos are psychological, it's more than just a junior high project.  I will make a good logo if it's used.

everyone.\n\nI am a 29 y\/o male on the wrong side of 300 lbs. I recently decided to get off my ass and do something about it. I have dropped about 20 lbs in the last month or so through diet and light exercise, most of it bloat from a less than flattering drinking habit I also kicked.\n\nI am eying a sprint distance triathlon in early October and am curious if I am being overly aggressive with the goal. Once upon a time I was a capable swimmer, I own a great Specialized bike and used to regularly ride it 25 miles with a lot of elevation, and have ran 5ks in the past. Never in succession mind you. The bigger problem as I see it is that I have done effectively no physical exercise for 3ish years outside of walking and the elliptical in the last month. Packing on 80 lbs in that timeframe is also not great.\n\nI think a realistic weight by October has me in the 240's - 250's, but potentially lower if I really up the exercise. Last time I was 240ish, I was able to do all the running\/biking\/swimming I mentioned previously. I am 6'4 with a big frame, so it is not as bad as it might sound.\n\nI want something just on the edge of obtainable to really drive me, but I don't want to find out that I way over shot it as I dig into a training program. I tend to do better once I make concrete commitments, so I kind of want to just pull out my wallet and sign up right now.\n\nShould I just start with 5ks and maybe push the goal to 2022, or do you think this something I might actually have a shot at? If so, how might you go about tackling the training?  \n\n\nEDIT: Wow! What a great and confidence boosting response. I have paid for the race and am up early this morning to hit the stationary bike as the first step in my training plan. I hope to be back soon to update you all on my progress. Again, thank you so much for your kind words!

By the end of the semester I'll be able to tack off at least 10k of the roughly 22k of debt I'll have, and I'm positive I'll be able to get that down by at least another 4 or 5k within the first 6 months of graduating (before it gains interest in my region). Not bad! I have a pretty well paying job for my age and despite the pandemic so I'm very grateful for this. \n\nGiven these factors I can begin seriously considering a Rhinoplasty, a procedure I've wanted for around 7 years since the 10th grade. Given the likelihood I'll be college debt-free by the time I'm 23, I also would like to enjoy my 20s with more confidence\/self assurance.  \n\nI have a consultation with a surgeon a colleague recommended to me this Saturday. Quotes range anywhere from 9800-14500 CAD. For this reason, I've been considering the possibility of applying for a loan to cover 30-50% of the cost of a Rhinoplasty, and save the other half myself over the course of 2021 along with my school debt plan. I can't find a ton of information regarding if this is an effective idea. I'd like to look like my ideal self sooner rather than later, and given my financial situation I think it could be viable. Can anyone speak to this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks so much!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PlasticSurgery","subreddit_id":"t5_2qkya","subreddit_subscribers":72699,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Taking out a loan to cover half of a Rhinoplasty price?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.78,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PlasticSurgery\/comments\/mhjmbs\/taking_out_a_loan_to_cover_half_of_a_rhinoplasty\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I followed a lot of advice on here and it worked so for that I am extremely appreciative. I was able to snag a low level job in the techmod department at the local school district. Some days I was driving the van around delivering laptops other days I was repairing Chromebooks and other days I was unboxing laptops, imaging them, tagging them, and boxing them back up. Nothing too technical, but this put me in proximity to the people I wanted to talk to(just as this thread had directed me). \n\nOne day I was assigned a project with the engineering team and busted my butt for them. I saw a job posting in the department soon after and applied. I nailed the interview and they knew I was not as qualified as maybe they would like someone to be, but they gave me a shot because of the hard work I had shown when given a chance before. Now my current title is an ITSS and I do basic administration on some of the platforms we use for the school as well as some scripting and automation work in Python and Google Apps Script(JavaScript). \n\nI have questions about career and I thought this thread would be good to come back to because you all have been a big help before. I have my associated in CIS and finish my BS in cybersecurity in 1.5 years. My questions are:\n\n1. How long should I stay in this job before I look to move on?\n2.

I think I have ADHD. I've never been diagnosed with it but I've always struggled with learning, concentration, and retaining information. I've always learned better visually rather than reading to learn but even then, holding onto the information is still incredibly hard for me. I also have really bad anxiety, so having someone \"watch\" me take the test is kind of freaking me out, too. I'm super thankful that I can do it online and in the comfort of my own home but the thought of this virtual person watching me take the test is nerve-wracking. I don't know how I'm going to do this. I feel pretty confident in my Language Arts capabilities but honestly? I've taken a few practice tests and every time they give me a big block of text to read, it's incredibly hard to follow along. My mind wanders and I take in maybe two sentences before forgetting everything else. And math? Ugh. I don't even wanna think about math, lol.

The recovery here was great. Since my repair I ran 3 half marathons and got in the best shape of my life. \n\nJump forward to now I'm 31 and this past summer I started to notice an audible \"cruchiness\" when doing exercises like squats or lunges in the same knee so I went to PT for a few months to strengthen the muscles in the area and make sure I had adequate flexibility in the area. I graduated from this PT and returned to modified workouts, but noticed swelling in my leg and a bit of snapping pain after more intense workout sessions. I went back to see the doctor who did the ACL repair who referred me to a cartilage specialist in his office who met with me. Eventually I had imaging done and the cartilage lesions were revealed, so I first had an arthroscopy to clean up any loose bodies and allow the surgeon a look \"under the hood.\" The following was noted in the op. note: patella full-thickness grade 4 articular cartilage lesion 1 cm x 1 cm central facet, trochlear grade 4 lesion 2 cm x 2 cm, medial femoral condyle grade 4 lesion 2 cm x 2 cm with removal of chondral flap.\n\nIn my post op appointment the surgeon mentioned the MACI procedure to fill these lesions, but also discussed that I was a boarderline case for a High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO) as well, noting  3\u00b0 varus malalignment of the tibiofemoral mechanical angle compared with my other knee. \n\nMy opinion is I'd rather not get an osteotomy if I don't have to have one, but would appreciate any perspective or advice that the community could offer in my decision making. Further, I have had a second opinion on this matter from another cartilage specialist. The second opinion was much more open to the idea of just the MACI as opposed to MACI + HTO. \n\nAnd here's just a general question in this scenario, after a second opinion, am I in a position to tell the doctor which surgery I want, even if it runs counter to his initial diagnosis? \n\nThanks for taking a look. To give you a bit more context on my body type, I'm  5'11 and about 185 LBS.\n\nMore than willing to connect with anyone, or share more info if that is helpful.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"KneeInjuries","subreddit_id":"t5_2yj3r","subreddit_subscribers":2178,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"MACI vs MACI with HTO","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/KneeInjuries\/comments\/mhk05z\/maci_vs_maci_with_hto\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I just want some romantic harmless fun with a little smut.\n\nIf you're interested in making a long story, with a light-hearted tone, feel free to message me. And when I reply, please reply back. There's an astounding number of people on here who message me and then ghost me without so much as as a reason. Anyway, I hope we have fun!\n\n@fatboywonder101","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"KikRoleplay","subreddit_id":"t5_3g4xs","subreddit_subscribers":14345,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"(M4F) Won't you make a story with me?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/KikRoleplay\/comments\/mhk745\/m4f_wont_you_make_a_story_with_me\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

And I used to be like that. Then I started being heavily depressed and then obsessed about my daydreams, and i eventually had a terrible breakdown. That was when i started feeling very confused about what was real or not. As if reality was fake or it was fading. Everything felt blurry, foggy, heavy. Even the air. And these got only worse.\n\nI started hearing this very aggressive and violent voice that told me the most awful things. And I remember talking with her out loud(\"she\" had no face or body or a name), \"we\" used to argue even, and those would end with me hurting myself in any shape or form. If i didn't, she would literally torment me. It was terrible, and unbearable. She would constantly shame me or blame me for stupid stuff. She would also tell disturbing stuff about other people as well. (I also heard other voices but they were more like background noises) And even worse, I would sometimes see gory imagery pop up in front of me like a vision and she would use these to threaten me. She would threaten me a lot. So I would sleep or hurt myself to avoid her but those sleeps were never comfortable. I failed most of my classes because I would sleep all day.\n\nThen I started being afraid of her taking control of my body, and she would tell me that she would do it if I didn't act the way she wanted me to.\nAnd the funny thing is she wouldn't tell me to do anything violent, but to always be depressed and miserable but also shame me for doing so. \n\nI'm a religious person. But I wouldn't do my \"religious duties\" so she used this against me. Because of her I started believing that anything that slightly \"bad\" happened to me was because god hated me, and he was punishing me. I wouldn't even say I love things (songs, people etc.) because I thought if I did, god would take it away from me because I loved it more than god. I couldn't sleep at nights because I would see something, then think that i would die that day if I slept. None of these makes sense now, but I was terrified back then.\n\nThese happened somewhere between 2016 to 2018, but I'm still not exactly sure how long it lasted.\n\nI was a mess, both mentally and physically. I was either constantly confused or scared, or completely empty. I remember not taking a shower for a whole month and be okay with it, not eat or not drink some days. Some days people would talk to me but I wouldn't understand a word, and I would talk but couldn't hear what I even say. I don't know how I survived. At the time I didn't even know psychosis was a thing, so i considered all that stuff to be real. I treated them like normal stuff that meant to happen until a year ago when I found out about psychosis and this sub. And since then I started asking myself if what happened to me was psychosis or not. Well most recently because of a post I saw I started questioning even more. And I'm still questioning and am still confused...\n\nSorry this is too long.

Should I get on a demo program in that case and look for the other parts used? \n* Or should I just keep renting until I can find a full system used?\n\nI definitely don't want to buy everything new, even if I have the finances because the difference could be going towards jumps\/tunnel time.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank you all for your replies and insights.

I'm 32, and I definitely already know that's not a great launching point for a solid relationship, but long story short we fell in love. He was quite the quintessential man ho bartender, slept with 4 of my Co- workers before we even started hanging out and I knew about them even when we did. But I wasn't looking for anything serious at the time. He was just hot and fun and so was I. We didn't plan on becoming so serious but we did, as cliche as it sounds it feels like it was meant to be.  We have changed each other and grown so much through our relationship and love for one another. But here's where it gets complicated, he has another gf who he lives with.. He always did. Now before you hate me just hear me out-- the situation with his other gf was more out of comfort since they had been together for so long and their living arrangements etc. He loves her and they have history and I can respect that. She has stuck by him through everything. He has kids with another woman from a previous earlier relationship and she was with him through a lot of drama that came with that. She is also completely aware of him stepping out on her numerous times, but shell never leave him no matter what. Back to now --- so when him and I got serious I ended up telling her the truth (she knew he was with someone else but not that it was serious). She was obviously heart broken at first knowing he actually LOVED someone else, but with time she accepted it and we are living this strange unique reality where we are both in a relationship with him and know about each other but don't communicate. Somehow it works, but I definitely go through periods of time where I feel ashamed and worthless and stupid for being in something that won't go anywhere. What we have is real but I know he'll never incorporate me into his family and we aren't building a future together. Because im not number one and I've had to kind of hide in the shadows until everything was out in the table. His other gf is the one that has been there for his kids and family for like 20 years. Not me. And im.not close with my family and they are far away. Anyway I think that's enough preliminary information in order to get to the real question that is heavy on my heart rn. We are both much healthier people not being in the service industry, we fight less, drink less, do more. But he's a full blown alcoholic and im.not, I've always been able to keep my drinking from impacting work. And I've been unemployed for a year due to the pandemic and I'm ready to start making money again and doing something productive. I got a job at this nice bar and restaurant and he is against me going back to work he is very possessive and jealous and also doesn't think it's a respectable enough job for me to have. He threatened to go back to bartending If I do...and thinking of us backtracking to how we were scares the shit out of me. It was so toxic.  We've come too far for that. It breaks my heart to think about losing all the progress we've made. But at the same time the other part of me is screaming that this the opportunity to finally break away from him and face the reality of us not having a future together and him holding me back from having one. I feel like taking this job I will regret it if I do and I'll regret if I don't. I need advice ! Please help! Only non judgmental understanding vibes please, I'm already very hard on myself.

My English isn't great, so please excuse me if I make some language mistakes.  \nHere is what I am here for, I met J(28Y\/M) in the beginning of 2020, that was also the start of the pandemic, he is American and has never been to China before. We met on a dating app, and we fell in love with each other, and things went perfectly well, we both felt so right for each other, we both decided to do this ldr, and it was his first ldr, I wasn't feeling very secure in the very beginning, because the travel ban that America lifted for China, but he often encouraged me that we will be together and it built up my confidence.  \nHe was absolutely a sweet and loving boyfriend, he said good mornings and good nights to me everyday, promised me a future, with that faith and determination, we worked towards that direction of us being together eventually, it was something that made my 2020 better.  \nI could tell that he really loved me very much, we have been through up and downs, but we always worked through it. It was a productive relationship.  \nWe both have depression, but we try to maintain our heads in a good place so we don't hurt others.  \nUntil March.2nd, 2021, we were talking about kids, and I was showing my fear of having kids.. He asked me if kids was a \"deal breaker\", due to my poor English I thought deal breaker meant doubts or not something serious... And we talked about it the next day... And I checked on the word deal breaker and realized it was a serious word... So I explained to him.. And I told him I also checked on google about advice if ur partner has doubts for having kids, they provided 4 questions that we can ask our partner, the first one was \",Could you compromise for ur partner if you think you can't stand the idea of breaking up with her(him)?\" So I let him answer first.. He said\"I don't see myself changing mind of having kids\"..... But actually to me, I can compromise or overcome the fear of having kids for him, because I love him and I don't want to leave him. After he gave me that answer, I got disappointed, because I felt that he wanted kids more than me... I got mad... And he said he was falling apart because I said it was a deal breaker, he thought I really meant deal breaker, and he was falling apart...  \nAnd ever since that... He became very cold and distant, and he said he wasn't feeling well, he felt anxiety and depression were eating him up...he said the pandemic drove him crazy, and he didn't even see family for a while, no hug from anyone. he said he needed a break.... he said it flipped his world upside down...  \nBut I misunderstood that word, and he misunderstood me , and he didn't listen to my explanation.  \nThen I had been in a really tough situation cus he just didn't talk to me.... One time I called him... He said he didn't realize how hard this ldr was until then, and he was saying that he can't do it, he told me he felt like dying and he wanted to wait for me and another him doesn't...  \nI got really heartbroken and sad, but I still tried to encourage him, I just think that his brain wasn't in the right place... So I waited for him... Until March.20th, we chatted through texts and he told me he has been realizing that I am the one he wanted and how much he loves me, but me not being there drives him crazy, but he would stop avoiding me and he would try to feel better ..... And then we kinda got back together again... Everyday we started chatting a lot again... I thought he was back, I thought my loving and sweet bf was back...  \nUntil Mar.25th, My father contacted me all of a sudden (we didn't talk for 2 years), calling me a loser, a garbage, and told me I don't deserve love etc.. My family is kinda complicated, I was pretty much growing up being denied by my parents. And when J greeted with me, I told him I had a rough day, but I didn't want to bring any negative stuff to him, so I said I would talk to him later. But he said I shouldn't only share happy stuff, he wants me to talk to him... So I talked to him about my father.. He encouraged me to find a psychologist... I was feeling kinda blue, but I never would let my parents abuse me, I always fight back. at that moment I needed Jake's love.. Maybe saying some sweet stuff like \"We will have a good family, don't worry\" words like this,,, So I asked silly question to J, \"Will you leave me again like last time?\" He said no..  \nBut the next day he started to ignore me again... being cold again... then on Mar.27th, he said we need to talk. And I called him, he told me he went to meet his psychologist in the morning and he felt powerless about my family issue, and draining... then he broke up with me....  \nIt hurt me deeply.... I feel being abandoned again... especially I saw him getting a new dating profile on the app we met... And I was really shocking...   \nOn Mar.29th we had a phone call again, he said right now in his brain, he doesn't see hope, he doesn't see future, he doesn't even see tomorrow, and the scary thing is that he doesn't even care anymore.  \nI couldn't help to cry, and I still can't believe thing can change so quickly... I don't know if I should give up... I still love him very much and want him to feel better... But I am not doing well either, I don't know how to move forward... \n\nNow the vaccine is out, the travel ban is about to lift.... we are almost there, but he gave up...  \nIt feels like all my dreamed got crashed....\n\nI don't know if it's possible  to save our relationship...","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"LongDistance","subreddit_id":"t5_2s6ky","subreddit_subscribers":402341,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I don't know how to save our relationship.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.78,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LongDistance\/comments\/mhkpq6\/i_dont_know_how_to_save_our_relationship\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I am very introverted so I get very tired of being in big group of people the entire day.

For example today I had my final presentation for theatre class, yesterday and today I was around people the entire day, to revise. When I tried to go to sleep in my head I was constantly hearing conversations between people that I was around alot that day, they are new conversations that didn't happen, I try to sleep through them but It seems that whenever I almost fall asleep they try to include me in the conversation, by yelling my name, and when I try to sleep through that I try harder to sleep, eventually resulting in my teacher yelling at me to pay attention. I can't sleep like this. Luckily today and yesterday I got to sleep at home, but when I sleep in the same room with someone else, especially with a group, this is amplified, to the point where I have sleepless nights. I have tried meditating and mindfullness to try to learn to ignore these thoughts, but gave up after a few weeks because I was unable to clear my mind.

Because she has already been struggling lately to keep going, her family sucks, my dads family sucks haven't seen them in years nor do I ever want to, my sister got lucky found a good man and got out.\n\nSo I am all that is left for her, but I can't take it much longer constantly knowing that each day I wake up I'll go down the stairs and see what mood she's in and that will decide the rest of my day because she can get so negative and sad and depressed the entire house feels it, do I ever get to voice how I'm feeling? How I feel like crap? No I have to be the strong one, I gotta be the rock, well I'm tired of it! I want a shoulder to cry on! I want someone to hold me and hug me and tell me everything is going to work out in the end cause I'm not doing all this on my own! But no, I can't, because the second I lose it on her is the second she loses herself and breaks fully, I know I'm no doubt enabling her or not helping matters, its a horrible sad shitty situation and I'm not sure how many years I have left before I just lose it and abandon everything to just walk into the woods and never come back\n\nSorry if this is rambling and long and just barely makes any sense and grammar sucks but I just had to do something, before I lose it for good","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"offmychest","subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","subreddit_subscribers":2514069,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Can't take much more","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/offmychest\/comments\/mhktkc\/cant_take_much_more\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I gave up on being happy and shot for content. Because happy doesn't change anything. It doesn't give you want you need in life.\nContent means you can do what you're supposed to and be fine with that.\nAge 6 I was molested and it was buried for years until when I was 11 and it happened again. Someone else this time.\n12 I fell in love with a magnificent girl who later died in my arms from a mugger who got scared our yells for help would be heard.\n14 I started throwing my life away on drugs and booze, any way I could get it. Selling my belongings or body, anything. Then met a girl who cleaned me up, she brought me back from the brink, and made me think it was okay to move on. She turned vile and toxic, beat me into submission when I didn't do exactly what was told of me. The words \"I love you\" became demand, and made me sick to my stomach. She tossed me with the rest of the trash when I couldn't say it back. \n16 I fell into a group of friends that loved the idea of having someone to pick on, viciously and without relent. It felt good to be accepted so I tried not to question. Until they got more violent to the point of breaking my bones. And yet another girl walks in to save me, she stayed nice enough. Until she went into the military and decided she wanted nothing to do with me after 2 years of love and splendor.\n18 I spend most of my time drifting from place to place, house to house, street to street, car to car. Getting high to numb existence. I get into a fling with a girl who turns out to be alot younger than she told me, spent 4 nights in jail until her mother came and pardoned me away from any serious punishment, knowing what a manipulative person her daughter is. And swiftly went back to getting high and being a drifter.\n19 I find it's time to straighten my life out, my grandmother who raised me dies. My best friend since 2nd grade OD'd in a truck. Night Terrors got worse every night, I would wake up screaming. Gunshots still send me into a panic, even the backfiring of a car. Or the stray firecracker.\n20-21 More of my friends and family fade and return to dust, I try to keep my head up, never forgetting the one I failed to protect. Then I receive a phone call telling me that, not only did I have a daughter, but she died in a car crash at 4 years old. I'd done enough sleeping around while drunk or high to know it was possible. I refused to believe it then, and I still don't think I can believe it.\n22 Now I've been having my mixture of problems, financial, mental, my body is worn out and my heart isn't working as well as it should. I've been wanting to die for so long now, and I haven't put in everything that's happened to me. But today just really takes the cake. After shutting myself off since I was 18 from emotional attachment to women or any partner. I met someone who was in every way I loved, perfect. She has her issues, but is so fantastic it pains me to know what she's had to live with and continues to live with. I call her Red, and we fell in love but knew it wasn't wasn't right time. Kept in touch, had fun. She messaged me today, told me she was engaged, for awhile now. And that the last time we kissed was her way of saying goodbye. Didn't have the heart to tell me, didn't want to see the pain in my eyes.\n\nAnd I think I'm finally done, I don't have many excuses left. None that are strong enough as they were to keep me bound here. It's been a long 22 years, painful, destructive, with a stench of death and anger. I can't remember the last time I haven't felt angry. \nI'm tired of feeling angry you guys. I'm tired of misery. The good times I've had fill me with no joy or potential regret of never having them again.\nI'm just so tired.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SuicideWatch","subreddit_id":"t5_2qpzs","subreddit_subscribers":283613,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Throwaway Accnt.

Not new to reddit in general, but this is my first post ever. I went back to school late 2018 or so after initially graduating from a college in 2011. It was a complete career change, but overall I think I made the right decision! I love the things that I'm learning, far more so now because I'm no longer taking the prereqs of prereqs and so on. I'm taking courses that feel like they have true meaning and purpose and it's been fun! \n\nThe main downside I've experienced since going back to school is that it feels FAR more difficult for me to make friends. I'm 31 and everyone else in my program is only just turning 21. And honestly it has weighed on me from day one of being in the school I'm currently in. Without getting too much into a long and drawn out explanation, it just feels as though anyone I try to befriend doesn't seem all that interested. I don't want to believe it's due to my age, but I'm not sure. It certainly doesn't help that I am the kind of guy that is more inclined to be introverted. I don't know. I'm almost done with this part of my life and I feel like I've made acquaintances, not friends. People that, in the next two years, wouldn't recognize me if we walked past each other on the street. Or wouldn't want to. :-\/. It's a bit frustrating to say the least lol. \n\nI don't regret going back to school. Although it was ABSOLUTELY difficult for me to get my head back in the game and adjust to the level of courses I was taking. My GPA was miserable when I first transferred to school I'm currently in. But, like I said I definitely feel like I made the right decision! I just don't know what to do about the whole friends thing...","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"EngineeringStudents","subreddit_id":"t5_2sh0b","subreddit_subscribers":399909,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I'm a student who went back to school for engineering in their 3rd year entering their 4th.
