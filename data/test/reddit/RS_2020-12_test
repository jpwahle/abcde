I'm 22, 5'10, 130lbs, shoulder length dirty blonde hair, pretty blue eyes, naturally long eyelashes, and soft pink lips. My cocklette is 4 inches thin and cut.\n\nI would love to do some RP's that involve you forcing me to be your girly submissive. Mostly interested in serving a Daddy Dom type but would love to see how this one plays out with a Sexy Domme.\n\nMy profile has various prompts but here is one that has been on my mind lately:\n\n*I stood on the sidewalk outside your address... You told me to be there at 11:00am on Saturday and it was 10:15. I was early because I took the bus and didn't want to be late.* *I wasn't doing so well my freshman year of college and as a result, my parents cut my allowance. I didn't go out much, I am very introverted and shy, but I used that money for supplies, food, and some hobbies.* *I saw your ad looking for petite male models. At 5'8 and 120 lbs I was very slim and slender. I had shoulder length dirty blonde hair, pretty blue eyes, naturally long eyelashes and soft pink lips. My face was more towards the effeminate side. I have no experience doing anything like this and mentioned it several times in our email exchanges, hoping you would tell me nevermind. But you assured me that I would be fine...* *I took a stroll around the block a few times. I was dressed in khakis, a white t shirt, and a blue button up plaid shirt.* *At 10:45 I approached your door. I got a nervous feeling in the pit of my stomach. Something telling me I should turn back. But you seemed nice enough via email and showed me some photos which were very professional.* *I knocked on the door and brushed my hair behind my ears...*\n\nAny other scenario you have in mind? Let me know !I'm open to sci-fi\/magic\/realistic...!\n\nMy kinks include: non-con, humiliation, intimidation, SPH, forced gay\/bi, forced femme, outfits, being striped, inspected, dressed, and groped. Love being punished (spankings and other punishments) when I'm disobedient. Love being rewarded with girly items\/praise when I'm obedient. And it gets harder and harder for me to earn rewards as you come to expect my obedience. I love big beer bellied older blue collar guys...!\n\nI also love pet play, age play, maid training, slut training, being lent out, posture training, and teddy bears (hugging them, cuddling them, dry humping them... love to be \"given one\" as a security blanket to hold on to or seek comfort in while you transform me into your obedient little girl).\n\nI can do Reddit PM's to start, but would love to also be able to do a faster RP with Reddit Chat or Discord. Message me for more kinks. I do very much appreciate reference pics for any outfits you will have me wear. This really helps me get in the mood and respond to you more creatively and in depth.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you Strict Daddy Dom types. If this is still up and you're interested, please message me! :)\n\n[https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/caafc6\\_d161fa55515c4ae4b4d933c9188292b4\\~mv2\\_d\\_2764\\_2943\\_s\\_4\\_2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w\\_560,h\\_560,al\\_c,q\\_80,usm\\_0.66\\_1.00\\_0.01\/file.webp](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/caafc6_d161fa55515c4ae4b4d933c9188292b4~mv2_d_2764_2943_s_4_2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_560,h_560,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01\/file.webp)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_subscribers":357269,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[m4A] shy boi for Strict Photographer","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtypenpals\/comments\/k48wzx\/m4a_shy_boi_for_strict_photographer\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

It wasn't what I expected, though I'm not sure what I ever expected anymore, after all, I'm 25. When I was younger I'd planned to lose my virginity with the girl I was dating for almost half a year. We had all these big plans, on valentine's day, and ended up breaking up a week before, over text. We were young (her 18, me 19), and I didn't really see it as either of our faults, though I did spend a long time thinking about why it didn't work. My latest conclusion being we'd put too much pressure on the event, and we were too immature to really understand our feelings, let alone talk about them.\n\nThere's been a few sexual encounters since then, but I have found myself in the bedroom, too nervous to perform, which made me extremely embarrassed, so I spent quite a few years cock blocking myself. My sex drive has never really been crazy. Usually when I fantasize about a girl it's cute coupley stuff, or doing things for each other, not usually sexual acts. For a time, I thought I was asexual, which still scares me sometimes. I want to have a family someday, and  I know there are romantic people who are asexual, but I didn't really wanna put myself in an asexual box and look for something in that world, so I just resigned myself to being single. I still get lonely at times, but I am generally pretty comfortable being alone, and do value my alone time. I wasn't ever closing myself off to a relationship, but I haven't been looking for a long while. \n\nAbout a month or two a girl came into my life, and we've been hanging out more and more frequently, and flirting quite a bit. She'd told me she wasn't ready or looking for a relationship, but despite her uncertainty I could tell we had a lot of chemistry. A week ago, a mutual friend of ours pressured her about us, which led to an awkward couple days of miscommunication where we we're really uncertain, but after a good talk things became more intimate quickly. \n\nShe is far more experienced than me, and very vocal about her past, which has been intimidating, and my virginity is something I've grown ashamed and anxious of over the years. I told her two nights ago that I was a virgin (she knew I had some sexual anxieties, but didn't know what so we'd planned to have a talk). It caught her off guard, but she took it well and was really supportive. She said she really liked me, and didn't want to pressure me, which I was really thankful for. We ended up making out and making plans to hang out the next day and in the heat of the moment she told me she was going to take my virginity tomorrow. I ended up spending the night; we cuddled and made out more, but she had to work so we parted ways. \n\nI went home and I was a little nervous, but I was excited. I did a little general grooming and packed a bag for the night, and went back to her place later that evening. I also took a Blew Chew (Tadalafil) because I wanted to make sure I could perform. We had a really nice night, ordered food and watched a Christmas movie in the living room before eventually retiring to the bedroom. Things were getting hot and heavy, and she was giving me excellent lessons on how to better use my hands and mouth, but any time I thought about putting it in, I'd lose my erection. This was causing me to get in my head more and more, but thankfully she was able to notice this and slowed things down, held me, and got me to calm down. After some time of watching Netflix, talking, and kissing, she took the lead. With her taking the lead I was able to not think, and I just feel for a bit. She made sure I was good the whole time, and put it in herself. The sensation was amazing, and we kept going for a couple of minutes. There was one moment in time where I felt like for the first time I'd turned my brain off, running off pure instinct, and was completely in the moment. It was well worth the wait. She asked if I'd wanted to change positions, but during the switch I got back into my head and lost my erection. I was infinitely more embarrassed than she was. She assured me that it was totally fine, and we just returned to foreplay. We tried a few more times, but my dick wasn't cooperating anymore. After a full nights rest we tried to see if my morning wood would cooperate, which almost worked, but I had to resort to satisfying her with my mouth and hands, a task I am totally up for. \n\nThat morning was this morning and after returning home I got really anxious and had a million thoughts all at once: what if my thyroid problem really has given me erectile dysfunction? What if I actually am asexual and I'll never have a family? What if this is just mental and I'm sabotaging myself for some reason I don't know? I would have thrown up if there was something in my stomach, and had a really hard time regulating my breathing. I've never had a panic attack before, but if someone told me that was one I'd believe them. After a ten minute guided meditation (something I don't do much of), I felt a little better, but reached out to my best friend, who knows everything about me, and gives the best advice. \n\nHe told me that everything was normal, and this kind of thing happens to tons of people (something I know, but I just never believe until he says it). He helped calm the storm and make me feel less like some weirdo for having all these emotions like some kind of human being. He reminded me that asexual and aromantic are two different things, and if I am, I can still have the kind of life I dreamed of. He reminded me that years of anxiety aren't going to magically wash away when my penis enters a vagina.

I'm 24 years old, no priors and have always behaved well.\n\nWell, earlier on in this year during the covid pandemic I had an argument with an immediate family member (parent) who at the time, claimed I spat on them in an attempt to give them covid (I didn't have it nor did I spit on them). Well, when the police were phoned they handled it seriously which is understandable, they took me to the cells and I spent the weekend there only to be left on bail.\n\nWell, once I was released I lived with my gf as to not breach my bail conditions but my parents quickly appealed the bail condition of me not being able to live with them after about 3 weeks and I moved back in, all was well. My parent (my accusor) deeply regretted the decision, made a letter to the PF office (prosecutor fiscal) saying they wanted the charges dropped and here's the kicker, both of my parents refused to give formal statements during the time.\n\nWell my lawyer recently informed me that I have a date (29th dec) where I will be pleading Not Guilty. I'm just concerned and frankly, frustrated with the fact that due to it being a \"covid charge\", it's an indictment (which my lawyer informed me was for serious matters). I just don't know how to proceed, I have a government appointed lawyer who will be having a meeting with me to go over the options soon, but my parents are besides themselves with worry as they do not want to escalate this at all and the person who made the allegation acknowledges that the police getting involved was an impulse reaction which is now potentially, gonna end up with me having a charge (I understand it's highly unlikely as there literally isn't a case. The only 2 witnesses refused to give formal statements at the time and i'm literally living with both on really good terms right now with them wanting to drop this entire thing as soon as possible)\n\nWhat advice can I give my parents to do in order to get this mess resolved?

This included a family who seemed to be suffering issues most commonly known in families in which the family tree has few to no branches... if you catch my meaning.  The second oldest child was a glaring example of this.  In his early teens, he had been in an accident (cause was ruled as unknown, but believed to be attempted suicide), and due to damage to his neck, he had a rod inserted in his neck to help stabilize his vertebrae.\n\nOne day, as I was going through my list of people who needed to be brought across to see my judge who were in jail, I noticed his name, and started to mentally prepare myself.  I had a talk with him before I took him out of the court holding cell telling him if he didn't behave in front of the judge, we would just put him back in jail for a few days to let him think about it.  Getting him to court was easy, no problems.  I had already told the prosecutor's office I was bringing him over, so there was an APA waiting for us when we got there, and I called my judge's chambers to let him know we were ready.\n\nMy judge came out and arraigned the kid on a charge of domestic assault, for physically hitting his girlfriend (yes, he had a girlfriend, and no, she was not genetically related, at least not within several generations).  The judge entered a not-guilty plea and assigned the public defender's office to represent him, and told him we'd be bringing him back in on Tuesday (the day was Friday), as it was the only open docket call day when the PDs were in our court to see clients.\n\nAfter the judge was done making his notes, he handed me the case folder.  I made a photocopy of the docket entry for the jail to update their roster details to know when and in which court inmates were scheduled next.  As I finished, I signaled for the kid to follow me.  As soon as we entered the secured 1st floor hallway, he made a dive as fast as possible into the side of industrial sized filing cabinets which sat along the length of the corridor.  He was trying to break the rod.  He was trying to kill himself.  I immediately got him in a reverse choke hold (not really choking him, just taking physical control of the neck, so if he tried hurting himself again, he wouldn't be able to), then swept his feet from under him and took him to the ground, him on top (he was handcuffed and shackled), so as long as I kept the arm around his neck, I could easily hold him for a very long time, as I was also able to lock my legs above his.  Using my hand mic, I got on the radio and said, \"158, Control, Code Red, Secured Corridor, 1st Floor.\"\n\nAnyone who's ever been in a high risk moment knows that seconds go by like minutes, and minutes like hours.  Before I knew it, I had so many hands pulling the kid off of me, I almost didn't realize what was going on.  Deputies and officers from the jail, detective division, patrol division, another bailiff, and our division chief were all standing above me.  It wasn't a moment like I just mentioned, it didn't seem like minutes... in seemed like nano-seconds.  I was told to stay down, as the jail staff took care of taking the inmate back to the jail, and so the others could check to see if I was injured.  I assured them I was not, that it was a controlled take down, and later was told the inmate was also uninjured.  My chief immediately told me to go take a break, to which I didn't complain.  When he rammed himself into the side of the filing cabinet, he put a large dent in it, so he picked up other charges for destruction of public property and disrupting court proceedings.\n\nAfter being forced to go on medical leave for a bone infection in my neck and the base of the skull, I found out the guy who had been the chief of our division and who took my spot as Judge Waters' bailiff, while I took his job as chief, had an almost similar incident, except his non-compliant inmate was not at all friendly, and didn't care who he hurt or what he damaged.  For a second time, a code red was called in that hallway, after the guy destroyed the button on the wall which unlocked the door to lead into the corridor.  Thankfully it was generally our policy to lock our firearms into the 2 drawer filing cabinet next to us at the bailiff's desk, and the bailiff had done so.  That inmate received much harsher charges, including felony assault on a law enforcement officer, destruction of public property, disrupting court proceedings, and was held in criminal contempt of court.\n\nAlthough I would eventually come back to work, part-time at first for 3 months, then full-time for another 3 months, I was transferred to the jail.  I wasn't there very long before I got injured taking an inmate down after he threatened to jump from the second story to the ground in an attempt to kill himself, all because he refused to lock down after I told him he was not allowed to go upstairs in the pod he was in until after chow was done.  He continued to climb the stairs in his original housing pod, and I asked him, \"Do you really want to do this?\"  My answer was him taking another step up the stairs.  I keyed up my radio and called a code red, which made all the inmates suck in their breath, as I was considered the most chilled, easy going Deputies the department had.  Anyway, after we got him into his new pod for a single man cell lock down, that was when he made the verbal threat.  By that point, all but one of the staff who came in response to my first code red had left back to their posts, only to have to come back for my second call of code red.  For the first 45 seconds, the kid was going at it like his life depended on it.  I'm not a small guy, I'm 5' 11\", weighed 225 lbs, built like a linebacker, and looked like it, especially wearing my ballistic vest under my uniform shirt.  The other Deputy was just a little shorter than me, but weighed about the same, and the kid was tossing us around like crazy... then it happened.\n\nAs we were trying to clear the entry to the pod so we could close the door to it, leaving us on the pod floor common area between all the pods, the inmate's foot managed to step on my boot, I turned right, and he turned left... giving me an instant severely sprained ankle.  Knowing we were going to get our a$$es handed to us if we didn't do something fast, I made the decision to do a leg sweep, which took us down hard onto the concrete floor.  It happened so fast, I didn't have time to warn the other Deputy, and it injured his knee.  Eventually we got more officers on the pod floor, and the jail LT looked at me and said, \"Caplinger, you okay?\"  I told him no, pointing at my foot (I honestly do not remember which one was sprained, but I think it was my left).  He had one of the reserve jail staff who was still hanging around get the jail transport van ready to take both me and the other Deputy to the ER to determine what injuries we may have had for workman's comp.  The other Deputy just had a bruised patella (knee cap); and I had an extremely swollen sprained ankle.\n\nWhen I cam back for work a few days later, I was put on permanent light duty, as the damage to my ankle was the straw that broke the camel's back in my ongoing list of medical issues.  Just a few months later, I had to take medical leave (again), and was never able to return to work again.  I would no longer be able to be a cop, a Firefighter or an EMT.  Am I bitter about it?  Yes, as I loved my job, but you can either accept it and make positive choices, or you can let it eat away at you.  It's a good thing I'm an optimist.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TalesFromTheCourtroom","subreddit_id":"t5_32asi","subreddit_subscribers":322,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[BAILIFF] CODE RED! and how my career ended","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCourtroom\/comments\/k49d95\/bailiff_code_red_and_how_my_career_ended\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

out of a rather long relationship that didn't exactly dive that well into my kinks for a variety of reasons, I would really like to find a (sub) partner with whom I can share some of the rougher kinks I have. For this reason, while I think I know what turns me on, I don't have yet that much of an extensive experience about actually living out all the things I like.\n\nNow, because I don't really see myself diving into something as intimate as this with someone I barely know I am definitely looking for a more long-term, serious relationship outside of this lifestyle as well. A partner that I can trust talk to and have fun outside of our sex life as well. \n\nAs for me, I'm 31, of German-Mexican decent, brown hair and brown eyes, 178cm, and as of this morning 90kg (tendency falling thanks to an abundance of lockdown free time).\n\nI am a computer scientist, hopefully finishing up on that phd, quite the nerd and part-time weeb, I like SciFi, am sometimes obsessed with games, go cycling to free my head, love to go have a party with friends (when there isn't a pandemic raging) and take care of a bunch of bonsais. If you like to play games, that be perfect, as I find it a cool way to get to know people and have fun.\n\nAs for my kinks, I enjoy non-con fantasies, ideally with some choking and am rather on Dom side of things. However, I also sometimes enjoy not having to be in control and while not exactly being dominated at least being cared for. I guess that makes me a switch of sorts. \n\nI filled out [this brilliant kink list](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/i8lUkO9.png), but in brief some of my favourite kinks that really got stuck with me are:\n- anal (you could probably call me a bit obsessed)\n- choking\/asphyxiation\n- rape play\n- DD\/lg (to an extent)\n\nI also enjoy hentai, with the above themes, a lot, so if that isn't something you enjoy or can live with, this might not be for you.\n\nSo, **tldr**:\n\nI'm looking for someone with similar kinks, that could be interested in a serious relationship and would like to talk\/chat a bit.\n\n**Edit:**\n\nJust noticed a small missing thing in the kink list image: I'm also not into furries myself.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BDSMpersonals","subreddit_id":"t5_2smyd","subreddit_subscribers":160064,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"31 [M4F] (West) Germany looking for a sub partner for kink and a more serious relationship","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BDSMpersonals\/comments\/k49gdc\/31_m4f_west_germany_looking_for_a_sub_partner_for\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I have an adorable doggo who is my best friend. I enjoy cooking, playing games, going to the gym, reading (mainly fantasy and manga), and I'm a huge foodie. My favorite places to go out when I go would be to new places to grab a bite to eat. \n\nMy personality in my day to day interactions is stubborn and competitive. I am not a fan of confrontation when I feel something doesn't matter, but if it is a subject I feel confident in or I feel someone else has been wronged I'm the type to argue you all day or step in. \n\nGenerally that is more of a front to hide my submissive side, and I tend to be incredibly sensitive. I honestly just like being told what to do and how to please someone to make them happy. I get an enormous amount of pleasure knowing I'm making someone's life that is important to me easier or better even if it is only slight. \n\nI have been in the fetish for around 8 years, and while I've got the opportunity to expierence some of what I want, I have a fairly large and diverse kink and fantasy list I have yet to get to do. I'm really only interested in having a singular Mistress to worship. \n\nMy limits would include forced bi, black mail, anything permanent. \n\nAs far as my kinks go I am generally willing to try almost anything at least once, and my main source of pleasure just comes from accomplishing what I'm told. My biggest I'd say is foot worship, body worship, face sitting, and bondage.\n\nI'm the type of person that will respond to you quickly and do what you say to the best of my ability. I really enjoy talking and sharing my emotions and thoughts, and being able to have a bit more of an emotional connection is important to me. I need someone that has the time to actually be my dom.

I mean, the way our bodies are creating this life, I am in disbelief. I had never read up on the process in detail and now I am following each week as it comes and reading the changes + growth it bring for the embryo, and I am honestly blown away.\n\nIn my culture women are usually asked to be embarrassed about their pregnancies, don't tell men in your life that you are having a baby, hide your belly, have you no shame. The concept of self care and rest while pregnant doesn't exist, and I have heard this one so many times being thrown at pregnant women 'you are not the only woman to get pregnant or have a baby' \n\nI remember when my aunt was expecting, and was considered high risk. My grandmother expected her to still do all the cooking and cleaning, luckily my uncle stepped in and said she won't be doing any of that. Aunt had a miscarriage earlier that year so they were both very scared about this pregnancy. I was there when my grandmother shouted at them, about how she gave birth to three, while still cooking, cleaning and doing all chores, girls these days like to pretend to be fragile. She looked at my aunt with so much hate and said 'You are not the only woman to get pregnant, so stop asking to be treated as if you are special'\n\nI was barely 12 at that time and I remember feeling horrible about what was being said. I remember how broke my aunt looked. Today, I am 30 and pregnant myself, and I cannot even imagine what my aunt must have felt. How her experience was over looked and how she didn't get the love + support she needed while pregnant. I so want to call her and tell her how sorry I am, for every crap my grandmother threw her away during that time, but sadly we are only 5 weeks and are not sharing the news with anyone else till 8 weeks. My mums the only person who knows.\n\nSo please mammas, don't let anyone discredit your experience, or make you feel like you are doing something mundane. Even if billions of women are making babies, your experience is still unique to you.

Is there anything I'm not taking into account?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the responses. I wanted to clarify a few things and summarize what I've taken away. First, this was never meant to ask if we should move, that is something we are already planning on doing. Also, our move is mainly motivated by a desire to travel and experience new things. It's not really about healthcare or looking for better opportunities. We are also not currently planning on permanently relocating although I believe once we are settled in that could be a real possibility. \/r\/IWantOut seems like it is going to be a very useful sub but I will have to be careful as I would like to avoid the mindset that I am escaping my life here in the states, we will actually be leaving a really good community behind. My biggest takeaway is that the cs job market in the EU is not as ripe as it is in the US, with some exceptions. I am going to try and get some cs work experience before we move, hopefully at a company that has an EU branch. If not I think we are going to focus our job hunt on the Netherlands (market seems a little riper for expats), Switzerland (higher pay and my wife's closest friend in Germany lives in Konstanz), and London (not the EU anymore I guess but no professional language barriers).

I started running around May of this year when I realized I needed something to help get me out of a funk when I was in quarantine. I\u2019ve been pretty sedentary most of my life, so running was something I never thought I would do, but the mental anguish of sitting around literally ALL day got to be too much to handle. So I go to the local fitness store (Fleet Feet for anyone interested; bit expensive but their equipment, including running shoes, are built to last) and purchase my first ever running shoes. I am 26 years old and these past 6 months are the longest contiguous months of consistent exercise I\u2019ve ever gotten.\n\nOf course, running is a challenge; it\u2019s certainly physical, but there is a mental aspect to it that I almost had to break through to get to where I am now. I\u2019ve been running consistently, anywhere from 4-7x\/week for the last 6 months and I still loathe it when I start, but I\u2019m always glad I did it when I end. To put my progress in perspective, I would do a 5k, 50:50 run:walk in about an hour when I first started, to now doing 7 miles (or a 10k on light days) at about 90:10 run:walk in about an hour. Once I get past the first mile, I tend to just get in a headspace, enjoy the scenery, music, etc. and almost coast. By about midway through, the run feels almost as intuitive as walking, as I imagine how walking eventually feels when a toddler is first learning to do so.\n\nAll of this to say that r\/breathingbuddies has had an immense impact on how I view my runs. I\u2019m mostly a lurker, but I\u2019ve learned so much about breathing, centering my breath, and how important the generally automatic task is. I am 100% convinced I wouldn\u2019t be able to run as far or long without consciously thinking about my breath and focusing on it during my runs, and I have this community to thank for enlightening me to that.\n\nI still need to focus on my breathing when I run, but on the plus side, it gives me something to work toward.\n\nTl;dr-you guys helped me to become better at working out and I thank you for that :)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BreathingBuddies","subreddit_id":"t5_12tu2a","subreddit_subscribers":46688,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Whenever I go on a run, I think about this sub","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreathingBuddies\/comments\/k49nyp\/whenever_i_go_on_a_run_i_think_about_this_sub\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I have got three different types of roleplays, but four different scenarios in total. The three types are aliens, robots, and ghosts. I am willing to do other options if you come with a good enough idea as to what you would like to do. I would also prefer it if you could play as more then one person, but it is not required for you to do that. I also have 6 years of roleplaying experience and I am 21. I would also like someone around the same age as me and with the same amount of experience, but if your over 18 that's good enough for me. \n\nHere are my first two scenarios about the aliens. \n\nAfter a long exhausting day of work I start making my way home. Its a normal drive home when suddenly there is a down tree in the middle of it. This causes me to take a detour through the woods. Its dark and my lights are barely able to light up the road. This also forces me to go down a dirt road. As I are taking it slow about half way through I see a blinding green light outside my windows it forces me to stop and brace my hands over my face. The light shinning in from all sides. I am knocked unconscious and it takes me a few hours to come to, but once I am\u00a0 awake I am are greeted with a grey room surrounded by female humanoid aliens. I am straped down to a table unable to move and I am also\u00a0 a little hazy as to what is going on...\n\n\nThe aliens have different hieght to them they are either 8ft or 20 ft tall(height can also be discussed). They have the ability\u00a0 to make you or themselves to grow a penis up to the top of the tip of the person face. They have an overly curvy body much more then an average earth women.. They also have other powers that\u00a0 we can also discuss. They have pink skin and tails along with a long forked tongue.\n\n\nHere is my secound idea. The start of the new year 2021 everyone thought that since the horrid 2020 was over that it would get better. Oh were they wrong the other beings, grey ones, destroy of world is what we called them. Their true name is olmecks. They are aleins that came down and started destroying everything without even a sign or reason. At first we didn't know they were coming, but we soon realized that covid 19 was not man made. It was sent down from them to weaken us so that the taken over off earth was easy. The first thing they did was kill all the males, since they quickly figured out that males have a natural resistance to them and that they were manly the only ones fighting in the beginning stages. Any area under their direct control was turned into a futuristic utopia where the some of the humans stay acting out the aliens orders. The rest the humans stay outside in the wastelands dealing with all sorts of beasts and deadly animals that the olmecks released with some of the monster being biologically engineered and some comeing from there home world. It makes hunting harder since most earth born animals were completely destroyed in the wild and trying to make somewhere to live on the surface will quickly get you found and caught. The world is now back to being unexplored and unknown. The surface was practically wiped out during the war leading to new land masses and flat lands. Other then the new lands and beasts the humans now have to deal with its also the patrolling of the olmeck looking for more to dominate over thats causing even more problems. \n\nThe olmeck are a race expanding from all sorts of sizes. Naturally they are quite taller then humans at 8ft tall, however the taller they are the different stature they hold within society. 8ft-10ft is a normal civilization 12ft-14ft are soldiers they send out to hunt humans 16ft-18ft being royals and 20 ft being the queen of the race. If a queen is born taller or another one is 20ft a battle is made to see who's the next queen.(if thays too much let me know). The olmeck have grey skin and entenas coming from the top of there head. Along with a tail right also the best way to describe there feet is mewtwo feet. \n\nOther then the basics you can make the races look however you would like if be happy to discuss it and go into detail with it. \n\nHere's the one roleplay I have about ghosts.\nI recently bought a house in a nice neighborhood. Its a 4 bedroom three bathroom house. I bought for a steal because the last owners believed it to be haunted. Since that sort of mambo jumbo dosnt really bother me I decided to buy it anyways and move in. The house needs some work to it, in some places its falling apart and in others there are holes and parts missing. I arrive at noon with all my things to move in and even repair it. \n\nThen last, but not least the robots. \n\nThe year is 2232, robot's run a great portion of today's society. The have given mankind what they needed to survive and following under there rule has gotten ride of poverty, famine, and pestilence. However, crime and war is something that not even robots can get ride of and that they can not fall for themselves. With today's war there is rumor that certain robot factions will kidnap humans for whatever reasons. To fight each other like gladiators, to dance and give them Entertainment even pleasure. No one is really certain what the robots due to people. All we know is it must be something that prevents people from coming back. Anyone who dissappear with the robots never come back. \n\nThats all my scenarios I have. You are welcome to make any of these scenarios look however you like. Did give you a good idea of what im like here are my kinks and limits. \n\nMy kinks are: tight clothes, ass, futa, tenticals, giantess, and teasing. \n\nMy limits are: Bloodplay, inflation, and toilet play if you find something else ill be sure to let you know.\n\n\nOther then that I don't really have any limits so go wild and crazy on what you would like to look like and do.

I have got three different types of roleplays, but four different scenarios in total. The three types are aliens, robots, and ghosts. I am willing to do other options if you come with a good enough idea as to what you would like to do. I would also prefer it if you could play as more then one person, but it is not required for you to do that. I also have 6 years of roleplaying experience and I am 21. I would also like someone around the same age as me and with the same amount of experience, but if your over 18 that's good enough for me. \n\nHere are my first two scenarios about the aliens. \n\nAfter a long exhausting day of work I start making my way home. Its a normal drive home when suddenly there is a down tree in the middle of it. This causes me to take a detour through the woods. Its dark and my lights are barely able to light up the road. This also forces me to go down a dirt road. As I are taking it slow about half way through I see a blinding green light outside my windows it forces me to stop and brace my hands over my face. The light shinning in from all sides. I am knocked unconscious and it takes me a few hours to come to, but once I am\u00a0 awake I am are greeted with a grey room surrounded by female humanoid aliens. I am straped down to a table unable to move and I am also\u00a0 a little hazy as to what is going on...\n\n\nThe aliens have different hieght to them they are either 8ft or 20 ft tall(height can also be discussed). They have the ability\u00a0 to make you or themselves to grow a penis up to the top of the tip of the person face. They have an overly curvy body much more then an average earth women.. They also have other powers that\u00a0 we can also discuss. They have pink skin and tails along with a long forked tongue.\n\n\nHere is my secound idea. The start of the new year 2021 everyone thought that since the horrid 2020 was over that it would get better. Oh were they wrong the other beings, grey ones, destroy of world is what we called them. Their true name is olmecks. They are aleins that came down and started destroying everything without even a sign or reason. At first we didn't know they were coming, but we soon realized that covid 19 was not man made. It was sent down from them to weaken us so that the taken over off earth was easy. The first thing they did was kill all the males, since they quickly figured out that males have a natural resistance to them and that they were manly the only ones fighting in the beginning stages. Any area under their direct control was turned into a futuristic utopia where the some of the humans stay acting out the aliens orders. The rest the humans stay outside in the wastelands dealing with all sorts of beasts and deadly animals that the olmecks released with some of the monster being biologically engineered and some comeing from there home world.

Knew I was different from a young age. Didn't however know how to verbalize it. Growing up in a small southern town in the 80s and 90s is not a safe place if you will for even being gay which is what I came to think I was. Except I was always and still am attracted to women so the confusion was real. I looked and sounded like a guy but always felt like I didn't fit. I was attracted to pretty much anyone which made it more difficult to understand what I was.\n\nEventually I married a woman and was with her for about 10 years. We divorced and I decided to have relationships with men again but they always felt a little off. I felt a little off and soon realized a lot of gay men didn't like my feminine side. Like it was too much for them. That made me even more confused. I still felt like I wanted to dress and look like a woman but I had also always had weight issues. Drinking problems, depression, bpd, and dysphoria made it truly hard to cope. I even attempted suicide at 32. I was at my lowest point in life. I was a fat, divorced 32 year old woman trapped in a body that every time I looked at it felt wrong. I felt almost like I was just moving through life but not actually living it.\n\nFast forward to now and I've finally decided I have to transition to be me. It's been a very tumultuous few years. I've come out to my uncle and his husband, my brother and his wife and my mother. My mother is the only one who knows just how deep these feelings are. I had to explain to her it isn't the same as being gay. I'm not a man but a woman that likes all sexes.\n\nSo I feel confident and happy about the future but also stressed. I don't at the moment have any idea how I'm going to be able to financially afford everything. The idea is at 40 you have your look. You're put together and here I am like a damn jigsaw puzzle that's just been unboxed. It seems so daunting but I'm determined to liklve the next 40 years of my life as the person I know I am.\n\nI've started a diet to help me lose weight and exercising for a more feminine shape. I have a slightly receding hairline and thinning hair that have both halted in the last 7 years or so. I guess that means minoxidil or hair transplant because I want real hair. I also don't know what to do about style. I'm 41 so I dont think I should dress like a 20 something but I don't want to look like an old lady either lol. I've been doing some voice training and think eventually I will get surgery for it but I don't know.\n\nI unfortunately live in my hometown again so I cannot be going out in public here. Maybe if I was younger but I don't feel bold enough yet to start hrt or know if it's going to be right for me. I have to admit seeing as I'm still interested in women I'm not sure if hrt is the right thing. The idea of having srs actually makes me feel good about myself but having had this body for 41 years makes decisions about this so hard to make.\n\nI have an okay job. It pays the bills and if I'm frugal I can save 500+ per month. I nearly own a home and in a few years if I haven't saved enough by then I will be selling my home and moving to a more friendly environment. At least then I'll have cash flow to do what I want.\n\n\nThis is all so daunting but I'm determined and every time I think about how I've finally accepted myself and who I am I feel a sense of calm. Hopefully I can make some friends and keep others along the way. Any tips or advice you can give would be awesome especially if you are a woman around my age. \n\n\nForgot to add any tips for someone that is 6'1 is also apprecitive. I know women come in all shapes and sizes but I am self conscious about my height. I guess it's about just owning who you are \ud83d\ude0a. \nThanks for reading. \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"trans","subreddit_id":"t5_2shbb","subreddit_subscribers":174008,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Finally accepting myself and feeling a little overwhelmed (in a good way)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.75,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/trans\/comments\/k49po3\/finally_accepting_myself_and_feeling_a_little\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I was there when my grandmother shouted at them, about how she gave birth to three, while still cooking, cleaning and doing all chores, girls these days like to pretend to be fragile. She looked at my aunt with so much hate and said 'You are not the only woman to get pregnant, so stop asking to be treated as if you are special'\n\nI was barely 12 at that time and I remember feeling horrible about what was being said. I remember how broke my aunt looked. Today, I am 30 and pregnant myself, and I cannot even imagine what my aunt must have felt. How her experience was over looked and how she didn't get the love + support she needed while pregnant. I so want to call her and tell her how sorry I am, for every crap my grandmother threw her away during that time, but sadly we are only 5 weeks and are not sharing the news with anyone else till 8 weeks. My mums the only person who knows.\n\nSo please mammas, don't let anyone discredit your experience, or make you feel like you are doing something mundane. Even if billions of women are making babies, your experience is still unique to you. You are growing a life inside you, savior the moment, enjoy the feeling.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"offmychest","subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","subreddit_subscribers":2512710,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"You're not the only woman to get pregnant, stop feeling special","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.8,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/offmychest\/comments\/k49xse\/youre_not_the_only_woman_to_get_pregnant_stop\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I know my experiences are valid, but I also know that mine will be a lot more minor than many others who post here. That said, I also know that we share a lot of traits and family culture so I feel very comfortable in this community.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRelevant background:\n\nMy family has a big history around not talking about things, particularly drug related things. When I was young and fresh out of the DARE program and would bring it up they (60F, 60M) would gaslight me and say they weren't smoking pot. I wrote a suicide note explaining how lonely I was because my parents were always outside smoking pot and my parents found it and said it was just teen angst. They would wait until I was in a room away from the back door before they went out to smoke. They never discussed it and it was pretty clear that I wasn't to discuss it either.\n\nNow that it's legal, my mom in particular is acting like I'm very stuck up and that I'm the reason we don't talk about it. She's only ever smoked in front of me once when I was 18, but now they are hardcore into growing their own plants and sanctioned off half of their basement. They allude to it more and more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy current issue:\n\nI told my mom that I couldn't find any Christmas cards I liked so she invited me over to make some with her. I was delighted because she never wants to spend much time with me and gets agitated when I'm over for more than an hour or so, likely bc she doesn't smoke in front of me. She said super casually something along the lines of \"I'm gonna have to smoke though\" and my brain froze and I just said \"whatever\" and she said \"cool.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm very worried now. First of all, I despise second hand smoke. I don't next to anyone who smokes, it's disgusting to me. I hate the smell. I hate the coughing. I hate that I will have to go home and shower and clean everything I wore. Gross.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven deeper than that, I feel like just saying it's \"whatever\" completely absolves her of all the absolutely shit she put me through growing up - I won't go into the details but let me fucking tell you there have been years of therapy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so angry with her still, but I can't have a frank discussion about it because:\n\n1. The history of gaslighting - I know she won't hear anything I have to say.\n2. She loves to call me stuck up and I don't want to put myself in a position to be judged by her again.\n3. She cannot handle any form of criticism.

I am now in college and am now looking to get back into getting some clubs for Christmas. I am 6'4\"\/6'5\" and am unsure of the whole golf club buying process and so after browsing the internet for a while, I decided it was best to go to my local Golf Galaxy and see what the experts would recommend. The people at the store recommended going through the fitting process and so I coughed up the $49.99 to get a club fitting done. After trying out a few things, I was told I needed a +1 inch shaft, jumbo grips and a +4 lie angle. All makes sense so far. The guy set me up with starting an order for Ping G410 irons. For the whopping $630-$1000 dollar price tag of these beauties(630 for the set of 5, all the way up to 1000 for the set of 8), I said I wanted to think about it for a while. No doubt I need the extra length and loft (39\" wrist to floor), but my question is, for someone who is just getting back into golf, is the G410s in the realm of \"beginner\" type of clubs or is this all a sales trick to get me spending more? And if so, can I get away with getting one of the smaller sets, maybe the 5 or 6 club set? Looks like I'll also need to go back and get a driver fitting at some point as well as pick up a putter so I'm trying not to blow the bank while still getting a quality product.

This is my fourth pregnancy (missed miscarriage between #1 and #2) and I have felt so confident. I was talked into the Harmony because of my age (36) and was relieved that all 3 trisomies tested for came back low risk. My fetal fraction was 16% (there's a decimal there but I can't remember) and Harmony reported 1\/10,000 chance for all 3 trisomies. I went to my 20 week scan feeling very confident and got a call back that the doctor who reviewed it saw a \"thickened nuchal fold\" and no other issues\/markers (nasal bone, long bones, heart, etc.). At that point, I was 19 weeks. I was called back in for a Level 2 Ultrasound at 21 weeks, where I learned that the nuchal fold is measuring 7.5 at its highest and that after scouring the heart, digestive tract, kidneys, etc., they cannot find any other issues or markers. Now, I guess I'm kind of just wondering why they called me back at all. Do they not trust the NIPT? The doctor I spoke with said it's highly accurate, though obviously not 100%. I am also now booked for a fetal echocardiogram in January. Is this because they think it's likely the baby has Downs? I understand that many children with Downs are born with heart defects. Thanks for any light you may be able to shine on this. I have found lots of information online saying that the thickened nuchal fold is correlated with Downs, but nothing about how often it is found and leads to a chromosomally typical baby.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"NIPT","subreddit_id":"t5_2ap2ow","subreddit_subscribers":1165,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Curious About Down Syndrome Odds","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.88,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/NIPT\/comments\/k4afts\/curious_about_down_syndrome_odds\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Your feedback has been very helpful and reassuring.\n\nWhat a rollercoaster! Since late October, I have had random bouts of anxiety, chest pressure, back of head pressure\/headaches, trouble sleeping, pins and needles in my hands\/feet, feet falling asleep feeling, elevated heart rate while running etc.  \nI was originally diagnosed with hypothyroidism in 2013 and was medicated until I stopped taking my medication this past year. I'm 29 and very active (runner) and I hadn't felt any ill effects till I think everything caught up with me. I first had a TSH of 4.5 at the end of October when I had my first panic attack and now I finally got my blood results back showing a still high 4.3 TSH and Free Direct (S) T4 of 1.56. I think my Endo kept thinking my symptoms were just a hyper swing of hashis, but I tested negative for antibodies. In the meantime, I've been dealing with these symptoms while still being unmedicated. I've had a CT scan, an MRI of my head, 3 EKGs etc., all clear with no issues. \n\nAm I going nuts or is my TSH aka hypothyroidism causing this stuff? Even back when I was diagnosed, I never had a TSH higher than 2.9, and now I've had 2 results over 4 in the last month. My BUN levels were on the slightly lower end, but I think that's also because my bloodwork was done at around 11AM.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Hypothyroidism","subreddit_id":"t5_2s0tv","subreddit_subscribers":27035,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"New Lab Results~TSH 4.3!","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Hypothyroidism\/comments\/k4anea\/new_lab_resultstsh_43\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

The light breeze felt good on my lower body, especially where it mattered. I immediately noticed all the eye candy on display as some looked back at me with the occasional wink or lips licking directed at me. The golden sand stretched on for a good while but I was able to find a good spot soon after undressing. My 10 inch cock was semi-erect as I caught some sun.*\n\n*The hot sun shined on my fit, naked body as I took a towel out of my bag and placed it on the sand. I sat down on and looked out to the blue sea that reflected the blazing sun. I looked around briefly, checking out a few girls who I could take on in one of the many lewd activities that would let me have some fun with them. I smirked at the thought of it as I checked out the various activities on display: Lewd Island Exploration, Sex Fighting, Oil Beds, this was no ordinary beach.*\n\n*It was a good day to relax but an even better one to spend all day having fun with someone....maybe you. *\n\nHey there! This is my prompt for a nude beach which revolves around us, two strangers who meet on the beach and fool around with the many activities that the beach offers before going back to your beach house for some \"R&amp;R\" though not in the conventional way \ud83d\ude09. I'm very open to any ideas you might have for the rp so feel free to share them. \n\nJust to give you a little bit of info on myself, my names Josh, I'm 20 years old and from Ireland. I'm usually a dom but I don't mind being a sub for certain situations. \n\nKinks wise I'm generally limitless aside from a few obvious ones like scat, rape, piss, gore, vore, vomit and torture.\n\nMy kinks include: I have a pretty big foot fetish (your feet by the way), furries, anthros, sluts, milfs, nerds, goths or emos, big tits, busty figures, femdom, threesomes, rough sex, cum stuffing, light bondage, outdoors, oral, ass play, flexibility, excessive cum, teasing, details, flirting\/dirty talk, kissing, licking, biting, scratching, hair pulling, race play, wet sex, showers, confidence, romance, oil play, clothing and long srps. My main kinks would be the foot fetish, flirting, kissing, teasing and flexibility.\n\nSo if you read the whole intro then you'll probably wonder what all those fun little activities were that I mentioned. Well don't fret because I'll tell you what they are right now. \n\nSex fighting has us in an arena on the beach wrestling with each other to dominate the other. You have to get three points to win the game and the winner gets to do whatever they want to the loser. You get a point if you stick your dick\/clit in your opponent's mouth and make them suck it for 10 seconds or more.\n\nLewd Island exploring has us and other teams of two exploring an island near the beach that in the centre has a hammock that the winners get to relax by and have some fun. I haven't worked out all the kinks for it but we can come up with stuff when we get to it.\n\nOil beds is just a relaxing area to wind down, with smooth latex beds filled with oil to mess around one. Maybe you could give me a rub down by sliding on me before we fool around or something.\n\nAgain I'm open to ideas for other activities because I love to get creative with this kind of stuff. \n\nI really hope you're interested. If so then DM me or message me on kik at TheosK1. If you have any further questions then be sure to ask me. If you have any suggestions or ideas for the roleplay then I'd love to hear them! I'd really like this to turn into something long term if I find the right partner so maybe that'll be you \ud83d\ude09 or you're just really horny and wanna have some smutty fun haha. Either one is cool with me \ud83d\ude1c\n\nThanks!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DirtyKIKRoleplay","subreddit_id":"t5_3kem5","subreddit_subscribers":39688,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M4F] [Nude Beach]","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DirtyKIKRoleplay\/comments\/k4apkj\/m4f_nude_beach\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

isn't your usual story here.  I was not 18 or drunk or had some magical 14-way.  I met my husband in high school and we have been together since.   I'm 5'7\", petite, brunette with dark eyes, former soccer player.  I have like no boobs haha, but I always have a trim mid section and a  shapely butt.  He's 5'11\" with dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, and is reasonably fit.  He never really works out but plays rec baseball and soccer which keeps him active.  His dick is just fucking perfect for me: cut, 6.5, and not too thick.  We were each other's first everything.  We went to the same college and after graduation got married.  Our sex life was always pretty normal and vanilla.  We were like rabbits as teenagers and college kids, figured out our likes and dislikes etc.  Never anything too kinky beyond spanking and hair pulling.  He always has had a much higher libido than me but says I've always kept him satisfied despite my many no's.  With jobs and whatnot it slowed down to a few times a week and we were closer content with that.  2 years after getting married I became pregnant and that's where things got interesting (don't worry, nothing icky, I told you this wasn't the same usual thing.)\n\nSo when women get pregnant morning sickness can be non existent to horrid and mine was horrid.  I couldn't go to work or even leave the bed on it's worst days.  I tried every home remedy and vitamin with no luck.  He was an angel through it all getting whatever I needed. One of the days in this hell he was sitting on the bed stroking my hair before he had to go to work (god I love him so much) and we were just chatting about this and that.  The topic of our month long sexual hiatus came up and I told him I felt so guilty we haven't been able to do anything because of how I felt.  He laughed and said \"don't worry, I'm gonna come at you like a freight train when we get over this.\" I remember this exact phrasing because I suddenly felt something I hadn't felt in a month: horny.  Of course the slightest motion in the bed had my stomach in knots so sex was out of the question.\n\nI told him if I could I would rock his world and that I missed being intimate with him.  I could already see him starting to grow through his pants.  I knew for a fact the poor guy was the most deprived he's ever been in over a decade since we took each others virginity.  I see this grin start on his face and ask what it's for.  He told me I'd get mad if I told him.  I insisted.  He said he had \"heard\" that a home remedy for morning sickness was swallowing the cum of the father.  Asshole.  He was right.  I was mad.  Words were exchanged.  Emotional words.  He apologized, admitted while he had definately heard it he did have ulterior motives.  And then we just sat there for a moment.  His bulge was still there.  In half desperation and half guilt, the words that started me on my new sexual journey were \"fuck it, if it helps I'll swallow every drop you've got.  Let's figure this thing out.\"\n\nHis face lights up like a Christmas tree.  \n\n\"Really!?\"\n\n\"Really, take it out.\"\n\nWe spend the next few minutes figuring out how to prop my head up on the side of the bed so he can carefully and gently put his dick in my mouth without shaking the bed.  What followed was one of the worst blowjobs in recorded history.  Constant stopping and readjusting killed the mood over and over again along with my restrictions.  Despite it all he mercifuly cums and it is so much I can't keep it all in my mouth.  It is to date his biggest load ever in my book.  I almost puked but manage to get what I could down with the rest ending up on the bed and floor.  I'm wiped and the smiling lovable idiot is late for work now and regrets nothing.  We agree cleanup can wait.  I roll over.  He changes and is off to work.\n\nI take a nap and wake up a new person.  Headache, nausia, loss of appetite, and dizziness are all reduced, the most since they started actually.  I am stunned as I sit up like a normal person again.  I don't care if it's science or a placebo or the last hopeless attempt of a pent up man to get some.  It actually worked more or less.  I look over and see the mess.  I look in the mirror and see his dry cum on my face.  This was the only time in my life I regretted not having a dildo because I masterbated to what had happened like a DJ at studio 54 fresh off a foot long line of coke.  My first orgasm in a month was one for the ages.  I had been pent up too after all and came very quickly and haaaaard.  After catching my breath I took a nice long shower and for the first time took stock of the morning.  If all I had to do was blow my husband and swallow his cum to be back to normal then I was on board.  I know he won't complain, no man would hahaha.  Hell I usually do that anyway from time to time, all I had to do was up the frequency by a lot.\n\nI got out of the shower feeling like a million dollars and see my sweet hubby had texted to check on me.  He has no idea.  A plan is hatched.  I play it cool, saying I think it MAY have helped a bit. I tell him I'm gonna try and nap after some toast and see if that helps.  He has no idea how lucky of a man he about to be.\n\nHe gets home the usual time and comes right upstairs to our bed to check on me just like usual.  He has no idea.  Let me paint a picture: every day in recent memory you come home tired and underappreciated from work.  You have a sick, sometimes bed ridden wife waiting for you to get home so you can refill he water and get her more crackers.  You do so dutifully and happily with the hope that this is temporary.  You climb the stairs, walk down the hall, turn the corner and look at the bed.  Where you expect to see the stained sheets around your lump of a wife you only see a freshly made bed.  You look a little farther into the room and you see me, my hair done, makeup on, standing in my robe.\n\n\"Honey!  You're up!  Feeling...\"\n\nI drop my robe and am now completely naked.  You start to mumble something else out of your mouth but before you can get it out I walk over and kiss you.  You had a twix on your way home apparently.  It is deep, long, and passionate.  I pull back, look in your bewildered eyes, and tell you to stop talking and fuck me like that first weekend in the dorms.  I then walk over and climb on our bed, stay on all fours, and playfully wiggle my ass.  He had no idea!\n\nThank god I was really wet because after taking all of 3 seconds to get undressed I could feel his head right at my opening.  After only a moment of playful teasing he went full length in with no warm up or fore play all the way inside me.  It hurt but I dealt with it because I missed this so much and it also felt reaaaaally good.  He clearly missed this too.  He was going to town on me and pounding as hard as he could.  I didn't remember him feeling this big.  It still hurt but I didn't care as long as this didn't go too long.  I could tell he was thankfully getting close after only a few minutes and I was ready to do a few firsts for both of us.  I tell him \"I want your cum, cum for me\"  (a first, I wasn't a dirty talker then.)  After a few more pumps he tells me he's gonna cum (he told me after that that dirty talk sent him over the edge) and I (a first) fall forward out of his hands, spin on my knees and take him right in my mouth.  I actually time it almost right and after the first burst hit my cheeck I take him in my mouth and pump with my hand every last drop of cum I can.\n\nThis time nothing is wasted.  I swallow everything as he groans in ecstasy.  I also for the first time taste myself on him (a first, duh) and I don't hate it like I always thought I would.  I even keep sucking after he stops cumming and he has to pull himself away from me (another first.) As he kneels in our bed panting I do one last first for us as I look him in the eye and scoop the cum that is on my cheeck into my mouth a swallow it, licking my fingers clean too.  His jaw is on the floor as I collapse into the bed both proud and exhausted.  I had overdone it but didn't care at the moment.\n\nWe cuddle and have a long conversation about the day.  An amazing conversation that goes on and on about sex, our relationship, money, parenthood, careers, and of course, what we now call my new cum fetish.  I love him with all of my heart and showed it by waking him up the next morning with blowjob.  His load was obviously much smaller and it took a good amount of work but I never suffered morning sickness another moment after that and our relationship has never been better.  Whatever happened that day made me thirst for his cum.  Maybe it was just a habit we got in and never broke or something special deep inside me awakened?  I get about 2 loads a day now depending on our lives.  Sometime more, sometimes less.  Sometimes they need to be quick no hassle affairs while other times we get to take our time and savor every second.  We have had a mountain of intimate firsts since then.  I have become his cumslut.  My gag reflex checked out years ago.  I have learned to deepthroat, be face fucked, scoop and eat his cum out of me, licked cum off of us, squirt, ballsurf, have multiple orgasms per session for BOTH of us (didn't know guys could do that,) no hands, ruined orgasms (not my favorite but a nice change of pace occasionally,) and a couple times actually cum just from blowing him when I'm reaaaaally I to it.  I leave you with this thought, I got so horny typing this out I did a paragraph while riding him, can you figure out which one it was?  I will happily go into other first stories if people like this.  Thanks for reading!\n\nEdit: Ballsurfing is when a person deepthroats all the way down as far as they can go and then opens more to lick the balls while still deepthroating.  It is not easy ;)","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t your usual story here.  I was not 18 or drunk or had some magical 14-way.

He said he had &amp;quot;heard&amp;quot; that a home remedy for morning sickness was swallowing the cum of the father.  Asshole.  He was right.  I was mad.  Words were exchanged.  Emotional words.  He apologized, admitted while he had definately heard it he did have ulterior motives.  And then we just sat there for a moment.  His bulge was still there.  In half desperation and half guilt, the words that started me on my new sexual journey were &amp;quot;fuck it, if it helps I&amp;#39;ll swallow every drop you&amp;#39;ve got.  Let&amp;#39;s figure this thing out.&amp;quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His face lights up like a Christmas tree.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Really!?&amp;quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Really, take it out.&amp;quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We spend the next few minutes figuring out how to prop my head up on the side of the bed so he can carefully and gently put his dick in my mouth without shaking the bed.  What followed was one of the worst blowjobs in recorded history.  Constant stopping and readjusting killed the mood over and over again along with my restrictions.  Despite it all he mercifuly cums and it is so much I can&amp;#39;t keep it all in my mouth.  It is to date his biggest load ever in my book.  I almost puked but manage to get what I could down with the rest ending up on the bed and floor.  I&amp;#39;m wiped and the smiling lovable idiot is late for work now and regrets nothing.  We agree cleanup can wait.  I roll over.  He changes and is off to work.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I take a nap and wake up a new person.  Headache, nausia, loss of appetite, and dizziness are all reduced, the most since they started actually.  I am stunned as I sit up like a normal person again.  I don&amp;#39;t care if it&amp;#39;s science or a placebo or the last hopeless attempt of a pent up man to get some.  It actually worked more or less.  I look over and see the mess.  I look in the mirror and see his dry cum on my face.  This was the only time in my life I regretted not having a dildo because I masterbated to what had happened like a DJ at studio 54 fresh off a foot long line of coke.  My first orgasm in a month was one for the ages.  I had been pent up too after all and came very quickly and haaaaard.  After catching my breath I took a nice long shower and for the first time took stock of the morning.  If all I had to do was blow my husband and swallow his cum to be back to normal then I was on board.  I know he won&amp;#39;t complain, no man would hahaha.  Hell I usually do that anyway from time to time, all I had to do was up the frequency by a lot.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got out of the shower feeling like a million dollars and see my sweet hubby had texted to check on me.  He has no idea.  A plan is hatched.  I play it cool, saying I think it MAY have helped a bit. I tell him I&amp;#39;m gonna try and nap after some toast and see if that helps.  He has no idea how lucky of a man he about to be.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gets home the usual time and comes right upstairs to our bed to check on me just like usual.  He has no idea.  Let me paint a picture: every day in recent memory you come home tired and underappreciated from work.  You have a sick, sometimes bed ridden wife waiting for you to get home so you can refill he water and get her more crackers.  You do so dutifully and happily with the hope that this is temporary.  You climb the stairs, walk down the hall, turn the corner and look at the bed.  Where you expect to see the stained sheets around your lump of a wife you only see a freshly made bed.  You look a little farther into the room and you see me, my hair done, makeup on, standing in my robe.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Honey!  You&amp;#39;re up!  Feeling...&amp;quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I drop my robe and am now completely naked.  You start to mumble something else out of your mouth but before you can get it out I walk over and kiss you.  You had a twix on your way home apparently.  It is deep, long, and passionate.  I pull back, look in your bewildered eyes, and tell you to stop talking and fuck me like that first weekend in the dorms.  I then walk over and climb on our bed, stay on all fours, and playfully wiggle my ass.  He had no idea!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank god I was really wet because after taking all of 3 seconds to get undressed I could feel his head right at my opening.  After only a moment of playful teasing he went full length in with no warm up or fore play all the way inside me.  It hurt but I dealt with it because I missed this so much and it also felt reaaaaally good.  He clearly missed this too.  He was going to town on me and pounding as hard as he could.  I didn&amp;#39;t remember him feeling this big.  It still hurt but I didn&amp;#39;t care as long as this didn&amp;#39;t go too long.  I could tell he was thankfully getting close after only a few minutes and I was ready to do a few firsts for both of us.  I tell him &amp;quot;I want your cum, cum for me&amp;quot;  (a first, I wasn&amp;#39;t a dirty talker then.)  After a few more pumps he tells me he&amp;#39;s gonna cum (he told me after that that dirty talk sent him over the edge) and I (a first) fall forward out of his hands, spin on my knees and take him right in my mouth.  I actually time it almost right and after the first burst hit my cheeck I take him in my mouth and pump with my hand every last drop of cum I can.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This time nothing is wasted.  I swallow everything as he groans in ecstasy.  I also for the first time taste myself on him (a first, duh) and I don&amp;#39;t hate it like I always thought I would.  I even keep sucking after he stops cumming and he has to pull himself away from me (another first.) As he kneels in our bed panting I do one last first for us as I look him in the eye and scoop the cum that is on my cheeck into my mouth a swallow it, licking my fingers clean too.  His jaw is on the floor as I collapse into the bed both proud and exhausted.  I had overdone it but didn&amp;#39;t care at the moment.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We cuddle and have a long conversation about the day.  An amazing conversation that goes on and on about sex, our relationship, money, parenthood, careers, and of course, what we now call my new cum fetish.  I love him with all of my heart and showed it by waking him up the next morning with blowjob.  His load was obviously much smaller and it took a good amount of work but I never suffered morning sickness another moment after that and our relationship has never been better.  Whatever happened that day made me thirst for his cum.  Maybe it was just a habit we got in and never broke or something special deep inside me awakened?  I get about 2 loads a day now depending on our lives.  Sometime more, sometimes less.  Sometimes they need to be quick no hassle affairs while other times we get to take our time and savor every second.  We have had a mountain of intimate firsts since then.  I have become his cumslut.  My gag reflex checked out years ago.  I have learned to deepthroat, be face fucked, scoop and eat his cum out of me, licked cum off of us, squirt, ballsurf, have multiple orgasms per session for BOTH of us (didn&amp;#39;t know guys could do that,) no hands, ruined orgasms (not my favorite but a nice change of pace occasionally,) and a couple times actually cum just from blowing him when I&amp;#39;m reaaaaally I to it.  I leave you with this thought, I got so horny typing this out I did a paragraph while riding him, can you figure out which one it was?  I will happily go into other first stories if people like this.  Thanks for reading!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Ballsurfing is when a person deepthroats all the way down as far as they can go and then opens more to lick the balls while still deepthroating.  It is not easy ;)&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"gonewildstories","subreddit_id":"t5_2rvlj","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/gonewildstories","subreddit_subscribers":561046,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M]y husband is incredibly lucky [F]or this...","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":10,"treatment_tags":[],"ups":2701,"upvote_ratio":0.99,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gonewildstories\/comments\/k42ekp\/my_husband_is_incredibly_lucky_for_this\/","user_reports":[],"view_count":null,"visited":false,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}],"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.gonewildstories","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"k4aqtc","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":false,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_k4aqtc","no_follow":false,"num_comments":0,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":true,"parent_whitelist_status":null,"permalink":"\/r\/gonewholesomestories\/comments\/k4aqtc\/my_husband_is_incredibly_lucky_for_this\/","pinned":false,"pwls":null,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1623094900,"score":65,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"gonewholesomestories","subreddit_id":"t5_28xax4","subreddit_subscribers":8911,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M]y husband is incredibly lucky [F]or this...","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.99,"url":"\/r\/gonewildstories\/comments\/k42ekp\/my_husband_is_incredibly_lucky_for_this\/","url_overridden_by_dest":"\/r\/gonewildstories\/comments\/k42ekp\/my_husband_is_incredibly_lucky_for_this\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}
