Wonder if that one perfection connection is actually out there.  Wonder if you should post again for the who knows how many times now.  Wonder if you don't reply to this post or that one that you might just be missing out on that one connection you've been needing so badly.  All those wonders are why I'm here posting again.  Even though it just feels like I'm living out the definition of insanity.\n\nI've been off and on the AP subs for a couple of years now. This is actually a fairly new account because I deleted my last one swearing that I was done with it for good. Well that didn't last too long as you can see. I've had some success over the years. I've even had some success fairly recently on this new account. But as you can tell it didn't stand the test of time otherwise I wouldn't be back here. But enough success overall to keep me coming back at least. Yeah you know what I'm talking about. But lets hope each of our losing streaks ends here!\n\nI'm a 43 year old married man who who's in EST. I'm 6' tall, 175lbs, fit, handsome and athletic. Professional, clean cut with short brown hair (maybe going just a bit salt and pepper), green eyes and a short neatly groomed beard (also going a bit salt and pepper). I'm willing to share pics very early on because lets face it a physical attraction is just as important as a mental one. While I'm not shallow by any means I've just found that if the physical attraction isn't there, then the mental one doesn't really develop and things just kind of fizzle out. I mean lets be honest though things will probably fizzle out at some point either way though right. These things are great to start but then sometimes real life just kind of gets in the way. But I'm looking forward to enjoying it as long as we can make it last!\n\nI'm looking for something that has a long, slow, steady burn. Someone I can get to know personally and someone I'm attracted to physically. Because my work situation takes me away from home during the week, I do have significant time to commit to a relationship like this. I'll be honest and up front and say that weekends can be a bit tough at times but I connect as much as I can. And my availability during the week I think more than makes up for it! I do work in an office, its a professional desk job which allows me to have access to chatting throughout the work day as well.\n\nI enjoy the outdoors, hiking, fishing, biking, boating. I also enjoy reading, audio books, classic movies and TV, craft beer, bourbon of course, wine and women. I'm successful in life, very well rounded, very well spoken and can carry on a conversation. Meaning I don't just think with my dick. While that may certainly enter the equation at times, its not the end all and be all. I'm looking for something deeper and longer lasting than just some quick sexting for a week or so and then just moving on. Although some naughty fun mixed in will certainly help keep things interesting.\n\nI'm looking for a confident, attractive lady who's roughly my age or younger. Married of course and who is just looking for someone to get to know and have some fun, lively conversation with. I'm ok with this being completely online or would also be open to meeting in person at some point down the road if things work out and schedules can be lined up.\n\nI'm sure I missed something you wanted to know, so shoot me a message and ask away. Tell me a bit about yourself and what you're looking for. Lets see if we can help each other put 2020 behind us and start of 2021 with a bang (because lord knows that's not happening here right now, haha)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"OnlineAffairs","subreddit_id":"t5_346jr","subreddit_subscribers":38274,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"43 M4F - Looking to make you Smile ;)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.6,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OnlineAffairs\/comments\/npgzsi\/43_m4f_looking_to_make_you_smile\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I\u2019ve been having a lot more trouble battling my PTSD and depression. I was doing alright and getting to a better place.\nThen my uncle and his fianc\u00e9 who is severely mentally ill and Unmedicated moved in. She is, to say the least, nuts. My family didn\u2019t want her here but they caved because they always do. My grandparents (who are my adoptive parents) are to nice and let people take advantage of them. \nAround this same time a lot of custody battle stuff happened with my sister. She was currently with us because her father beat her. That whole thing was a shit show too.\nBut my aunt (the fianc\u00e9, they\u2019ve been engaged for 10 years so I guess she is family at this point) is someone I have always seen as a danger to not only herself but others. She gets manic and destroys things, throws things, she held a knife to my uncles throat once. He has been saying she\u2019s getting \u201cbetter\u201d before they moved in but we have known her for 10 years and she has never changed. When she moved in things were kind of okay. She was hearing voices of my uncles ex wife and daughter, and would argue with herself and scream at herself. It started out as something that happened occasionally to all the time. She stopped taking her meds because of it, all of her meds including blood pressure and diabetes medicine along with her psych. It got to the point where she started seeing them. \nMy aunt is a master manipulator, I want to add. She has never done anything for herself. She\u2019s been sucking my unvle dry for a decade and taking advantage of him. My uncle is one of the most stubborn no bullshit guy, and he lets this woman control his life. We\u2019ve always known this but it hasn\u2019t been an issue until they moved in because now my grandparents have to deal with it. He wants them to sign the house over to him and says he won\u2019t pay anything or do anything around the house unless it is. Please note my grandparents (his parents) are in their 70s, and my grandfather (his father) is declining in health and being unable to do things himself. I help my grandparents the best I could but I can\u2019t do yard work such as cutting down trees, building and fixing things, etc. I have never done things like that, and my uncle works in that field and is used to it. I help mostly with the house things over the yard work. \nI also want to mention they\u2019ve been here 4 months and have only paid $1000 rent. He\u2019s a 55 year old man with a good well paying job and makes more than probably everyone in the house. \nI have paid $700-$900 rent to my grandparents every month since I turned 18, all except for this last month because I was out of a job. I am 19 years old woth a part time job. \nHe complains about my grandparents sucking him dry, but he lets this woman do it to him. I feel bad for my grandparents because they have to do everything themselves and he isn\u2019t doing anything, \nThen my aunt is talking about how we\u2019re all going to jail and people are coming after us and shit. It\u2019s fucking wild. She finally called her psychiatrist to get an appt but didn\u2019t even tell her that she\u2019s hearing voices!!! She said she didn\u2019t tell her because they\u2019re REAL!!! And now it\u2019s to the point she was seeing the people!!!  \nI was worried from the start about her doing something because of the voices. She\u2019s had a history of being violent. \nMy uncle is also on coke. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s on anything else but I know he smoked weed and does coke. It makes him VERY angry. I know how he can get but I haven\u2019t ever had his true anger put into me until the other day.\nHe scared me to the core. \nHe was upset because we got things at my store, and my aunt got a shit ton of stuff and played it off like I did. We had to go and calculate the funds a bunch of times. He said I owed $120??? \nWhen I actually owed $56. We did the math and he added things that I didn\u2019t get. My aunt got things for my grandmother, and apparently I was supposed to pay for them. It caused a whole shit show.\nMy uncle lost his shit over $120. He was so angry. He was going off on my grandmother, he was just so\u2026angry. I told him I would get him the money the next day. He was angry because I didn\u2019t get it to him after he got off work, but I was at work and he knew that. He went into the living room and demanded my grandmother give him money since I didn\u2019t. Then he got mad at me and yelled at not only me, but also my friend who had nothing to do with it about \u201cteens not paying their debts\u201d. \nI was like \u201chow am I going to give you the money while I\u2019m at work?\u201d I had the money but had to wait until I got home. \nI was mad because he was so angry over this money, but this man took my dog. (I have a yorki pop that he and my aunt took from me. My aunt held her hostage and never gave her back and my grandparents just let them keep her because it was easier to not fight.) \nAfter my uncle was pissy about the money, I was telling my grandfather that I want my dog back. He can go buy his own fucking dog. He has the money. He lets my aunt go and buy food for $400 at restaurants just for whatever. And if he\u2019s going to be all pissy about $120 from me, his niece\/sister he can give me my fucking dog back. \nHe came in and he was so angry. He snuck up the garage door and heard me talking to my grandfather.\nHe came in so angry, and was screaming at me about how it isn\u2019t my dog anymore and stuff like that. And how it\u2019s none of my business. \nThen he came out again later on, and I\u2019m pretty sure he was high. Because he was angry. He came into the kitchen, and he shoved everything on the island into me. He came around to me huge, angry. God he was so angry. He was screaming at me and I couldn\u2019t even understand him because I was focused on his eyes and his red face. He was going to hurt me.\nMy grandmother yelled at me to get away. She told me to run. And my grandfather got between us. \n\nHe was going to hurt me. He was going to hurt me so bad. His family. \n\nMy grandfather yelled and told him he needed to find a place. But then my uncle gave back the money for the clothes and said he\u2019d pay rent and do stuff around the house. \nI\u2019m scared to be here. He assaulted me and I\u2019m scared. He hasn\u2019t talked to me. He\u2019s gave me nasty looks, flipped me off. \nEverytime I leave I\u2019m anxious he\u2019ll be outside. Everytime I come home I\u2019m anxious. I\u2019m scared he\u2019s going to hurt me. \nAnd I don\u2019t know what to do. \nI had such a nice happy and loving home until now. Everything was great. And now here I am, no money saved and a job that\u2019s to shittt to even think about living on my own. I also don\u2019t have my own car. I use my grandparents, it\u2019s basically my car but I my grandfather said if I move out I can\u2019t use it. \nSo I have to stay here. Or somehow magically find a car and a place to live and a way to keep a job. \nMy grandparents act like I\u2019m crazy when I say I\u2019m scared\nThey tell me to just ignore him\nBut I\u2019ll never forget the way he looked at me.

After about 4 months of interviews, I ended up having to take a customer service rep role in a call center for a credit card company with the hopes of the possibility of internal movement.\n\nBeing an introvert by nature, this work was soul sucking, so in July of 2019 I snapped and quit without another job lined up. I lucked out and was able to secure an 'analyst' role at a start up within two weeks and thought I had finally broken into a career path; unfortunately for me, this 'analyst' role mostly involved outbound calling individuals to harass them to supply personal information we were required to collect (ID, address documentation, financials, etc.)\n\nAfter 13 months in this position I snapped again, and left with nothing lined up in August of 2020. This time though I wasn't so lucky and have spent the time since unemployed and trying to find a job that is more tolerable (i.e. a job that involves a lot less calling and is more analytical in nature.)\n\nI've hit a point financially where I'm required to take a job to pay the bills (so looks like another customer service rep type role), and I want to know what the best way forward here for me is. I'm 27 years old and realize the clock is ticking and so am trying to figure out the way forward.\n\nIn the long term I'd love to move into a role that is more mentally stimulating and analytical in nature (e.g. risk, credit, financial crime), but am unsure of how to break into this line of work with my past experience.\n\nDo I enter into a customer service position within financial services and just try my hardest to network with higher ups and hope that they like me enough to facilitate movement internally?\n\nDo I try and spin the 'analyst' role and keep applying to other jobs while I pay the bills in customer service and pray that an employer will take the bait?\n\nDo I try both of the above at the same time, or are there other strategies I should be pursuing?\n\nAny advice here is truly appreciated. Cheers.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"careerguidance","subreddit_id":"t5_2t9i0","subreddit_subscribers":332770,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Stuck In Jobs I Hate.

I have to bring it up at some point because even though I'm doing well, it's still a part of my life and I take meds and do therapy. I start talking to someone I like, then start panicking because I'll have to tell them and they'll just dump me anyways, so I stop talking to them. Anyone else with similar issues?

I am 45yrs old, my son is 16 and my daughter is 13. My daughter struggles with depression and anxiety. I am so worried about what this will do to her.\n\nThings have been up and down over the years, and this year has been tough, but I am crushed. Crushed for my kids and dreading what this will mean for them; scared about the future and how I will afford to live on my own (my wife makes a lot more $ than I do); I am flooded with memories of all our time as a couple and a family. I feel alone. I live across the country from all of my siblings and parents. \n\nI am not a perfect person. But anyone that knows me knows that I am a good father, I am a present partner and I have worked over the years to be better man. I work hard, have a good job, and have dedicated my life to my family. Now it's blowing up. Over the entirety of our relationship my wife has refused to ever take any responsibility for our problems.  I have always been the one to just take the blame, so we can make up and move on- and so I could protect the family. My wife grew up with an abusive father who teased and mocked her, and she's never dealt with that trauma, and I believe instead of doing that, she finds things to constantly tell me how bad a husband I am. I know I am not perfect, but by any objective measure, I am a good person and I listen to her frustrations or critiques and try to respond and validate her. There is no space in our marriage for me to express my frustrations. She cannot hear anything from anyone about any imperfections she may have. I think bc this is how she pushed back against her dad. \n\nThe other night she described me as a black cloud in her life.  I am distraught, alone, angry at her, heartbroken. We're still in the house together and I am trying to avoid her, but it's hard. She keeps trying to have casual friendly conversations, which just feels heartless to me.\n\nI could use some advice from people who have been or are going through this.

That being said I have some questions. The first is... is an FD RX-7 (preferably 1993 R1) a reasonable goal\/attainable dream car? For context I\u2019m currently 15 years old (16 in about a month) and getting a job in the trades. With the apprenticeship my pay will start at $65,000 annually when I am 18 years old. I don\u2019t plan on ever having kids and maybe won\u2019t even get married (not because I want the car but generally stuff I\u2019m not really that open to) so I won\u2019t have anyone relying on me for income. I want to put a couple thousand away for savings each year and another $1200ish a year for charity. Other than that I\u2019m still going to be living with my parents for a long while so I won\u2019t have to pay rent or bills or anything. My second question is would it be a smart choice to get something cheap like an rx8 or FB RX-7 to learn how to maintain and work on rotaries before getting an FD? If something goes wrong while I\u2019m earning I\u2019d much rather it happen to a cheap car I got off fb marketplace rather than my pride and joy car. Another question is would it be a reasonable goal to get one by the time I am 25 years old in 2029 or 2030ish latest (hopefully earlier if I have the opportunity and cash)?

All my life she was so worried about me and my sister and every single thing we did, even my best friend who knows my whole family and loves my mom, once told me \"your mom is a little...much sometimes...I feel that she doesn't leave you be and do things your way, like she always wants to be watching you and judge what you're doing\" and she said it in the nicest way possible not wanting to hurt my feelings but she was totally right. The partners I've had including my husband, all loved her too because she's considerate and selfless and will do anything for you, but they all said at some point that my mom is kind of pessimistic and often says negative things that hurt me when it's really not necessary.\n\nI know she's had a rough go. My dad put them in serious debt, and she is basically the caregiver to her parents who selfishly refused to move out of their large two story home when they had the chance, to make things easier. She has to clean their house, their huge yard and front yard, take care of everything for them and cook for them on top of caring for herself and my dad who also has quite a big handicap. Edit: I've helped her cook, do groceries and clean for my grandparents many times. But if I did this every single weekend like she does, I wouldn't have a life. I'm 30 years old and my life is just beginning...\n\nHOWEVER she was not always in this type of situation. Even before all this crap, every time I did something, or wanted to do something, or talked about my opinion on a topic, or whatever, she ALWAYS had something negative to say about it. And because of this, I've questioned every single choice I ever made and I have trouble making my own decisions. \n\nMy husband is away on a military course for 4 months and we want to take turns traveling to see each other. I told my mom that I was going to drive up there (3 hour drive) for the weekend and she just had shitty negative things to say. Like, why would you drive all the way there just for a weekend. Why doesn't he just come home for the weekend again. Why do you have to go, why do you have to sacrifice yourself. I also asked her, when my husband and I move 3 hours away for a couple years so that he can work an important contract in the military, if I can come home once a month and stay at her place. All she says is, yeah right, you're never going to come home to see me, all I'm going to say to you is \"see you in 2 years, have a nice life\" ...verbatim..... like what the fuck? Seriously? I literally see her and my family every weekend I can. Literally I drive there or they come to my place every weekend. And now she's making me feel like I would never think of visiting her if I moved 3 hours away. Like I'm that kind of shitty fucking daughter who would just abandon her family if I move 3 hours away. She has said this kind of shit about every thing I've done in my life. When I told her I wanted to quit caffeine because was making me feel sick and anxious, the first thing she said was \"thats extreme, one coffee a day is fine.\" And the worst part is that she has since quit coffee herself. It's like she has to question EVERYTHING and does not trust ANYONE or ANYTHING. \n\nAnd I know she has this attitude because she was screwed over by my dad and will never make another sacrifice for him again. And my grandparents who can't do anything alone anymore but have this big house that my mom has to tend to on top of her own. But what the fuck is up with making your daughter feel shitty and feel like anything she does in her life is going to suck?! Making me question if I'm being selfish??? Like because she has been let down in her life, it's my job to just be there for her and do everything she prefers me to do. I've told her several times that her negativity makes me feel awful and it makes me feel like I can't do anything right. It makes me feel like the only thing she would accept is if I were to move back to my hometown (Its a 25 min drive from where I live now.....) and live near her forever and just do everything her way. I say this because she has made comments like \"why don't you buy a house here instead. Why do you have to live in the next city over.\" Like I'm very aware that this all stems from her own insecurities and her own issues. I know. And I feel bad that she hasn't had the best time lately. But I don't want to be like her. I don't want to be stuck in situations that could have been avoided and be bitter about everything. And it makes me incredibly sad that I don't want to be like my mom. The only aspect I strive to be more similar to is her selflessness and her willingness to do anything for her family. But then again, giving TOO much of yourself to people is not good. I love my mom, I really do, and we have such nice conversations sometimes and we hang out, and its wonderful. But then she says shit like this and pretends like she's not hurting my feelings. And I have to remind her that she doesn't decide if she's hurting my feelings or not.\n\nI know this was super long. I don't even expect anyone to read this far. I really needed to get this off my chest because it drives me crazy and makes me feel really depressive for days. I don't want her to be upset about my choices. I want her support. I want her to be happy for me. And I want her to be happy for herself. But she can't and it affects me so much.

Recently I've been reading and researching autism and wondering if I was misdiagnosed. I made a list of symptoms for my therapist but for some reason I'm nervous to show her. \n\n**Burnout?**\n\n\\-headaches, fatigue, irritability, anxiety, sleeping too much\/\u00a0 too little, feeling numb\n\nAwkward in conversations\n\nWhen comfortable with somebody (ie alice or ian) i have a tendency to **overshare** or talk too much, either about self\/ feelings or a topic, usually animals or politics, i\u2019ll go off on a tangent for a while before noticing, even when the other persons talking i have a tendency to continue thinking about that thing or a different thing in my head, interrupt a lot on accident\n\non the other end of that I have **issues keeping up a conversation** and knowing what to say, when I\u2019m nervous I think a lot about what I\u2019m saying and what I\u2019ll say next\n\n**Stimming?**\n\nBiting nails, sitting criss cross, rocking back and forth side to side, fidgeting with jewelry, restless feet, kept fidget toys at work, always sit criss cross, count steps, chewing hair and shirts growing up, self harming to self sooth in middle school\n\n**Anxiety over time**\u00a0\n\nPanic about being late, get irritable when people move slow and there\u2019s a timeframe, hate it when other people are early \/ late, freak out when there's stuff to do in a certain time period. Also can break down over changes in plans (ie Bonnie showing up that one time)\n\n**Emotional Sensitivity**\u00a0\n\nExtremely sensitive to criticism, what people think of me, small things that shouldn\u2019t matter much get to me a lot, things going on in the world will make me severely depressed, I often feel frazzled and need to go off and be by myself, don\u2019t like jokes being made about things that upset me, I feel like I feel a hundred different things a day sometimes. Day is ruined if I see roadkill, recently had a breakdown from it\n\n**Sensitive to sound**\n\nTrouble focusing\/thinking and remaining calm with loud sounds, particularly unpredictable ones like sirens and leaf blowers, sounds can trigger anxiety and rage, stores scare me a lot because of this (and bc general anxiety). I also really dislike tight or uncomfortable clothing\n\n**Executive Functioning**:\n\nGetting something started (procrastination) then staying on task\n\nShort term memory issues, forgetting appointments\n\nDecision making\n\nI would mess things up at work (hopdoddys) a lot even though I was doing my best\n\nNot processing words even while trying to listen in real life and in videos (need subtitles)\n\nHave to read something over multiple times to absorb it\n\nNeed to make lists if i want to get anything done\n\n**Dislike of change**: Particularly around **hygiene routines** and how my **apartment** is. If something is out of place I can\u2019t relax and might freak out. I can\u2019t just use a different product. Everything has to be organized in a certain way.\n\n**Social Issues**\n\nHated sharing as a kid. Once punched somebody for trying to use my shovel as a toddler. Still hate sharing food and stuff like that. I always felt on the outside growing up. Had a very small circle growing up. When with friends in specific classes I was very eccentric and bubbly and loud which I haven\u2019t been in years. In other classes where people weren\u2019t nice or I didn\u2019t have friends I would stay silent from crippling social anxiety and fear of judgement. Can\u2019t handle disagreeing and will get aggressive in driving my point. I don\u2019t know when to stop talking or what\u2019s okay to talk about. Seventh grade I was 95% mute all year and wore the same outfit everyday. People tell me I\u2019m very opinionated.\u00a0\n\n**I feel like a child**\n\nBecause of emotional sensitivity, inability to do things without help, personifying objects ( if there\u2019s a piece of cereal left I\u2019ll think how it got left behind from its family ) I\u2019m extremely attached to my 100+ stuffed animals and could never throw one away, when I see something alone in a store I think it\u2019s lonely. I\u2019m really codependent on my boyfriend and mom. My mom schedules everything and reminds me to do things. When Ian and I have a fight I think he\u2019s going to break up with me, when someones mad at me I think they hate me.\n\nI don't catch most sarcasm, when it\u2019s something that sounds like criticism I shut down. I feel like I don\u2019t understand a lot of humor or why it\u2019s funny.\n\n**Shutting down:**\n\nLaying on the floor, not moving, not responding verbally, disassociating, this happens after an overwhelm of emotions, sometimes during an argument, sometimes just out in the world\n\n**Meltdown:**\u00a0\n\nScreaming, biting, scratching, crying, feels like a panic attack, often followed by shutting down\n\n**Copying others**, sometimes it feels like I\u2019m playing a character when I\u2019m not comfortable around someone. I feel like I mimic the people around me subconsciously.\n\nOften panic over fear of being a narcissist because I struggle to truly empathize.\n\nScored 22 on the Empathy Quotient quiz","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AspieGirls","subreddit_id":"t5_2rvg9x","subreddit_subscribers":2902,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Wondering if I was misdiagnosed","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.72,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AspieGirls\/comments\/nphou2\/wondering_if_i_was_misdiagnosed\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

My tics have put me in the emergency room and are definitely disabling for me.\n\nI've done a lot of research and know that a service dog is a good option for me and I have a list of tasks one could preform but I'm not sure if now is the right time. Anxiety worsens my tics a lot and being around lots of people makes me more anxious but I've been able to avoid that the last year do to quarantine however in August I'm going back into in person school which will mean a lot more anxiety especially since it's a new school where I know no one. So I'm trying to decide if I should start talking with my neurologist now about  a service dog and start looking for prospects or should I wait to try more treatments.\n\nAlso I have talked with my mom about a service dog and she thinks it's a good idea but I haven't yet talked with my dad who I live with most of the time.\n\nI posted this r\/servicedogs the other day and got a response that was helpful but didn't quite answer my question.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"service_dogs","subreddit_id":"t5_2v0po","subreddit_subscribers":18654,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Tic disorder service dog","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/service_dogs\/comments\/npht5c\/tic_disorder_service_dog\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I want to take things slow, and have a real relationship.\n\nI'm born Male, but I don't care about pronouns because gender is absurd. I'm 25 years old, and I live in the Chicagoland area, and I'm currently spending the week in Evanston and northern Chicago. Fully vaccinated.\n\nLife has been super stressful for me lately. I'm trying to figure myself out on several levels, but part of what's going on in my life is that I'm grappling with some trauma from having lost two people to covid in December.\n\nI've got a small group of very supportive friends, but as the person on the outside of their polycule, I'm just being frequently reminded of how single I am. All of them are so happy with themselves, or interested in me in a way that I'm unsure I can reciprocate, that I feel like it's really hard to talk to them about it.\n\nThat's further complicated by the fact that I want to be able to explore intimacy with one of the men (to better understand my sexuality), but I'm often finding it difficult to figure out what that entails, or where I feel comfortable, or any number of things. It's complicated. After having been on the receiving end of a thankfully unsuccessful, but no less traumatizing, sexual assault attempt when I was younger, I've got this big thing about needing consent and I feel insecure when it isn't clarified or restated periodically.\n\nOtherwise, my friends in that polycule are helping me to try and tackle my anxiety around crowds, and get me on my feet. They were helping me make a start towards a career in performance, either acting, dancing, or singing, despite that I had no idea how to start. Other than what my current situation is, I'm a really weird person with a lot of hobbies and other interests, and generally a huge nerd. Steven Universe, most of Disney, anime, Kipo and the Age of the Wonderbeasts, Dungeons and Dragons, assorted Video Games, etc.\n\nI'm generally a nerd who likes to talk about things, as listed above, and just about any type of crafts.

F Give us a general description of yourself. Physically?- I'm 5'5, about 145 pounds, hazel eyes and a buzz cut.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?  Sensory Overload which is diagnosed and treated as anxiety.\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nOh boy.  I was an overly sensitive child.  If someone looked at me sideways, I'd feel like crying.  My home was verbally volatile.  I saw my dad as a loud, foul-mouthed bully and my mom as a manipulative meddler (though, I didn't put it in those terms back then).  I wanted to be nothing like them when I grew up.  I used self-injury (SI) to mold better behaviors in myself at the start of about 12 years old.  If I made anyone angry or sad, I retrained myself.  Likewise if I showed others those emotions.  (I had a list of many rules, but those were the most important).   I was to be compliant and kind at all times.\n\nBy the time I was 17, I was using SI more to ground myself than for retraining.  I would rather a physical pain distract me from an emotional one.\n\nMy homelife wasn't a religious one, though I got my family into a church for a couple of years when my dad was stationed in Puerto Rico. (When I was 7-10).  Religion and spirituality was always extremely important to me.  When I was about 4, I was saying my prayers with my grandmother (whom I only saw during the summers) and I asked God to make the devil nice.  She chuckled and said I couldn't ask that.  It made me angry and was the start of my quest.\n\nI studied countless denominations, was Wiccan for a time, was a general spiritist and gave tarot card readings to people and interpreted their dreams.  I wasn't satisfied though and kept looking.  Then, when I was about 25, I found my congregation for 8 years.  It's still where my heart is and I'll return one day.  Finding the answers to my questions seems to have been more important to me than living it which shames me.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI was widowed almost 2 years ago.  I'm living off a trust for about 6 more years.  I've never had a real job and I fear I would do terribly in any job market (either performance wise or with my own emotional stability).\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI'd love it.  Solitude doesn't phase me one bit.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI'm a homebody.  I like binging shows and Audible (crime, zombies, thrillers, sci-fi).  I crochet or make things with plastic canvas needlepoint if I need something (a new blanket or e-cig lanyard etc).  I love video games.  I play Merge Dragons (lol), Clusterduck, Magic Puzzles etc on my iPad and 7 Days 2 Die, Valheim, Dragon Quest Builders 2 on my PC.\n\nI prefer open world games that let me do my own thing, build stuff and survive and fight monsters when I get bored.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI've gotten exceptionally lazy with age.  External forces or my body drive my curiosity for the most part.  I think I'm very curious... but I learn and forget.  Any knowledge I take in tends to be superficial and too easily forgotten.\n\nMy curiosities vary wildly- from grammar to history, tech, home repairs and improvement to how could I perform a  tracheotomy on myself if I'm home alone and find myself choking to death :D\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI never want to be in a leadership position.  Obligations and expectations are too weighty a thing that I would sooner just avoid.  I tend to fall into the role of counselor and mediator- though those are almost nearly as tiresome.  I don't like emotional displays or politics.  I'd rather just play Devil's Advocate and be on my way.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI'm not particularly coordinated.  Not nowadays anyhow, with Vertigo bouts and all that.  When I was a kid, though, I loved showing off by balancing across the top of the monkey bars.  I was always climbing and in trees back then.  I'd climb by \"walking\" up the item with my bare feet and hands.  \n\nI also love exercising with stripper poles- climbing, spinning, hanging upside down lol It's great exercise (I recently bought myself one but haven't put it up yet.  I've not used one in 20 years so I'll probably just break my neck!)\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI started writing novellas and poetry when I was about 12 years old.  I created my own written language (over 300k characters) that began at the same age until my first born destroyed many, many pages of the first volume- at which time (around 19yo), I never touched it again.\n\nI write songs and lyrics but I don't know how to actually read or write music, so I just record and save them.  I can play basic songs on a piano, clarinet, flute but I play by ear and make frequent mistakes.  I've never been coordinated enough for chords.\n\nI'm now collecting a lot of my late husbands antique glass collection (\"art glass\").  I'm uneducated about methods or even famous people, so my appreciation of art is superficial.  If I'm drawn to it positively, then I like it.  I don't care for a lot of abstract art but surrealism has it's appeal.  Mostly, I'm drawn to fantasy scenes- giant mushroom forests, alien planets and so on.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI try to live in the present.  The past can't be changed and the events of my own past (good and bad) shaped me into who I am today, so there's no point fretting or idealizing it.  The future causes me too much anxiety to think about.  Too many variables.  It's easier to just bury my head in the sand and pretend the future will always be far away and unobtainable.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI automatically grumble.  First and foremost, I am lazy.  Anything that pulls me away from my chair and computers is a thing to be avoided and put off.  But, I give in because I have to.  Either my kids (adults- 2 out of 4 still live at home) or pets need something and I'm their only option.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nIt's preferable.  If something doesn't make sense then I have to play detective to try to get to the truth of things.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nIf I'm driving, I hate waiting in traffic or traveling in circles.  I'll drive back roads in an orderly path.  I wish I was productive, but I'm not.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nNot any more.  My kids try to.  \"Mom, can you do me a favor?\" to which I reply \"Probably not\" lol.  But I live in a carefully crafted and maintained isolated bubble or insulation.  If I'm around others, they will control me.  Part of it is that childhood reconditioning (the reason I exist is to be used by others because I can take it), part of it is bad self-image and conflict avoidance.  Another reason the idea of having a job scares me.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nGaming, binging shows\/audible, crafting.  If I didn't enjoy them, I wouldn't do them :P\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like\/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nThe worst part of my personality.  I have dyscalculia (self diagnosed in my 30's!).  I need to SEE a speaker as well as hear them in order to take in info (nothing wrong with my ears).  I also need to take tons of notes.  And after all of that... I'll still forget everything in record time.\n\nBooks are the worst because it's too ??? information dense and disconnected.  I prefer seeing how information can be applied.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI tend to take in an overview then wing it... though if I have to assemble something, I frequently look at the guide.  I guess, I'm somewhere in between.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI have none lol.  I just want a quiet, peaceful life.  I hope my kids will move out one day and that I'll return to my congregation, but other than that, I've thought too little about it.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nUncertainty.  Chaos.  The perceived emotional displays of others (I'm compelled to \"fix\" emotions).  Drama.  Meddling. Gossip. Profanity for its own sake. Gore for shock value only.\n\nAll of those things make me uncomfortable.  I hate when some is bullying or oppressing people.  It's the only thing I'll truly stand up to.  All of those things are self-centered though.  \"I\" don't like to be gossiped about or manipulate or bullied, so surely it's a \"bad\" thing that must be avoided or fixed because others would feel the same way.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nTaking care of business- cleaning and organizing my new home; being creative and studious.  In other words- a once in a blue moon occurrence :\/\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nSleeping way too much.  (a monthly ordeal) Relapsing into SI for some trivial emotional crap. (been 2 years)\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI don't have aphantasia, but I might as well.  When I daydream, it's audible only with occasional flashes of some hazy image.  I can still disconnect from my surroundings when I give in to them though.  But, I tend to tune out my surroundings regardless.  My basement (where I live) is a pigsty, but if I stay in my chair and not focus on the mess, then the mess doesn't exist :P\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI'd go to sleep.  I hate being idle.  I'd start out writing a story or song in my head; but with nothing to save it on, I'd give up because the idea of losing it would be too saddening.  I'd also spend some time trying to see pictures in the swirls or designs of the room (wood grain, paint splatterings, even floral prints- I'll pick out images in such things if there's nothing else to captivate me)\n\nIf I had to spend days or longer in such a room, I'd get much more creative out of desperation.  I'd smash up rocks to use as a chisel.  Once the insanity set in, I'd start making poop sculptures. \n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI'm indecisive as heck and my decisions are seldom set in stone.  I'll look into multiple options and directions and take in different accounts and reviews\/advice from others before charting my course.  If someone comes along halfway through with something better, I might change my direction or decision.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI logically process my emotions as soon as they make themselves known.  I do everything in my power, though, to keep from feeling them.  I acknowledge them, address them when possible, then send them on their way.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nI'll agree with others to keep the peace.  As my life is now, I'd see the person for just a short time before I could scamper off to the safety of my basement.  No sense making the time with the person a stressful thing.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI speed.  But I normally only go 5-10 mph over the limit.  Other than that, I'm not a consistent rule breaker.  I understand the need for them.  I also understand the need of others to question and challenge them.  That's not me though.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MbtiTypeMe","subreddit_id":"t5_m1ah5","subreddit_subscribers":13724,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Completely Lost","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MbtiTypeMe\/comments\/nphyf6\/completely_lost\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

My driving rehab therapist thinks once I do get on the road, I might be restricted from driving on highways and basically anywhere that has a high volume of traffic. So basically, city streets and back roads for me. I'm also going to be limited to an automatic since I lack the coordination for a manual and I'll be using hand controls which makes a manual pretty much unfeasible.

I know that's general lol\n\nThe car doesn't need to be super reliable, I just want a car that can get me from A to B in a 20-mile radius.

I actually want something a little attention-demanding that I can learn how to maintain.

I started March 18th, the day I met with a diabetes counselor. I had been diagnosed two months earlier and had been depressively binging for basically 3 weeks straight prior to that day. The counselor was talking about starting me on a 2nd medicine to get my blood sugar down further, and it really was a good wake up call for me. I'm 33 and already on max dose of one diabetes medicine, and now I needed to start another? It sounded to me that unless I changed, I was going to have to start on insulin sooner rather than later. And that is something I want to avoid for as long as possible. \n\nSo now 75 days later, I've gotten my fasting blood sugar down from the 400s to 180. That's still high, but I'm also 339lbs so I think there is room for improvement as I continue to lose weight (I've also lost 30lbs since that day March, 61 all together since Nov 1st). \n\nTo be honest, I credit my beetus medicine with helping me stop binging. I'm on Metformin and Trulicity, both of which are supposed to work as appetite suppressants. But for me they really especially work to kill my constant cravings for carbs and sugar. I no longer have that voice in the back of my head telling me to binge on everything NOW.  \n\nMy life is so different now, especially as someone who struggled with binging for the past 6 years. I used food for any kind of emotion-- stress, boredom, sadness, celebration, etc. I was absolutely obsessed. I went from 230lbs to 400lbs during that time. And now suddenly I just eat like 2000-2300 calories a day and it isn't a struggle to stop. For example, I had McDonald's today. Not exactly diabetic friendly, but I have one day a week of \"normal eating\" to keep myself happy. I had 6 out of the 10 nuggets, 2\/3s of the fries, and 2\/3rds of a small strawberry shake. I didn't finish it all because I felt full, but more importantly I felt content. \n\nBecause as a binger, you know that feeling 'full' doesn't stop you from eating more. But what I had eaten satisfied the craving I was having, I didn't want to eat any more and so I just tossed the rest. Like that is insane, who is this person I've become? So yeah, I definitely think being diagnosed with diabetes saved my life.

I'm 27 atm, luckily never properly self harmed or made an real attempt at curbaining myself. I've been through anger management, grief counciling, regular counciling and congnative behavioural therapy.\n\nI've never been diagnosed with anything properly through through my own behaviour I'd argue I'm on tract with bipolar narrcisitic tendancies. Everytime I've gone to therapy it's been the same kind of repeat of oh \"oh these are my issues\", talk through them \"these are some ways to work around that\", \"cool I've been doing a, b, C, D for years.\", \"well those are the steps you need to take\", sessions upon session build a good rappor, make whoever the person whose \"qualified\" start laughing with me about my issues sessions stop 'clean bill of health given'. \n\nMaybe it's just my experiences but I've always interpreted trying to describe how my mind works with these people like trying to explain colour to the blind. Since my mother was diagnosed with cancer (now dead) I've always used humor, confidence and bravado to get through life and the darkness cause I've found it works well as a defence mechanism. Yet I think especially when it comes to professionals because I'm not in a fetal position or lost and need finding, it's assumed \"I'm okay\". Yet if this is \"okay\" then what's \"bad\"?\n\nI'll be honest I haven't seen a shrink since before the pandemic and those sessions ended with me nonchalantly saying \"It'll be great to get rid of the constant pressure of existential dread I deal with on the daily\" and my guys face cracking unsure whether I was joking or being serious and me looking at him like wow this has been a waste of both our times hasn't it?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"depression","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqqf","subreddit_subscribers":765055,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Anyone actually see the point in therapy?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/depression\/comments\/npi8eh\/anyone_actually_see_the_point_in_therapy\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}
