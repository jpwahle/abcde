He had his gym kit so I invited him to come to my house after school so he wouldn't need to walk so far to play. He was up for it so we got on my school bus to go back to my house (he gets on a different bus usually)\n\nNow, he's very... eccentric. Me and him like messing around a lot, goofing around doing silly things and we figure since it's not hurting anyone it's no problem. There's 4 kids who get on the very back of my bus, and I sit just two rows ahead. Now I'd call them acquaintances, with one being the acception as being a friend. I don't really talk to them on the bus but I'm cool with them, we used to all be friends but drifted more as high school went on.\n\nAnyway, we're sitting on the bus, two rows ahead, just talking and laughing like usual. I could tell that they were starting to laugh at how silly my friend was being but it didn't bother us, until one of them slaps him across the back of the head. He turns round and just makes a joke about it and we laugh, but they just start laughing at him. that part didn't really bother us, but then they hit him again, and chucked a bag at his head. Our stop was just coming up so he turned round and asked what their problem was and they just laughed, and we got off the bus.\n\nAs we talked to my house the thought of them essentially bullying my good friend got me more and more vexed.. but there wasn't really much I could do at the time. Also, the fact that one of my other friends unofficially (he just started getting on a different one) moved buses because of them doing things like throwing things at him, I was really annoyed.\n\nSo, here's the part where I need some advice. I'm not sure what to do, and I'm worrying what you guys think would be the best approach.\n\nAt the moment I'm thinking of just swallowing my nerves and going to them on monday to explain what they did wasn't a nice thing and if they could apologise to my friend. If they, which I think they will, just laugh and say no, then I'll just go with my friend to the \"pupil support\" section of our school and report the case. Though I'm really fucking nervous about going up to them and asking knowing they'll just be assholes about it. \n\nSo, do you think this is the right way to go about it? Physically confronting them has been on my mind if they don't apologise and mock my friend any other time, seeing as I'm aware bullies tend to only listen to someone physically hurting them and realising it's not worth the effort picking on someone who will fight back, but I'm hoping it won't come to that, seeing as I'd also like them thrown off the bus\n\nThanks, and sorry if this was really long.

So I'm not going to change the details or anything, but I'll use some pretty words so you can enjoy it and understand how amazing it felt!\n\nSo later in the night after the whole incest video had been *accidentally* showed and then somehow went *missing*, I was lying in bed half excited that my dad had possible taken the dvd because it turned him on and half scared because if he didn't want it, it may ruin our relationship for good.\nThat was when I heard a light knock on the door. I wasn't even particularly sure I heard it at first until another there was another, louder one followed by my dad voice saying \"Anna, are you awake?' (My names Arianne, but Daddy calls me Anna). \nI wasn't sure what to do, I was scared he was going to come in and give me the \"I don't want this\" spiel. I swallowed and quietly called out \"yep.\"\nIt was around 3am at this point and the room was icy, as I was only in a over sized t-shirt nighty and my single bed is against a brick wall so it's not very insulated. But I wasn't sure if I was shivering from excitement, nerves, fear or the cold when Daddy walked in. He was only wearing a pair of loose flannelet shorts and his previously toned body (e.g. He was older so didn't have the young body he used to but there was still a reminiscence of a six pack and massive arms lingering on his 6'3\" frame - p.s. I'm a lot shorter then Daddy, I'm 5'2\" with  waist length silver and purple hair - used to be red - 32 DD (not lying about this as I CAN give proof but wont) and around 130 lbs).\n\nHe came over and sat on my bed looking concerned, and really nervous. He had the, I assumed incest, dvd in his hands which he'd placed in his lap. By this point I was thinking \"Fuck, he hates me. I've ruined our relationship. He's probably so disgusted and weirded out\" etc. etc. He was avoiding eye contact which made me all the more scared about our now, what I thought, damaged relationship. This was until he moved the dvd from his lap and was about to talk when I realized he had a huge boner. \n\nBefore he could talk, he noticed me staring and when bright red, then continued with:\n\"Anna, why do you have this dvd?\"\nI just shook my head unable to answer at first, mumbling awkwardly how it turned me on, the whole taboo thing.\n\"So it's not that you're sexually attracted to your Daddy?\" he looked away awkwardly.\n\"Well, I dunno, I guess I sort of am. But please don't hate me Daddy I don't want our relationship to get screwed up because of it\"\nHe smiled shyly, flushing again and said\n\"It's okay little girl, Daddy's not mad\" and started tracing circles lightly on my thigh \"I think I feel the same about you, but if you're uncomfortable with this Anna, we can just forget anything ever happened and move on with our lives\"\nI was starting to get ridiculously wet as his finger moved gently over my upper inner thigh while my legs were crossed and stammered out a \"N..n..no, I want to\"\n\nHe smiled at me so lovingly and moved his finger up to my panty covered pussy and started to lightly stroke my mound, moving down to the clit and gently caressing it over the fabric.\n\"Do you like this baby girl?\"\nI nodded, my eyes closed and mouth slightly parted. Even that light touch was heaven. \nHe moved the panties to the sides and started to stroke up and down the lips, slightly dipping into them feeling the wetness and stroking up and down again. He then slipped one finger into my tunnel and started doing that *come here* motion that makes girls CRAZY. I had leaned back against the headboard of my bed and started to moan softly.\n\"Can Daddy taste you little girl?\"\nI nodded, in too much ecstasy to talk. \nWith that he hooked his two index fingers in the band of my under wear and pulled them off with my help of uncrossing my legs and raising my hips to he could pull them off easily.\nI rested back on the bed and Daddy put his warm hands on my upper thighs, spreading them, and started to plant small kisses on them all the way up to my mound. He then started to lick up and down the slit from my ass to my clit and back down again. I was getting wetter and wetter with each lick moaning uncontrollably.  He started to suckle on my clit with one hand reaching up to fondle my breasts and the other he used for support while repeating the come here motion with two fingers inside me. I came so hard and strong that it squirted over his fingers before he took them out to suck on them and clean all the juices up while be body trembled.\n\nI reached over after this and started to stroke his cock through his pants, it was about 7\" and when I removed it from them I noticed he was uncut. While I rubbed him he started to moan, resting his hand on my shoulder softly gripping my loose hair, then moved down to play with the nipple of my right breast. \n\nI decided that this was the moment, so while his eyes were closed and I was still rubbing, I crawled over and straddled him, one leg on either side. He opened his eyes and looked at me before giving a nod. I then lowered myself onto him, guiding his wet with pre cum head to my tunnel and pushed it in. It pressed at the entrance while I tried to push down and popped in. He groaned loudly and lay back his hands gripping tightly on my hips.\nI pushed him all the way in and started to grind slowly for a while bringing up my speed. Daddy then pulled me up by my hips so I was halfway off his cock and started to ram it inside me all the while moaning\n\"you're so tight baby girl\" and \"you love daddy fucking you Anna?\"\nI came again stifling a scream \"Daddy!\"\n\nHe told me he was going to cum and asked where, and said not in me of course. I told him in my mouth. So I jumped off and sat beside him, leaning foward. I only got the tip in my mouth before he thrusted right to the back of my throat and shot 3 strings of warm cum into my mouth groaning.\n\nAfter he petted my head while I cleaned his off saying \"You're such a good daddy's girl\"\n\nWe've had a talk and want to continue it, we spoke about our feelings and how we want more then just sex. So right now I'm his bed while he's showing and we're going to cuddle and sleep together tonight :3.\n\nEDIT: Want to ask my dad or I questions go here: http://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/za0tv/iama_18_yo_girl_having_a_sexual_relationship_with/","link_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"incest","report_reasons":null,"created_utc":1346539546,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qx19","banned_by":null,"media":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"domain":"self.incest","secure_media":null,"ups":22,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many of you have been following this process and giving some great advice :3.

Some asking around quickly led me to believe that all it needed was the rear suspension pump that often fails on the 190E. I rode a bus to Fife with an envelope containing $2500 in $20 bills in my pocket, and after looking it over, bought it. I got some looks from the office staff when I just handed them an envelope of case.  \n  \nThe drive home was rough, but I kept it at a reasonable pace. The car immediately was backed into the garage, put on jack stands, and work began.  \n  \nInstead of replacing the pump I replaced most of the suspension. All new bushings, and an [H&amp;R Sport Cup Kit](http://www.hrsprings.com/products/cup-kits/). A decision I later regretted. The Touring Cup Kit would have made for a much nicer car to drive. THREE MONTHS after I put the car up on stands, it rolled out of the garage, ready to conquer. I had everything I needed to finish the car a week after I bought it, but was unable to find the upper strut bushings for quite a long while. The dealership, and all aftermarket distributers I called were fresh out. Everyone called me back at once at some point, so I have to assume there was a manufacturing shortage for a while. That three months killed me!  \n  \n$4000 into the car all together with all the pieces and parts I put on, and I was feeling pretty bad-ass. The car was tight, fast, fun, handled amazingly, and turned heads. This car got me laid. Something I had never even considered to be a real thing until I drove this car.  \n  \nOne afternoon I was at a friend's place on a very cold day, and snapped the photo above. I will never forget that photo because it was the very last photo that camera took. One exposure on that cold cold day, and the camera quit. It was my first camera, and the camera that launched me into photography being my life's obsession.  \n  \nLike all good things though, this was not a love that was made to last. There were a number of big show stopping problems with our relationship. The biggest one was that there was not enough room in the footwell for my feet. I am 6'5\" and have size 15 feet. I regularly got my feet wedged in and had to jerk my feet out and find the pedals again. I could drive barefoot, but that isn't always practical. The second big show stopper was that I couldn't drive it up into the woods. I was shooting a lot back then, as well as hunting, and camping. My life as a photographer also tended to take me off the beaten path. This car could not come with me on any of these adventures.  \n  \nAfter six months total of owning this beautiful car, I let her go.   \nI of course lost money on the whole thing, but the real heartache is that I never really got to know her. One summer is not enough time with a car so deserving of love. It was or the best though, as I was able to fall in love but not learn to hate her.  \n  \n","link_flair_css_class":null,"score":13,"author_flair_text":null,"num_comments":20,"retrieved_on":1413612311,"gilded":0,"author":"thumper242","permalink":"/r/mercedes_benz/comments/z7b87/the_story_of_my_86_190e_16valve_cosworth/","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"stickied":false,"thumbnail":"self","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/neotrance\"&gt;Neotrance&lt;/a&gt; asked me in thread on &lt;a href=\"/r/cars\"&gt;/r/cars&lt;/a&gt; to post about my 190#-16 Cosworth.

I had everything I needed to finish the car a week after I bought it, but was unable to find the upper strut bushings for quite a long while. The dealership, and all aftermarket distributers I called were fresh out. Everyone called me back at once at some point, so I have to assume there was a manufacturing shortage for a while. That three months killed me!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$4000 into the car all together with all the pieces and parts I put on, and I was feeling pretty bad-ass. The car was tight, fast, fun, handled amazingly, and turned heads. This car got me laid. Something I had never even considered to be a real thing until I drove this car.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One afternoon I was at a friend&amp;#39;s place on a very cold day, and snapped the photo above. I will never forget that photo because it was the very last photo that camera took. One exposure on that cold cold day, and the camera quit. It was my first camera, and the camera that launched me into photography being my life&amp;#39;s obsession.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like all good things though, this was not a love that was made to last. There were a number of big show stopping problems with our relationship. The biggest one was that there was not enough room in the footwell for my feet. I am 6&amp;#39;5&amp;quot; and have size 15 feet. I regularly got my feet wedged in and had to jerk my feet out and find the pedals again. I could drive barefoot, but that isn&amp;#39;t always practical. The second big show stopper was that I couldn&amp;#39;t drive it up into the woods. I was shooting a lot back then, as well as hunting, and camping. My life as a photographer also tended to take me off the beaten path. This car could not come with me on any of these adventures.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After six months total of owning this beautiful car, I let her go.&lt;br/&gt;\nI of course lost money on the whole thing, but the real heartache is that I never really got to know her. One summer is not enough time with a car so deserving of love. It was or the best though, as I was able to fall in love but not learn to hate her.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","ups":13,"secure_media_embed":{},"domain":"self.mercedes_benz","secure_media":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

I love my dad, he does a lot for our family. But I hate being around him. I know, somehow, he'll find a way to make a situation negative.\n\nFor instance, a few hours ago, our home phones (a set of two: one downstairs, one in my brother's room) were going off. They stopped ringing, so I assumed my dad or mom had picked it up, and didn't bother to get up to check. A few minutes later, my dad starts yelling about how much it pisses him off when people don't answer the phone (me in particular). The phone was actually in his office, with the other one dead in my brother's room. He hasn't been violent with me since I was 11, but he's verbally very loud and hurtful. He called me an 'idiot', and my mom tried to talk him out of yelling at me.\n\nAnother example is before a school trip to France, I asked my dad to send my guidance counselor an e-mail about a scholarship opportunity. I had completed all the necessary applications a month in advance, and just needed a letter of recommendation from a school official. I left a note on his desk with her e-mail and name, reminded him at the airport, and left a note on the fridge. Of course, when I came home, he didn't do it. And it was my fault. He tore up my applications (there were 4 copies), threw them away, and yelled at me about how I'll never go to any college because of how lazy I am in front of my friends. It was humiliating. Then he told me to do all the laundry by the end of the day, because I needed to 'get used to doing manual labor since I'll never get a degree'. I was really hurt, went to my mom to try to talk to her, and she said just let it go. But this happens all the time, with very minor things. By the way, I'm a National Honor Society student involved in 7 clubs with a 4.3 GPA, and I've taken and passed 3 AP classes. So again, I felt really hurt. I work very hard in school. \n\nMy brother, who's 3 years younger, is a star athlete. When he gets to high school, he'll more than likely get many scholarships for sports. But I don't have that; I have to work very hard academically. \n\nI know my dad tries hard to be close. He listens to the same music I do, and goes to concerts with me. He likes taking a lot of pictures of the family, and doing 'family things'. But no matter what, they are negative by the end of the day. It's irritating, scary, and makes me not want to be around him.\n\nI'm a 17 year old high school senior. I do live in an upper-middle class situation, and my parents do buy me a lot of things, even when I don't ask. They're financially very supportive, and I appreciate everything they do.

This is my first time posting here. I have come for some insight and assistance about what I should do with my current situation.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was born and raised Mormon by two converted parents. My pare have always been fairly easy-going and both are democrats, so I have grown up in a fairly accepting household. I am currently in University and living at home, because it&amp;#39;s cheaper. My parents are good people, however, I believe it would break their hearts if they knew i no longer believed in the Church. I am going to wait a while before I announce anything to them. I know I must leave at some point, though. After investigating, I know I can not remain in the Church for the rest of my life; I have never felt the Spirit or receivefld any answers through prayer.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is my question to you helpful people: how do I go about living this unfortunate lie for a while?

My parents are good people, however, I believe it would break their hearts if they knew i no longer believed in the Church. I am going to wait a while before I announce anything to them.

I started on the eu server and now I'm playing on the eune server. LoL is my first moba style game i have played. At the start i didn't even know the basics, but now i have been playing for a long time (for me) and I know much more about the game. I have played around 900 normal games and thought that i will only start playing ranked when I feel confident enough. Today was the day. \n\n\nSo here's the story of my first ranked game: \nI get to the ban screen and, my teem seems polite, and start saying who they prefer to play. I ask if i can jungle and everyone agrees. The bans are usual: Shen, Diana, Morgana, Darius, and some more. \nOur team leader picks Le Blanc, as he/she wanted mid. The enemy team picks Eve and Swain. Our next two teammates pick Jax and Ezreal, the enemy team picks Ashe and Lee Sin. I think to myself that I can deal with lee sin unless they invade, but my mid should cover the entrance, so even when they come to my jungle i can just start wraiths. So I and my last teammate can pick, i ask once more if it is ok for me to jungle skarner, and my team agrees. The last teammate picks Alistar. Enemy team's last pick is Janna. So here is the match-up: Le Blanc, Ezreal, Jax, Skarner, Alistar VS Evelynn, Swain, Ashe, Lee Sin, Janna.\n\n\nWhen the game starts I ask Le Blanc to cover entrance to my jungle next to blue golem. She doesn't. Then I ask Alistar to defend my red buff. Luckily he does.\nOh! What's this? Ezreal is afk? Ok, I hope he reconnects. As Wolves spawn I start attacking them, and Jax is helping me. He is attackinng only the big wolf and i think that he just wants it really low. Nope, he takes it. I wont say anything because I always shut up when I feel the urge to say something bad. We go to my blue, I see eve and start running, Jax gets caught but flashes over the wall and escapes luckily. Well, no blue for me. I go back buy a potion and go to wraiths.Oh, and in the meantime Ezreal reconnected, so that's good.\nWhen i finish wraiths, Jax asks for a gank. I say to him that I can't rigt now, I just got to jungling. Our Le Blanc dies to Swain while i get my red. So there's first blood.\n \n\nFast forvard into 10 minutes. Jax is underleveled and underfarmed against eve, but atleast he doesen't feed. Le Blanc has died to Swain more 2 times, but i got a kill too. I decide to gank bottom, because they seem to do ok. I get a kill on Janna and apologize, because i could've given it to Ezreal. They say no problem and i go farm my jungle. Jax really can't solo top so Alistar asks if they can swap. Jax agrees and goes bot. Then the mid game comes and the enemy team comes to push middle lane. I get there with Le Blanc and we ask bot lane to come there too, because it's 2v4. They arrive on time and we stop the push. Everyone goes back to farming. Le Blanc dies again in the middle and Swain pushes the lane. I see Lee Sin going bot so I head there. I see a good opportunity to pull Ahe into the tower, altough i saw Swain coming. We lose the fight under our tower 4v3 and Le Blanc comes too when she respawns and gets killed too. I apologize for initiating a stupid fight.\n\n\n20 Minutes in the enemy team has pushed our middle inner turret and my team tries to surrend. I say no because i think there is no point surrendering a ranked game. the votes are 3/2 but then Le Blanc leaves so the votes are 3/1 and we lose the game. \n\nSo that was my first ranked game. Sorry for my poor English I'm 15 and English is not my native language.\n\nEdit: I didn't mean to say that this wouldn't be normal, it just made me very sad :(","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","media":null,"created_utc":1346524060,"banned_by":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","report_reasons":null,"author":"[deleted]","gilded":0,"permalink":"/r/leagueoflegends/comments/z6zh0/my_first_ever_ranked_game/","retrieved_on":1413612781,"num_comments":7,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little bit about me: I have been playing since the satart of season 1.

At the start i didn&amp;#39;t even know the basics, but now i have been playing for a long time (for me) and I know much more about the game.

I ask if i can jungle and everyone agrees. The bans are usual: Shen, Diana, Morgana, Darius, and some more. \nOur team leader picks Le Blanc, as he/she wanted mid. The enemy team picks Eve and Swain.

I was one of those kids that treated all his toys as if they were going to be collectables and still have the original boxes for everything like all my Transformers, M.A.S.K, etc.\n\nAnyhow, I have two Star Wars records and a Tron record I figure I would just throw in as well, since it's cool and I figure if anyone on here knew the value of geek collectable records, they would know the Tron one as well.\n\nStar Wars\nFront Cover\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ljUVE)\nInside\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/TGakY)\nInside Left\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/8dod1)\nInside Right\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/q7zHA)\nBack Cover\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/tO6Dp)\nRecord Labels (2 records)\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/6cI2a)\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/GEYnl)\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Z7648)\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ivVg4)\n\nThe Story Of Star Wars\nFront Cover\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/gGMib)\nInside Cover\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/RdQkA)\nBack Cover\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/mo4cQ)\nRecord Labels (1 record)\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/dUnIK)\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/4ulmZ)\n\nThe Story of Tron\nFront Cover\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/F0ycT)\nBack Cover\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/vmXYx)\nRecord Labels (1 record)\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/GU12j)\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/gJeJs)\n\nEdit, I just looked at the posted version of this and I don't know why all the individual items with each picture does not have a carriage return after it.  Nor do I not know why thumbnails are not showing up, maybe that is an RES thing and I don't have RES running on the computer I am on right now.","link_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"StarWars","created_utc":1346522369,"banned_by":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qi4s","report_reasons":null,"media":null}
