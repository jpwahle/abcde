He is my creative partner (we are in a music group together). First noticed that I didn't like the sound of his voice on the song recordings as I thought his voice didn't blend so well with mine (which is fair enough), but then whenever he would talk my mind started to obsess about whether I liked his voice or not, whether it's annoying, whether other find it annoying or not good or whatever. It directly coincided with a period of increased stress relating to our musical project, and I know it's my mind trying to protect me and diverting from issues that are actually important, but it just harms more. I have only talked to a few people about this, and of course have never talked to him about it as I don't want to hurt him or weird him out.\n\nThe worst part about it is the total shame and confusion. I'm sure most of you are familiar with the thought process of \"How the hell can this be troubling me so much, no one is going to understand, it's been going on for months and has taken lots of potential joy, I'm weird, something that is almost infinitely unimportant is going to ruin my life and my relationship with this person I love\". The shame makes things worse. But I trust that many of us have experienced obsessions about utterly nonsensical things, and the isolation when you feel you can't tell anyone. But as we also know, it's always a diversion from something important. However, this does necessarily make the intense pain go away or decrease in a meaningful way.\n\nAs I said, this is just the latest one, have had many different obsessions about 'very unimportant or small things ruining something important', and have normal talking therapy and tried out CBT. However, I see a lot of people talking about ERP (and sometimes ACT) here and have not tried that out. Would anyone here recommend it for what I have described?\n\nThank you very much if you have read this and I wish you all luck on your respective journeys!\n\n**TL;DR** Have been experiencing OCD and anxiety about unimportant yet unavoidable part of very important person. Could ERP or ACT be helpful?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Anxiety","subreddit_id":"t5_2qmij","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Anxiety","subreddit_subscribers":282283,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Hurtful obsession about best friend and creative partner's voice","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Anxiety\/comments\/ckglf6\/hurtful_obsession_about_best_friend_and_creative\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

A good couple of paragraphs is enough! Maybe less - if we're at a mundane stage of the roleplay.\n\n\n- NSFW scenes. I know it's a natural part of any relationship, I would just rather is be *fade-to-black* style. Ie: alluded to, but we don't actually have to write out the scenes. I will do it every now and then if you want to, but mainly I'd prefer fade-to-black.\n\n- Very dark plots. I don't want to be part of the mafia.\n\n- Any sort of OOC photo trading.

I'm 18, I do my best to keep myself mentally and physically well, exercise and I do my best to read and try new things. I am against smoking, drinking, any weed or hard drugs, not even painkillers when they were offered to me years ago after a surgery. I really do believe because of my education and well-rounded experience and personality, that I'll succeed in my career, at  least enough to satisfy me.\n\nNow my friend, would be considered a polar opposite. He was expelled from high school, due to multiple reasons (drug use, vandalism, rude behavior, skipping classes, threats, etc.) He is loyal to his girlfriend, who is currently living off benefits and refuses to work any sort of job, and spends most of her days on Facebook reposting minion memes. He actively smokes, drinks heavily and loves weed. He hates education, learning, or anything a well-adjusted adult would do. Refuses to schedule, behave appropriately, and much, much more. \n\nNow, recently he has had what he *claims* to be as a change of heart. He woke up miles away from home, nearly dead in a ditch after a night of heavy drinking with some sketchy people he didn't know. He spent an entire day roaming around a city he didn't know looking for help, and ended up hospitalized, and left with a ton of fees and payments to make. Ever since that day happened, he says he's changed. He says he smokes less and is trying to quit. He says he drinks less often, and plans to find another job (after he was recently fired for showing up stoned) and staying straight-edge, like me. I personally haven't seen any change, but that's because I'm busy working or practicing for the future (with my career). \n\nI've talked to him many, many, **many** times about how I refuse to have a partner in my career with someone with his behavior, and I'll only do this if he cleans up his act. He has accepted a ton of times, but I believe that he's simply saying what I want to hear. I've done lots of favors for him, drove him around since he doesn't have a car, gave him money, **which he has paid back**, and have talked to him on multiple occasions when he's needed help, I've even offered him to pay for some therapy of he'd like to try it, but he refused. He says he's trying his best, and that he's starting to eat healthier, cut down on his bad habits\/do them less, and has ended friendships with some seriously shady people.\n\nI love him like a brother, but I'm not going to get dragged down with him if he continues to repeatedly crash and burn. I understand that nobody wants to grow up an addict, or a slave to \"do what feels good\", which would be weed, booze and cigarettes in his case. I really think he can do well, and I've seen him before these bad events took place, and I really think he has the skill, if he were to focus on it and get some proper help. I want him to be with me in the future as a partner, and enjoy the better life, one where he doesn't live in a trashy household with abusive parents, being constantly teased with addictive substances. \n\nDo I continue to be a shoulder to cry on for him in hopes he cleans up his act, or give him an ultimatum and let him prove  himself to me, or do I just cut him off? People change as you age, I get it. I'm just hoping it isn't too late for him. \n\n**TL;DR:** My best friend with an extremely spotty and hard life behind him is becoming too much work to care for, and is consistently hitting rock bottom.

I recently moved and just started hosting at a new restaurant. I am 20, and the host I am working tonight is 17.\n\nSo I completed my training though I will yield the iPad\/rotation to whoever has been here the longest. So my coworker, let\u2019s call her Hannah, is in charge and so while she tells me where to seat people (and plays on her phone otherwise), I am left to bus tables. seat, wipe and reset tables, etc. The other hosts I\u2019ve worked with usually split the work equally with me but it\u2019s whatever, I don\u2019t mind doing it all to pass the time. \n\nHannah gets a to-go order over the phone and puts it in. Now typically, you wait until the to-go customer arrives before grabbing it (so that you can help out, do other host duties) but Hannah decides to go wait in the kitchen for ~20 minutes or so until her to-go is ready. Our dinner rush is just ending so people are getting up, and I\u2019m running around bussing tables while Hannah is in the kitchen waiting on that to-go. \n\nI literally have no tables besides the ones that need to be bussed, so I\u2019m making sure no one is walking in and I go quickly to clean some off. \n\nWhen I brought some dirty dishes and cups to the kitchen, Hannah tells me not to bus tables and wait at the host stand (to ensure every guest that comes in will be greeted). Yeah, I get that, but I need tables to seat them at and if they aren\u2019t coming in, I\u2019m going to do my job and bus those tables. But she insists in a more rude than usual tone that I NEED to stay up there and not bus tables, so I say okay and stand up the host stand. I play on my phone, text some friends, browse reddit, the works. No one comes in. Meanwhile, soooo many tables are getting up and need to get bussed. My manager comes up and lets me know when Hannah gets back up there, I\u2019m cut and free to leave. Literally 30ish minutes from when she first left the host stand, Hannah comes back up with this tiny to-go order and realizes the restaurant is a mess. I let her know I\u2019m cut and clocked out. I am gone now lol \n\nTL;DR: hostess with \u201cmore experience\u201d tells me not to bus tables despite the dinner rush being over and no one coming in. I get cut and leave her to bus a dozen horribly messy tables.\n\nEDIT: being cut means being free to clock out and go home. Restaurants rarely have specific out times.\n\nUpdate: Spoke to another coworker over text about Hannah and he let me know that the managers have been aware of her laziness and behavior for a while, which is why she is usually only scheduled 1 or 2 shifts a week (which she had complained to me earlier in the night). We\u2019re really short on hosts so I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s why they don\u2019t fire her. The servers I was working with all saw me bussing like crazy before the to-go order when she was still up at the host stand on her phone and a few of them actually helped me out and thanked me, so I feel like even if Hannah was to speak up, I have enough people to back me up.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MaliciousCompliance","subreddit_id":"t5_3boqz","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/MaliciousCompliance","subreddit_subscribers":850994,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Other hostess wants me to stay at the host stand and not bus tables.

The comment thread quickly devolved into *many* commenters saying things like...\n\n* Anyone who doesn't congratulate a coworker on a pregnancy \"hates mothers\"\n\n* If you don't participate in collections, i.e. GIVE MONEY, to pregnant coworkers, then you're not being supportive of them\n\n* That it's not ok to feign joy for a coworker; you have to actually *be* overjoyed at a coworker's pregnancy, not just feign it (I'm totally willing to fake it, but I think it's *insane* that apparently a lot of professional women think that's still not enough)\n\nThe really gross part is how one-sided it is: in reality, people generally do NOT congratulate coworkers for anything else, like graduating or buying a house. I'm 2 weeks away from finishing my MS and when I mentioned this, none of my coworkers said anything more than \"ok\" - I was certainly never congratulated. We have an intern who officially finished her BS degree last month, she was already working here at that time and no one congratulated her either (except me, but then she sits right behind me lol, she is super awesome and tomorrow I actually am training her on a new system).\n\nSo apparently you have to fake - no, actually *feel* - overjoyed for a coworker's pregnancy...but when you buy a house, or finish a degree\/school, they don't have to give you the time of day.\n\n(Even outside of work, on a personal note, not a single one of my friends congratulated me on my sterilization. Not one was even happy for me. No one even asked how my recovery was, (it was fine) or if I feel ok (I was fine). Yet when they get pregnant, I will be expected to foam over with joy for their pregnancies.)\n\nThis is why I stopped reading Ask a Manager.

Now, to stand on his money requires, at least, 2 stacks of bills, one for each feet (supposing Uzi has great balancing skills). Let's say these are 100 dollars bills. Ok, between 6,6 feet and 5,4 feet there are approx. 36,5 centimetres. So there's two stacks of 36,5 centimetres, which means there's 73 centimetres of 100 dollars bills. Now, one bill of 100 dollars has a thick of 0,1075 millimetres. So, to equal the height of 73 centimetres (36,5 \u00d7 2) we need (73\u00f70,01075 cm) 6791 bills of 100 dollars approx. That means that Uzi has, at least (because we thought of it with only one stack in each foot, we could have used 4 stacks in each foot, for example) 679100 dollars in his possession. If he uses 4 stacks in each foot (+stability) that's 8 stacks, that means 8\u00d736,5cm=292cm of 100 dollars bills, that equals the amount of (292cm\u00f70,01075cm) 27163 bills of 100 dollars approx. That means the Uzi has 2,7 mill dollars approx. We could think he stands in 8 stacks in each foot, or 16 stacks, or 32 stacks, but I think the minimum to stand in with stability and not having the risk of the tower of Bill's to collapse is 4 stacks in each foot, meaning that **Uzi has, at least, 2.7 million dollars in his bank account if the money that he stands in are 100 dollars bills. If he stands in 1 dollar bills** (the lowest value possible), **his fat amount goes down to 27,16 thousand dollars approx.**\n\n\n\n\nIf this gets a reasonable amount of upvotes I'll calculate Uzi's money if standing in coins.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Hiphopcirclejerk","subreddit_id":"t5_2suwz","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Hiphopcirclejerk","subreddit_subscribers":72272,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"\u201cUh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh\u201d - Of Course","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Hiphopcirclejerk\/comments\/ckguy2\/uh_uh_uh_uh_uh_uh_uh_uh_uh_uh_uh_uh_uh_uh_uh_uh\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I want to build up some muscle, loose my belly fat, and gain some weight (goal is 120lbs) healthily.\n\nMy exercise schedule consists of this: \n\nMonday: Leg day- Exercises include squats, lunges, running, walking, mountain climbers, and back squats. When I am not doing walking or running, I am doing 25-50 reps of exercise for 1hr. \n\nTuesday and Thursday: Core Day- Exercises include sit-ups, crunches, planks, deadbugs, and the half kneeling wood chop. Both days last a minimum of 30 min, and maximum an hour. So it is 1-2 hrs of core exercise per week.\n\nFriday: Arm day- Exercises include lifting 5-10lb weights, planks, and push ups. I do these exercises for one hour.\n\nWedsnday and Saturday: Break days, no exercise.\n\nSaturday: Aerobics- Exercises include running, walking, cycling, jumping jacks, burpees and squats.\n\n(Note: I have only done Wedsnday.)\n\nDiet: I eat somewhat unhealthy, as mealtime normally consists of processed foods and frozen foods\/dairy. However, I am trying to make it a habit of eating 1 fruit a day, and I am starting to eat salads.\n\nAny and all advice is welcome.

Everyone in my immediate family (brother, dad, mum, aunty) have all done mushrooms as well with no negative effects. I have found each time to be incredibly enjoyable and illuminating. Not very long ago though my cousin was diagnosed with drug-induced\/sped-up schizophrenia and bi-polar from LSD. This has put some of my experiences with psychedelics into a new light as I am now worried that I may be more predisposed to mental illness than the average psychonaut. Basically I have had a few experiences that I could now interpret as psychosis while on mushrooms\/cactus that before I just thought of as 'going deep'. \n\nFor example once when I had had 2g of psilocybe subaeruginosa (my go to dose), I entered a state of bliss in which I had 'discovered' that I was a divine being. I also thought that my mates that I was with could speak telepathically with me and that they were congratulating me. I proceeded to walk away from my camp site and take off all my clothes and wander around butt naked thinking about how 'I am one with all, I am the same as Buddha\/Jesus' and was convinced that I was about to be 'absorbed into the whole'\/die (I was completely fine with this and laid on the floor amongst some trees). Coming back to reality from this state was very rough and I was pretty unresponsive to my friends when they found me laying there naked (I wouldn't speak and could only give them the thumbs up apparently). I can't remember much from the point where they found and it was as if I was in a dream. I hadn't met a few of the guys that I was camping with before so fair to say my ego was pretty deflated when I came back to reality but besides that I just interpreted my experience as possibly being due to different set and setting and since my subjective experience of it wasn't anything negative I only viewed it as a good thing. Also of note is that none of the other guys tripped as hard as me from the same dose and that I had never experienced something so far out except from a dose of 4g subaeruginosa.\n\nNow fast forward to after my cousin being diagnosed with his mental illnesses and I am looking at this event and a couple of similiar experiences (each being enjoyable but challenging\/confusing) as possible instances of psychosis as they could be interpreted as delusions of grandeur (my cousin was talking about being the messiah and needing to die to save the world and all that predictable schizophrenic stuff). I can't help but see the parallels between his psychosis and my experiences in the 'naked zone'. I guess I want other people's perspectives on if my experience seems to be anything atypical of mushroom insights and also if others would recommend me not to continue to take psychedelics.

This is my first pregnancy. I have been to my first OB appointment but we didn't do an ultrasound or anything... I have that scheduled for next week.\n\nAnyway Im an elementary teacher, and I have been doing almost nothing all summer - relaxing at home in the AC since i found out i was pregnant. Yesterday I had to spend all day running errands and all kinds of stress hit me because the new school year is starting soon and I am starting training and im buying a house and all kinds of crap is happening at once.\n\nSo last night I was having cramps. Like period cramps but not quite as bad as my normal period ones. I fell asleep SUPER early because I couldnt stay up. I chalked it up to a change in my normal activity and my preggo body was just struggling to keep up.\n\nAnyway I woke up at 4 am with some mild cramping and a wet feeling, like I had started my period (it almost always started while I was sleeping). I went to the bathroom and when I wiped there was a good amount of dark blood. The light was off and I panicked and didnt quite get a good look at it to see if there was clotting or anything. I went back to bed for maybe 20 or 30 minutes (and by that i mean i laid awake freaking out thinking i was having a miscarriage). Got up after 20 or 30 minutes. Wiped again, still a good amount of dark blood. Not as much as a normal period for me but enough to scare me. Went back to bed again and an hour later i went and wiped and there was a whole lot less, some red blood that i would equate to what my period looks like on its last day. Never had to put in any pads or anything, it stopped pretty quick and never got super heavy.\n\nAs the day went on I had that red spotting every other time i went pee.. not every single time. Now, about 3 hours later, its just brown like the very very end of my periods - looks like old blood. Not a lot but its there when i wipe. Sometimes its not even enough to see and i think its over and its back when i go pee again later.\n\nI called my nurse and she had me come in for a blood draw to check my hcg levels so i did that but havent heard anything back. She told me if there was a problem with the results she would order an ultrasound.\n\nSo im in that waiting game and i know i shouldnt stress but that is of course what im doing. I have googled to the ends of the google-verse.\n\nIm just wondering if anyone has had that kind of experience? If im lucky enough that theres an OB doc or nurse reading this - should i be freaking out?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"pregnancyproblems","subreddit_id":"t5_3hqhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/pregnancyproblems","subreddit_subscribers":219,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Bleeding at 11 weeks","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/pregnancyproblems\/comments\/ckh668\/bleeding_at_11_weeks\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

Quick backstory, I'm 44 and wife is 41. We have a 14 month old daughter. Both work full time jobs with different days off. Just bought a house that sucks up alot of money. Have 2 car payments, doctor bills every month, we are not rich so we have to watch what we spend.  \n\nSo, about 4 months ago, I decided in order to avoid resentment from wife and to give our daughter a sibling, which I do want, I agreed to try for another. Ive talked it over with a therapist also, and he pointed out and made me think of things that I havent thought of. I really thought it over and talked to my wife about things also and decided to go ahead and try. Within a month we found out she was pregnant. But 2 months later she had a miscarriage, due to the initial conception of the egg just not being fertilized correctly, no other reason we are told. She really took it hard, blaming herself, blaming god, very depressed. She sought counseling and after a couple weeks of constant crying  She seems pretty much back to normal now. She wants to try again and I'm leaning towards not. If this would happen again it would be just devastating. Not to mention all the other reasons, financial, exhausting, lack of sleep, that I dont want to go through again. Also, wife is overweight so that on top of age we are kind of a high risk. \n\nToday she brought up something about a toy almost being broke  and to not break it in case we have another, while waiting for my reaction. She does this sometimes to judge my reaction, and it bothers the piss out of me. I said dont know if I want another. She said she didnt understand and I was going back on my word since I said yes 4 months ago before the miscarriage and its not fair.  Btw, We still cant try yet due to miscarraige complications anyway, and I told her previously I'm not going to talk or decide for a bit (for like a month or two). \n\nIt's her dream to have 2 kids and basically I expect resentment for the rest of my life if I dont have another. At the same time I feel our relationship and individual health will struggle, and I may end up resenting her if I  give in and do try for another. Just for clarification I never agreed to 2 kids when we got married, was on the fence about having one. I can surely say I'm glad we have our daughter now though. \n\nAnyway I hope this isnt too incoherent and random, my thoughts are kinda all over the place. Guess I'm just lookimg for aome justification, because I feel like my wife seems to make it out as though I'm completwly wrong for not wanting to have another. Thanks for reading.\n\nEdit: maybe I should post this in marriage?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Parenting","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhn3","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Parenting","subreddit_subscribers":1343927,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Once again, to have a 2nd child or not","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/ckh9xv\/once_again_to_have_a_2nd_child_or_not\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I use pads so that sucked pretty bad. Went from 1 day of spotting and 5 of active bleeding to 4 days of bleeding and 2 of spotting, which may have been reduced even further had I used it from the start.\n\nDay 1: Spotting.\n\nDay 2: Can't evaluate but I soaked an overnight pad to the point of \"if I'd waited any longer I would have bled through\" in about 3 hours, so I'm wondering how long I'll last with a cup in. Vicious cramping.\n\nDay 3: A heavy day for me usually. Got to about 1\/3 full in 3 hours, and about 1\/2 to 3\/4(?) in 5 hours. Didn't really stop to look since I was getting the hang of removing it. Didn't really hurt to insert, kind of uncomfortable to take out but easy to ignore. Removal was messy when I waited for a while :( I changed it in the shower and felt the weirdest snapping feeling on the inside when it popped open, but that's the only time it happened. Sometimes my cramps come back on the second day but they didn't this time.\n\nDay 4: Normally medium to heavy but was actually pretty light with the cup in. Got in the habit of changing it whenever I used the bathroom (so every 4-ish hours) and never got over 1\/4 full. Generally only filled up to the top of the grippy rings on the bottom. Sharp cramping due to clotting but that's about it, and I rinsed it out in the shower immediately after. That was the closest it got to being heavy that day and even then it only got about 1\/3 full.\n\nDay 5: Light usually, and I could've gone literally all day without changing it but I did pretty frequently anyway just to get used to doing so.\n\nDay 6: Spotting.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n- Zero issues with opening, it actually opened a little too quickly a couple of times and I had to reinsert. Super important since I have very strong pelvic muscles.\n- The stem poked at me quite a bit, think I'll trim it a little (I use it to grab hold of it though so I won't completely cut it off). The cups sits right behind my pelvic bone so the stem actually hurt sometimes based on my movement.\n- Residual blood was easy to remedy, I wore backup pads for the first few days of active bleeding but stopped at Day 4 and had no issues. Even with the pads I barely got any residual blood on it before I learned how to correct that. *Zero leakage!*\n- Had no issues with bodily processes while it was in and no internal pressure.\n- Thanks to this thing I actually was able to forget I was bleeding for the last few days. The last time that happened, I was using sponge tampons.\n\nVerdict: Kinda love this thing. I'll have to test it for my whole cycle next time. I hope I last longer than I do with pads.\n\nFor reference, I'm 18, virgin with no kids, and an athlete with a medium\/high cervix.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"menstrualcups","subreddit_id":"t5_2st5x","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/menstrualcups","subreddit_subscribers":12167,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"First cycle with the small Yuuki soft complete!

I've played these games on and off every few years since I was something around 14 (And I'm 24 now, what a ride) and I always loved everything about them, they sparked my interest in RPGs in the first place. The customization, the multiple classes, the funny NPCs, the quests, the heavy dragon-themed fantasy world, and how your characters slowly grow stronger. I remember playing them with friends and it was always a blast, since I knew a little bit more English than they did I used to translate the story and all, it was a lot of fun. But since I'm from Brazil I never got to actually see much of the content since it required me to have an international credit card and 20 US$.\n\nEven though I recently had the opportunity to play newer games by living with a friend that owns a PS4, I always find myself coming back to them because of the nostalgia and the simplistic turn-based combat and progression system, there's something... Heartwarming about them, a special place in my heart perhaps.\n\nI know 20 US$ isn't much, but since I'm from Brazil that'd translate to almost 90 bucks, and that's... a lot (for me at least.)\n\nAre there any kind souls that own an account that they just don't use anymore or would be willing to provide such an account?

I've had a job at a grocery store, which was basically my first job from 2016-2018, and I've saved up quite a bit of money since then, and then I took a break to finish some school classes. I'm in community college, by the way.\n\nBack around..maybe, early May or so, I've had a talk with my mom after I got fired from my old job (from March to the end of April), 'cause they thought I was stealing, and apparently others were also accused of the same situation. Anyway, during that time when I had a talk with my mom, she's stated to me that 'retail' in the thing for me and that it's 'okay' to work in for the rest of your life. Now, retail is alright..it's alright as a starting job, and it's alright if you do decide to go with it for the rest until retirement but it's not something I wish to pursue for the rest of my life. I got pretty fed up because she's basically had the attitude of telling me what to do in a sense and deciding what's best for me. I'm basically the scapegoat in my family (2 other siblings) and my family barely listens to what I have to say, and my sister and mom are up there at being the worst due to how two-faced they are and that they never actually help me with anything, even though I do so much for them. I kind of got off-topic there, which I apologize..I'm just pretty fed up with everything in my life right now. Anything I ever say to them...it's like, idk...I feel like I should've put this in the r\/raisedbynarcississts subreddit but I wasn't sure since I have with another post once, and barely anyone responded.\n\nAnyway, thanks for whoever reads this, and the main situation of this is that my parents and siblings don't listen to me at all when I try and talk with them and try to put me down with my beliefs and what I want to do with my life.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2qjdm","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Advice","subreddit_subscribers":304789,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My mom thinks this is for me when I don't.","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/ckhhdl\/my_mom_thinks_this_is_for_me_when_i_dont\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

She is smart, kind, funny, charismatic and just a beautiful person to be around. I really do love her more than anything which is why this is breaking my heart\n\nLike many in the twenties, we have taken a fair share of soft drugs together to party but in my opinion never have taken it to abuse levels taking them once every 3-6 months for whatever social event. However after seeing the damage it has caused for her and a number of my friends around me, I am deciding to try quit them forever.\nThroughout her life she has always gone through periods of depression (has attempted to commit suicide before) which is so unfair because I really couldn't think of a person less deserving of it. We have been through these periods before and have supported her for has much as I can every step of the way. \n\nHowever at the beginning on the year, there came a period where she would go out clubbing, the home at 7am kind, every week and neglect to ever invite me. This was extremely weird for us because previous to that we had been partners in crime and were always excited to bring each other anywhere. Now I completely understand that in a relationship there are times when you want to go out with just your friends but this was happening every week for the period of 1-2 months. \n\nBeing someone who tries to see the best in everyone, I really did try to look past it as her trying to be an individual however the thoughts of her cheating on me, seeing someone else, using me as a second option really did start setting in \n\nSo we ended up arguing about it and ended in a lot of tears as I expressed exactly how I have been feeling and that I was starting to no longer trust her and there was no point in dating in the trust wasn't there. She understood completely where I was coming from and said she knew she was being a \"bad girlfriend\" and that she would change. She hadn't been cheating and I do trust her on this but that is pretty much all that was said about it and I wish I could go back in time and push further to get the reason why she was going out so she could've got the help she needs.\n\nWell everything went back to being perfect but these past couple of months  the exact same thing started again and this seriously the loneliest I have ever felt in this relationship. We fought about the exact same argument but instead this time I had the intent to break up with her due me telling her last time I wouldn't put up with this again. I told her to me exactly why she was doing it again and she told me that she takes drugs so she can \"just not feel like she wants to die\" although she says even on them she still feels suicidal. \n\nI seriously do love this girl but it pains me so much inside to watch someone kill themselves slowly inside. I understand that she has problems with her depression but I can't support her not giving herself a fighting chance through. I told her that she needs to go see a therapist (which she agreed upon) but that we would stay just friends because inside myself, I seriously can't support through all the drug use and I'm not sure if she is willing to quit. She initially said she doesn't know how to function without me but I think upon saying that she realised that she needs her independence back because she agreed she needs some time to herself to she a psych. I told her to tell me that I would support her if she ever needed help getting to the psych or falling on bad times and that if she got the help she needed that I am 100% willing to be her again\n\nNow this is were I seriously need help because at the end of the day I am 22 years old and have no fucking idea what I'm doing so I really would love to hear from people what their opinion on this is? Am I making the right decision in getting her help? Am I making the right decision in my own mental health? Is it possible to stay friends or do we go no contact? Has anyone else been through something similar and how did it end up? \nI am so lost and would love to hear advice from anyone on how to make this work\nIf I have left anything out that is missing or confusing, let me know and I will fix it\n\nTL;DR: Broke up with my depressed girlfriend for taking drugs to \"not feel like dying\" and prioritising them over our relationship. Told her I couldn't date her like this and cant support her if she doesn't give herself a fighting chance. Told to see a psych and get her mental health and independence and that then we can try again at a healthy relationship. Am I making the right decision?\n\nEdit: Spacing and Grammar","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationship_advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0cn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/relationship_advice","subreddit_subscribers":1945083,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I [22M] broke up with my depressed girlfriend [20F] for drug abuse and need advice","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/ckhl8b\/i_22m_broke_up_with_my_depressed_girlfriend_20f\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Quick backstory, I'm 44 and wife is 41. We have a 14 month old daughter. Both work full time jobs with different days off. Just bought a house that sucks up alot of money. Have 2 car payments, doctor bills every month, we are not rich so we have to watch what we spend.  \n\nSo, about 4 months ago, I decided in order to avoid resentment from wife and to give our daughter a sibling, which I do want, I agreed to try for another. Ive talked it over with a therapist also, and he pointed out and made me think of things that I havent thought of. I really thought it over and talked to my wife about things also and decided to go ahead and try. Within a month we found out she was pregnant. But 2 months later she had a miscarriage, due to the initial conception of the egg just not being fertilized correctly, no other reason we are told. She really took it hard, blaming herself, blaming god, very depressed. She sought counseling and after a couple weeks of constant crying  She seems pretty much back to normal now. She wants to try again and I'm leaning towards not. If this would happen again it would be just devastating. Not to mention all the other reasons, financial, exhausting, lack of sleep, that I dont want to go through again. Also, wife is overweight so that on top of age we are kind of a high risk. \n\nToday she brought up something about a toy almost being broke  and to not break it in case we have another, while waiting for my reaction. She does this sometimes to judge my reaction, and it bothers the piss out of me. I said dont know if I want another. She said she didnt understand and I was going back on my word since I said yes 4 months ago before the miscarriage and its not fair.  Btw, We still cant try yet due to miscarraige complications anyway, and I told her previously I'm not going to talk or decide for a bit (for like a month or two). \n\nIt's her dream to have 2 kids and basically I expect resentment for the rest of my life if I dont have another. At the same time I feel our relationship and individual health will struggle, and I may end up resenting her if I  give in and do try for another. Just for clarification I never agreed to 2 kids when we got married, was on the fence about having one.

She rolled her eyes and got down, her dad's rage was definitely growing, and she fainted enough to make him send a flurry her way\n\nShe dodged like lightning, some of his punches coming within a tenth of an inch but none connecting, she send an uppercut which staggers him, he clearly was not expecting such a tough blow to send him staggering. \n\nShe jumps up \"ahah, beating you daddy!\" she says in an ultra girly voice, before he recovers\n\n\"Shut up, your not a fucking fighter\" he sound slike he's about to cry and comes in swinging again, she parries several blows before moving in, getting past his fists and throwing a punch in his gut. he doesn;t double over, but the next three make him back up,. he clenches his arms around her in frustration\n\n\"What's wrong daddy, can't beat a girl in a boxing match? You always knew when I was a teenager I'd be able to kick your ass, right?\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" he said, tightening his hug around her, she leans back and grabs him by the belt, grunting as she lifts him u, before running into a wall and slamming him, hurting him badly enough for her to escape\n\n\"You cheated you little bitch\" he says as he gets up.\n\nShe rolls her eyes \"Sure daddy...sure. Tell ya what, since I'm a filthy cheater you can have a free shot\"\n\nThe audience goes crazy again and he runs up to her, throwing a fist into her jaw as hard as he could, she rolled with it a bit, before spitting a bit of blood on his shoe \"getting me off,\" she suggested, before she started going into him, completely covering every square inch of skin with her tiny fists, her bloody lips forelimb an evil smile as he becomes overwhelmed, soon finding himself on the floor. She stands over him, hands on hips\n\n\"So, who's the champion of this house, daddy?\"\n\n\"Shut up\" he says, getting up, she knocks him down as soon as he's on his feet again with a devastating punch to the chest. he;s grasping it on the ground and she asks again \"Y-you are\" he says, holding an arm in front of his face\n\nShe giggles and runs out. he tries to get to his feet, but she soon comes in with the belt of his (relatively) small time promotion over her shoulder, lifting him by the elbows \"look at this ladies, even if your dad's a real tough guy...no control over him\" she undoes his belt \"Now, for every hundred bucks I get...daddy loses an article of clothing\" she bites her bottom lip as his beaten face looks at the camera in horror\n\n***\n\n(recording of young lovers' quarrel)\n\nJimmy Pramus was at a salon with his first girlfriend, she was looking at both nails and hair, each of which was very expensive. Puberty had affected these two 13-year olds in very different ways, Mila was thick and blonde and developing curves, but barely 5'. Jimmy was 5'10 and thin, but instead of curves he had long and lithe muscles that his girlfriend loved staring at\n\nHe was apparently pretty tired ft he shorts Mila made him wear at this point, but the black haired boy was kind of proud of his musculature, he was a decent sprint runner and had been involved in competitive biking, sometimes winning against 16 or 17 year old boys. He rolled his eyes as she asked for some money, but the security camera showed her playfully spank him in response.\n\nHe pointed a finger and yelled, she rolled her eyes again, before her and a woman working at the salon had a laugh at the expense of men\n\nHe turned around and huffed, grabbing his bike helmet, but before he can put it on, Mina sneaks a wig under it, suddenly he has long blonde locks flowing out, she compliments him \"OOOH it looks so natural on you\"\n\nThe lady at the salon agrees \"although, maybe he needs nails to match\"\n\nJimmy grunts in anger before throwing it on the floor and yelling at his girlfriend \"Stop it, you are being so fucking weird right now!\" He shouts, Mina just smiles cutely\n\n\"Oh, shush, what's wrong, have a wet dream this morning or something?\" she asks before shaking her butt at the lady \"I give them to him, he's too shy to try anything with me though,\" she said, causing the woman to absolutely crack up, and Jimmy leaves the shop in an angry stride\n\nHe gets out and gets on his bike, the camera changes and we see Mina walking out \"geez Jimmy, sorry boys are so thin-skinned but I was just having fun, get back in here....maybe you'll like the new hair!\" she says, causing him to get on his bike and start peddling she darts out after him, following him down the street, he looks back, flabbergasted. the cameras change again as the girl pumps her legs, her breast and buttocks like ballasts as she strode forward, Jimmy looks back in confusion, having to change gears, he gets down a road but suddenly caught by Mina...\n\nhe struggles hard, but she finds herself dominating him easily, talking inaudibly in this camera footage, before grabbing him with one arm, pinning his arms to his side as she slings his bike over her shoulder with the other, walking slowly back toward the store, you can hear them as they get closer \"And you are getting the girliest hair and nails they offer, and we're selling your bike to pay for it, sweetheart\" he was already crying, the salon lady was laughing hard at the young lovers\n\n***\n\n(Showing you a wrestling video)\n\n\"hmm, fair, fair\" I say as I look up a video, finding it \"ahhh, looks like they finally had that exhibition match between that Russian wrestler and Russian gymnast. wanna...watch it and see what happens?\" I ask with a big smile\n\nthe girl is 70 kg, 5'9, wearing a bright and stylized gymnastics uniform, all smiles against her 120 kg 6'2 opponent. the bell sounds and they immediately start putting each other in holds, the wrestler seems to have an advantage, at first, before the gymnast starts using her flexibility, choking him with her legs while she was in a headlock...after than things get disastrous, the girl starts manhandling the larger more muscular blonde guy, looking absolutely giddy as she easily slips out of everything, before picking him up and slamming him, apparently quite happy with how she did it, she easily picks him up again and again, the guys is clearly terrified beyond his worst nightmare trying nothing more than escape against his feminine conqueror, but she is having none of it, forcing him to fight more and more, smashing and overpowering him, before finally standing on her hands and holding his midsection between her thighs, squeezing the life from him before collapsing him into a hold, the Russian man crying as the girl raises her hands, absolutely giddy with the crowd!\n\n***\n\n(Frat boy hazed by sorority sisters)\n\nTodd Phillips was a pretty solid guy, standing 6'4, weighing about 230 lbs of mostly muscle, and looking straight forward as he held his hands behind his back, mumbling something to himself as his handsome face was matched against some make-up swabs&gt;\n\nGina Davis, a 5'9 Cheerleader with black hair, blue eyes, swarthy skin, and a round ass that prohibited most jeans simply by its sheer size giggleed \"You know, since you are blond and blue eyed, I think this lipstick will look really nice on you\"\n\n\"Damn straight\" Said Cindy, a 5'1 blonde with a perfect hourglass figure, her natural 36\" C cups looking a bit over-sized in her current purple tube top, her extremely tapered waist covered in abs and her flaring hips half exposed by loose jeans as she swings around her short spiky locks and brings Todd a DDD bra, before reaching up to feel the shirtless blond boy's pectoral muscle \"Oh yes, I think this will fit nicely\"\n\nTodd sighs \"do we really have to do this\" he sounds quite angry at this point\n\nGina waves her hair around, it moves like its in a fucking shampoo commercial, landing to cover one eye while her other perfect blue, framed in black eyeshadow, stares deeply into him, she thrusts out her bust \"yes, we doll up all the sisters. You should be happy, your the best girl this year...you know boys drool over giant titties!\" she playfully squeezes both of his pecs with her small, surprisingly powerful hands, Cindy laughs hard and points when he cringes\n\nTodd looked at Gina angrily, but felt some fear from the intensity of her blue eyes, clenching his fists \"Gina, these aren't boobs. they are pecs. unlike your soft lumps of flesh\" he swings his finger around, nearly touching her breasts, she smiles widely at the gesture, Cindy mischievously grabs her own breasts and leans toward Gina, who can barely avoid laughing \"These are pecs. they don't go in a bra, they go in a shirt\"\n\n\"Just lumps of chest fat, babe\" Cindy condescending remarks, before he angrily looks down, finding her green eyes just as intense in a staredown \"No, they are muscle, they help me lift. I didn't eat for these, I trained for them, they actually help me do stuff!\" he says angrily. the girls burst out laughing and he paces to the back of the room, struggling to remove the skirt they put on him. the girls whisper at each other before Gina approaches \"Fine, that works, I guess we do something beside doll you up, let me help\" she walks toward him and reaches under the hem of his skirt, grabbing the frilly pink-and-white=-striped panties he had on and giving him an atomic wedgie, quickly hooking them over his head, both girls laugh.\n\nHe struggles to get them off, but Cindy tackles his legs, he's impressed by the speed of the lithe girl. He wasn't a wrestler, but she was certainly able to use her speed to grapple with him, at least when the underwear on his head, flossing his ass, and smashing his testes were distracting him\n\n\"You are so fucking wrong, gymbunny\" said Cindy, before jumping up and slamming both knees into his pecs, bruising the muscles and making him howl out in pain, Gina laughed hard, her rbeasts jigled as she slapped her knee \n\nin confusion and humiliation at the girl \"These are useful\" she started flexing her own pecs, making her breasts bounce around before placing them on his face.\n\nHe could smell her musk but pull in no air, finding two strong hands on his wrists as he impotently tried to struggle, soon he was unconscious. when he woke up, he was found dangling over a toilet, his ankles and wrists hogtied, Gina seemed to carry him like he was a piece of paper \"OHey baby boy, those wimpy muscles sure are light\" the 5'9 Italian Brunette began, before turning his face to a toilet \"we both pissed in there while you were asleep. but we forgot to flush!\"\n\nToodd screamed in pain, his muscles straining against his bonds as his face gets dunked in. he screams as the piss from both girls invades every orifice on his head, he tastes\n\nthem and smell them and even breathes them for nearly a minute before the toilet is flushed. he breathes hard after that.\nGina smiles and hands him off to Cindy. he expect to get painfully dropped on the floor, but finds she has no trouble either \"as I said, our girly fat is superior to your useless male muscle\" he was too distracted by the taste, smell, and feeling of piss to talk much, not to mention his lack of breath \"Now, lets try something else. \" she walked into the room and turned on the TV :\"I have been working out my awesome girl muscles\" holding him with one hand, diminutive Cindy flexed a bicep Todd actually found scary \"So, I've been taking protein. major stomach bomb, that\" she says, placing him down on his back, then dropping her jeans and panties \"and farting is so unfeminine...unless I have someone to breathe them I'll be your air source until Ellen ends\" she snidely smiles, before planting her round, firm ass on his face, clenching her gluted with enough force to keep him in place and farting directly into his nose, Gina once again laughs quite hard\n\nThis goes on for quite some time, the girls kissing one another as they ytorture him, each laughing with every fart he has to breathe directly into his lungs. he hates the smell, the taste, but can sense nothing but it...his body betraying him, he finds he is soon simply laying there and taking it. the strong cheeks around his face do not allow him to slip out, they are like an awesomely strong vice around his head as she is assaulted\n\nAfter they grew bored with that, the girls picked him up and threw him in the shower. he realized he was naked when that happened \"Gotta clean you up\" Gina said. \n\n\"f-fuck off\" the already traumatized Todd said meekly, Gina dropped her dress and revealed her awesomely curvacious body in nothing but a purple thong. she had some soft flesh around her belly, and everything was white and hairless. her thighs were huge, but surprisingly firm, as her chest was pointing right at it \"Scared of boobs now, boy?\"\n\nIn the shower, the naked jock's world was rocked. he loved to look at her tits, their firmness and big niplles, long suckable beads...but he got flashbacks to his smothering, before he could contemplate this, she smothered him against the wall and knocked him out again\n\nTodd awoke again, this time in the bra and panties they talked about, a mirror in front of his face showed his make up he tried to scream but found his mouth gagged up, he chewed on his gag and discovered the distinctive smell of female foot sweat, he had dirty gym socks in his mouth! he tried to escape but the surprisingly strong girls held him down, then he heard the buzz...each was wearing a vibrating strap-on, both bigger than his own erection. they held his knees to his shoulders, the tiny Cindy inserted herself first and started thrusting, before Gina picked them up to get her own toy in. he was getting double penetrated and felt like he'd be split in half in no time!

She moved around awkwardly at first, he got a kill on her...then she figured out the controls some \"When does it stop?\" she asked, casually getting away from him and shooting a few times. she quickly got into it 'Is the game really this easy?\" she asked, he was getting frustrated, and she laughed \"baby boy you looks so upset!\"\n\nHe got aggressive and started using some bugs, she avoided for the most part, before countering hard, killing him a third time in a row \"hey do I win now?' he said, handling her controller awkwardly\n\nHe jests at there and steamed, she looked at him before placing a hand on her chest and laughing hard \"Oh my god, your so...\" she started then considered \"Hmm, well, maybe discuss another career. you finish the laundry and maybe I'll take over the stream\" she said while rubbing his hair\n\nArryn Jones rolled her eyes as her son crossed his arms, looking down at the mother seated next to him as she looked up at him, she was about a head shorter than her dark haired son, but often made up the difference with a set of killer heels \"Baby Boy\" the mother began \"I think I ordered you to finish the laundry\" she becomes irritated, you can hear hints of it in her voice\n\n\"Come on mom, I was just doing my job! I need the cash-\"\n\nShe sternly cut him off, the chat blew up with excitement as she demanded \"RObert Aaron Jones, do that laundry right now or sole help me I will Spank you in front of your internet friends!\" and with that he got up and walked away. \n\n\"wasn't fair anyway..\" he started, she laughed at him 'maybe not, but I won and we made a deal!\" she said, continuing to play the game in his absence\n\n\"Oh, neat features\" she observed, settling in a bit, a whole bunch of supercats flashed and she looked down at them \"Am I supposed to read all these?\" she said, before seeing a few asking if she'd played before\n\"No I haven't always been able to beat Bobby at most stuff, I am 30 years older than him,\" she said, blasting a bunch more players \"wow this is easy, do all guys play so poorly?\" she leaned in, showing her cleavage to the camera, she noticed some comments and giggled a bit \"I still got it huh? well, I don't suppose there's anything wrong with cooking, especially since you guys are all getting your butts kicked...\"\n\na few minutes later Bobby comes up, mumbling something and carrying a hamper of clothes, Arryn waves at him \n\n\"Did you wash all my bras? and my work-out socks?\" she says, giggling as he blushes fervently \n\n\"Yes!\" RBoert announces, before she got on her feet and walked up to him, scruffing his hair \"Oh, by the way, I got super chatted a lot of money for you,\" she said, poking his shoulder\n\nHe looked back, she'd received nearly $2000! He gasped, before looking angrily at her.\n\n\"Hmm, I'll let you keep them\" she said before grabbing his shoulders \"But some of your fans may move to  my new channel\" she suggests\n\nHe grunts, but is pulled into a hug, her arms keeping him against her big bust, his comparatively lithe form struggling a bit in her thick arms \"Love you bobby\" she says before giving a bit loud smooch on his left cheek\nHe groaned, it became apparent he was legitimately struggling \"Maybe you need to play less and go to the gym more, baby boy\" she says, loudly kissing him again, \n\n\"Moooom....please\" he whines\n\n\"What? I'm just hugging my sweet son. he gets out when he says he loves me\"\n\n\"Love you mom, please let me stream again\"\n\n\"Sure, baby boy, go pretend you can play video games\" she kisses his chin before setting him down, playfully slapping him on the rump  before she walks away \" but girls are better at this\" she concluded, shaking her hips as she walked out...","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"futarp","subreddit_id":"t5_323v0","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/futarp","subreddit_subscribers":5829,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[F4A][Futa4A][A4A] trading vignettes (probably on female dominance, maybe on something else)","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/futarp\/comments\/ckhmx2\/f4afuta4aa4a_trading_vignettes_probably_on_female\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

So I love going to strip clubs. Yes it's nice to get lapdances and have a beautiful young woman grinding against you, but the thing I really love about strip clubs is just talking with the workers.\n\nI love talking with beautiful young women, as they wear zero to no clothes, just like we were in a coffee shop or somewhere else in public. The combination of simple conversation while her breasts hang free is so interesting to me, almost taboo in a way. I love getting to know them (or the character they are playing) because that then makes any further interaction with them so much more meaningful than if it was just a random girl's thong I was putting a dollar into. One of my favorite lapdances ever was from a woman who had told me she was a yoga instructor, and just that little tidbit of knowledge made the dance that much more intimate and personable.\n\nSo what I am looking for is for someone to play a worker at the strip club that approaches me, and you can take it from there! The stripper can look like whatever you want. The scene can go wherever you want...end at my buying you a drink, or a lapdance, or maybe you want to take me to the special \"vip\" room for some more entertainment.

(for ecology, evolution, and natural resources, and minoring in animal science) Will be going for about 3 years, and am at a loss of how I am going to pay. I am 24, have my associates from CC in NJ (only was I was able to go was because my dad is an electrician for the school so tuition was free). I moved to CA for 3 years and tried to go to school out there but not a lot of my credits were transferring, so it was going to take me 3 extra years just to have the classes I needed (retaking a bunch that I took in NJ) just to be considered to get into a uni there. So, made the decision to come back and go to RU. \n\nMom passed away in 2014. Doing all researched basically by myself and I am going crazy. My dad does not understand a lot of this, and barely anything about college since he didn\u2019t go. I am extremely grateful he is trying to help me, but it is also exhausting trying to get him to know its just how college is and he can\u2019t just ask the college not to charge so much. He really lives in his own world and is not up to date with a lot of views and technology. Not in an \u2018old tough dad\u2019 kind of way\u2026 more like he\u2019s just a super happy guy that doesn\u2019t realize how cold reality can be, very naive and little kid like. \n\nThe dilemma; I am broke:\nI moved from cali to nj recently and barely have any savings, about 300-400 to my name. I got a new job and make 18 an hour. Trying to save but only have a month left until school. I am able to transfer in the same company to a location 15 min from RU. Not exactly sure how much I will be working (at the same rate): probably 4 hours 3 days a week.\n\n-My bills are about $800 a month\n-my credit score is 663 \n-I am $23,175 in debt between my car loan and credit cards (1 wells fargo that I don\u2019t use that is probably saving me, 1 navy fed, 1 victorias secret)\n-Dad does not make a lot of money and lives paycheck to paycheck. \n-Dad makes about $50,000 a year, bills are about $3000 in bills a month.\n-Dads credit score is 700\n      -he has gone bankrupt in the past but it was 7-10 years ago so it should not show \t\t       up (according to what I read while researching)\n\nCosts\/$ values:\nGrand cost for everything per year: about $36,224 (estimated)\n\n-Grants: $8445\n    -I also applied to a couple scholarships but have not heard back, they are not for much, maybe 6k total\n\n-Federal loans: I will be taking all that were offered: $6,000 unsubsidized, $4500 subsidized\n-Somehow term bill came out to be $5,139 for 1st semester \n\t-I called and was on phone for an hour making sure this is right and there won\u2019t \t\t\tbe anymore fees added on later. next semester should be about the same \t\t\t\tamount.\n\nOptions:\nI have tried to prequalify for some private loans by myself but they say I'm not eligible without a cosigner. (I am going to apply for 1 loan just to see what I will be offered) Dad does not want to be cosigner or take out loans since he has had bad credit experiences in the past\u2026 however he recently said he will if its the last option. I have no one else that would be able to cosign but my dad. I know any interest rate will most likely be high. But according to my research if you have good credit it is worth looking at private loans as interest rates could be lower, but if you have \u2018eh\u2019 or bad credit and credit history the PLUS loan would probably be a better interest rate.\n\nGot dad to apply for parent plus loan and we did not receive and interest rate yet, but my dad is overwhelmed by how expensive it will be and is scared of it all. He keeps coming up with new plans like : refinance the house to have money to pay half in cash and half with credit card (dont think this is a good idea) \u2014 dad called around and it won\u2019t work out anyway. I will be the one to pay my student loans off but he is still scared because he will be on the loan. (Don't get me wrong I am scared too and hope I will have the money, since my field is not the most profitable)\n\nI need to pay my term bill by 8\/14\/19 or else we get a $140 late fee (which is not a big deal in the grand theme of things) but I am getting nervous because if somehow we come up with the money, we will need another 5k in 4 months for next semester. Dont like the idea of more loans but at least I will not have to worry about getting the money for college each semester while going to school. I really want to make my RU experience as good as it can be and be in certain clubs (such as the equestrian team which will be more fees).\n\nSorry I know this is long but I wanted to give you guys a backstory so you can see the whole picture. I am really feeling defeated and need guidance. Any suggestions to help me pursue the best route? I am not sure what my next step should be. Any input is greatly appreciated, THANKS GUYS! \n\nPS sorry if there are any typos or if the setup of the post is confusing, I have no energy left to make it as good as a college essay, and just want to get this post up.\n\nEDIT:Someone requested I provide a breakdown of tuition so here and three screenshots of the breakdown.

It was just practice for an upcoming game next week but the coach decided to make it a free-for-all game, something about making us better at being independent players or something stupid like that. If there was one thing most of shared , specifically you and me, was an huge lust for sex and the desire to rip our clothes off right now given the intensity of the game.*\n\n*The heat from the weather today was almost palpable and I wasn't sure whether that was a good thing or not. For one it was a nice day and we got to enjoy the heat while we played a \"friendly\" game of soccer, but we were all sweating like crazy and desperate wanted to finish it so we could heat inside and have a cool shower, which was cool with me since I always enjoyed seeing my teammates naked and none of us had any problem showing off the goods. Even now in an intense game, we still made time to fool around, some casual flirting and groping that was all consensual. I mean if we can enjoy seeing each other naked then we can definitely enjoy a little hands on stuff when the coach wasn't watching. Some of us even had our shirts off which didn't help my already thobbing member that, while flaccid, could get hard anytime and anywhere. Guess it's a gift and a curse, but chances it'll get very hard in the showers.*\n\nHey there! So this is my new roleplay prompt that I'm simply calling 'Soccer Boys', although I really hope it doesn't end at just soccer \ud83d\ude09 Just to give you a little bit of info on myself, my names Josh, I'm 20 years old and am bisexual, but I'm only looking to do this with either a guy. I'd prefer if my partners were around my age so between 18-23 just because that's a preferred age for me with guys. I'm a top when it comes to the guys and never bottom so keep that in mind. I also don't mind trans guys or gender fluid people so don't be shy! \n\nTo be honest, the soccer practice is only the start of a multi scenario rp I want to try, with a lot of fun scenarios that I think would be fun! These are a few of the ideas I had so hopefully you like some of them. \n\nLocker Rooms: This would probably happen after the soccer game and would be the easiest way to branch out the rp. Basically after the soccer game, you and decide to have a shower to cool off from the heat and start to fool around almost immediately. Soon after we start discussing what to do next since we wanna keep the fun going. Which leads nicely into:\n\n-The Beach: Given how nice the day has been, it'd be such a shame to waste it indoors so why not head to the beach nearby for nude hanging out. We could head to a secluded spot and have some fun in the water or just enjoy the sand while we fool around some more. Of course we could always practice soccer some more and make a kinky game out of it.\n\n-Unofficial Swim Practice: Why bother with going to the shower first when theres a perfectly empty swimming pool in the school gym hall that's just waiting to have two naked sweaty guys jump in and have some fun. \n\n-Pizza at my\/your house: Maybe as a way to relax after a long game of soccer, we head back to one of our houses, conveniently neither of our parents are home and decide to get some pizza. In the meantime we have some fun before the rather cute and young pizza guy gets here and give him a nice \"tip\" for all the trouble he went through on such a hot day.\n\n-Sex Fighting Arena: So apparently you had a solution to the heat that could be found back at your place, specifically your basement where you were planning something that would \"cool us off\". What I didn't realize was that you made a basement sized fighting pit that was covered in oils, outfits and a scoring system with its own rules that were purely to show how kinky it all was. I should've suspected something when you mentioned how much you enjoyed wrestling because you liked to be close to half naked guys. \n\nI'm open to ideas for other activities because I love to get creative with this kind of stuff! By all means bring your ideas and chances are I'll like them if it doesn't go into my limits and if not then I'll be honest with you. \n\nKinks wise I'm generally limitless aside from a few obvious ones like scat, rape, piss, gore, vore, vomit and torture.\n\nMy kinks include: I have a pretty big foot fetish (your feet by the way), twinks, goths\/emos, femboys, slim or athletic bodies, power bottoming, bubble butt, smooth body, \nfurries, anthros, sluts, threesomes, group sex, rough sex, cum stuffing, light bondage, outdoors, oral, ass play, flexibility, nudism, sex games, excessive cum, teasing, details, flirting\/dirty talk, kissing, licking, biting, scratching, hair pulling, race play, wet sex, showers, confidence, romance, oil play, clothing and long srps. My main kinks would be the foot fetish, twinks, sluts, flirting, kissing, teasing and flexibility. Also if you can play as multiple characters then that's perfect but if you can't it's cool, just for some extra holes \ud83d\ude09. \n\nI really hope you're interested.

Nothing ever helps. At best the meds do nothing, at worst I have horrible reactions that put me in the hospital. \n\nSeptember of 2017 I was put on Effexor. Helped a lot the first month, then it just leveled out to me feeling exhausted 24\/7, no motivation, no drive, nothing. But it got rid of all my suicidal thoughts so I kept with it. Upped doses until I got to 225mg. Still felt like garbage.\n\nMed doctor suggested this \"last resort\" combo they use for treatment resistant depression called \"California rocket fuel\". Ok I'm on board. \n\nStarted taking Remeron 7.5mg with my 225mg Effexor about a month and a half ago. Holy butts it was like a full 180 and I wanted to cry out of happiness that I felt like myself again. Me, someone with crippling anxiety, agoraphobia, so depressed and exhausted I never did anything, was DOING THINGS. I was cleaning the house, talking to people, smiling, I even went out on the lake with my friend's family without being coaxed! I had my life back. Though I was also eating everything that ever existed and gained 20 lbs in about 2 weeks...\n\nBut I did too much and burnt myself out. Effexor has caused physical problems for me that have left me disabled; frequent vertigo, spiking heart rate whenever I stand, constant fatigue from minor tasks, simple things take energy out of me like I just ran a mile, and a lot more. This didn't go away when I started Remeron, I just didn't care, I wanted to do stuff so I did. And it caught up with me. Body aches, more fatigue than I usually have, just really felt like I was hit by a truck. \n\nThen I got sick. Fever, sore throat, more body aches, your typical viral bug. But when I recovered from being sick...I felt like I did before the Remeron. Thinking I was just still getting better from being sick I really buckled down to take care of my body. Soup, rest, relax. I slept so much about 5 days ago that I missed a dose of my Effexor. And well, if you know anything about Effexor you know that's super not good. Missing one dose is enough to get bad withdrawal symptoms. I have alarms that go off for each of my meds so I don't miss doses but I was just so groggy and in a fog that when my alarm went off I got up and don't remember if I had taken my meds, and if I did I didn't know if I took the right ones since I slept long enough for both alarms to go off and was foggy enough to not understand what time it was. So I didn't know if I took it or not and didn't want to dose twice, so I just waited it out. Within 8 hours I had horrible brain zaps, shaky, eyeballs hurt, skin hurt, felt like I was being electrocuted every 6 seconds...yep I missed it. \n\nSo I gave a couple days for my meds to be back to normal and to feel normal again. But here we are...and I still just feel like I did before the Remeron. Why? Why did it suddenly level out like the Effexor? \n\nI don't want to go up in my dose cuz I've already gained more weight than I'd like and I have eating issues I'm not ready to address and no self control when I'm hungry. I liked the appetite suppression Effexor gave me, I ate only once a day and was finally able to lose the 40lbs I gained when I was on Seroquel in 2016. I'm already upset I've gained 20lbs so fast and I'm scared of gaining more. I literally have no self control and I know I'm not ready to address it and fix it yet. Without the effects of meds I already was a binge eater. I either ate nothing, or I ate EVERYTHING, to the point my stomach felt hard and I couldn't breathe and wanted to cry. I just couldn't stop. And when I didn't eat it wasn't like I was restricting myself, I just wasn't hungry and sometimes wouldn't be for a couple days. I don't know why. But if I'm hungry, I can't get myself to not eat. I know I was likely underweight from the Effexor, I was 93lbs. I'm 26 and 4'11. But now I'm 115 and worried I'll keep gaining, especially if I have to up my dose. \n\nWhat are my options? Has anyone else experienced the sudden flat line with Remeron and Effexor? Am I gonna have to up my dose and address my eating problems?

I've gone through a lot of therapy and I'm 4 years clean of self harm but this is kind of putting me off.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"cna","subreddit_id":"t5_2shfy","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/cna","subreddit_subscribers":4103,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Feeling strange.","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cna\/comments\/ckhxpy\/feeling_strange\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

This is my first pregnancy. I have been to my first OB appointment but we didn't do an ultrasound or anything... I have that scheduled for next week.\n\nAnyway Im an elementary teacher, and I have been doing almost nothing all summer - relaxing at home in the AC since i found out i was pregnant. Yesterday I had to spend all day running errands and all kinds of stress hit me because the new school year is starting soon and I am starting training and im buying a house and all kinds of crap is happening at once.\n\nSo last night I was having cramps. Like period cramps but not quite as bad as my normal period ones. I fell asleep SUPER early because I couldnt stay up. I chalked it up to a change in my normal activity and my preggo body was just struggling to keep up.\n\nAnyway I woke up at 4 am with some mild cramping and a wet feeling, like I had started my period (it almost always started while I was sleeping). I went to the bathroom and when I wiped there was a good amount of dark blood. The light was off and I panicked and didnt quite get a good look at it to see if there was clotting or anything. I went back to bed for maybe 20 or 30 minutes (and by that i mean i laid awake freaking out thinking i was having a miscarriage). Got up after 20 or 30 minutes. Wiped again, still a good amount of dark blood. Not as much as a normal period for me but enough to scare me. Went back to bed again and an hour later i went and wiped and there was a whole lot less, some red blood that i would equate to what my period looks like on its last day. Never had to put in any pads or anything, it stopped pretty quick and never got super heavy.\n\nAs the day went on I had that red spotting every other time i went pee.. not every single time. Now, about 3 hours later, its just brown like the very very end of my periods - looks like old blood. Not a lot but its there when i wipe. Sometimes its not even enough to see and i think its over and its back when i go pee again later.\n\nI called my nurse and she had me come in for a blood draw to check my hcg levels so i did that but havent heard anything back. She told me if there was a problem with the results she would order an ultrasound.\n\nSo im in that waiting game and i know i shouldnt stress but that is of course what im doing. I have googled to the ends of the google-verse.\n\nIm just wondering if anyone has had that kind of experience? If im lucky enough that theres an OB doc or nurse reading this - should i be freaking out?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"pregnant","subreddit_id":"t5_2qwzb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/pregnant","subreddit_subscribers":38772,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Bleeding?","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/pregnant\/comments\/ckhy8z\/bleeding\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}
