I took the personality test at Understandmyself.com.\n\nI had a result that troubled me somewhat: On Extroversion I scored at the 0th percentile. My full results were:\n\nAgreeableness\n68th percentile\nConscientiousness\n59th percentile\nExtraversion\n0th percentile\nNeuroticism\n69th percentile\nOpenness to Experience\n98th percentile\n\nThe Extroversion results are split into: Enthusiasm: 0th percentile and Assertiveness 3rd percentile.\n\n I won't give a full life story because there is too much to talk about. I'll just say where things are now. I am 30, male. I don't really have any friends except some old ones who don't live near me anymore (Over the last 12 years I haven't lived in one place for more than 6 months). I spend every night smoking marijuana and delving into music (I am obsessed with guitar playing) and playing online chess. I am not exaggerating, almost every night I do this. I have started to try to turn things around in various ways, but I was wondering if there is any advice for someone with results like this. My intuition is that this is an uncommon personality composition. I think I should try to see a therapist, but I would like to find a good one and I'm not sure how to do that or if I'm covered by medical insurance? My results with therapy so far have been unsatisfactory, but I haven't been in at least 5 years.\n\nThanks, I doubt this will be read by Dr. Peterson himself, but if he does read this, his lectures on YouTube have really illuminated what has gone wrong in my life. Specifically, what things are my fault and what things are the result of my innate characteristics. I am starting to learn how to \"fake\" extroversion but it's an uphill climb and there are more valleys than peaks so far. This long weekend I am feeling very down, and although I have caught myself before entering a depressive episode I still don't feel great about not seeing anybody.

Cold shower\n2. Reduced phone use during dinner\n3. Slept earlier (1am but still better than 4am)\n\nI read on this sub a few days ago that small changes in the present can have significant impacts on the future, much like how time travelers in TV shows are cautious when going back in time because small alterations to the past can have unimaginable consequences to the present\/future. I believe nofap and all the good habits I'm starting to pick up will all snowball into positive benefits (some call them \"superpowers\") in the future.

A month ago, on day 8 of my second good streak, I held eye contact with a beautiful stranger walking down the street and we smiled at each other. Believe it or not, it was the first time something like that happened to me, and I know now that nofap doesn't give you \"superpowers\", it just reveals who you truly are.

He constantly reassures me he wants a future, moving in together, marriage, babies, the whole shabang. But there's a problem. Him and I have continually had about 3 major fights regarding him moving out of his parents' house. He's 22 and I'm 20. I've lived on my own with my sister in our own place since I was 18. The first couple months of him and I dating my sister and I weren't getting along and he said he'd be willing to move out with me since he thinks my sister is verbally abusing me. Well, I start doing all the research, scheduling viewings, and right as we're about to leave he says he doesn't want to go. This spirals into a huge fight about how he has debt he wants to pay off so that if we do move in together we'll be able to afford rent. I tell him we will never be 100&amp;#37; financially stable since we're both in our early 20's and I'm currently in college and he's planning on going. Fast forward a few months and me moving back into my parents house, he keeps telling me he wants to move out with me because he hates living at home but that he wants to wait a year. I agree to stay at my parents until then. \n\nEventually to help me sister out with rent I move back in with her only to find out our landlord is selling our apartment and didn't bother to even let us know. My sister tells me she wouldn't mind if all 3 of us live together but my boyfriend says he wants a week or two to think about it. Again, huge fight. We'd be financially stable and I'd live with my 2 favorite people. Eventually all this fighting leads to him saying no he isn't going to live with both of us and that he wants to look at apartments again within the next few months. Keep in mind now, this is the THIRD time this has happened by now. The fighting is driving my anxiety insane, I have OCD as well so the apartment is the only thing I want to talk about. My sister found a 1 bedroom apartment she will see if she got approved for on Monday but she said she'll cancel if just I agree to move in with her into another apartment. However, a few months back around the second fight I told my boyfriend it was his last shot and that if he didn't move out with me by the end of this years things would be over for us because I deserve to have someone who wants the same future as me. He said he wouldn't let me down but now it's hard to trust him after the past few incidents.\n\nI honestly have no idea what to do because now it's crunch time and if I don't make this life changing decision by Monday the decision will be made for me. Advice would be greatly appreciated. With all the back and forth it makes it hard for me to even consider the idea of us getting married or having kids because he hasn't been reliable up until now.\n\nTLDR; Not sure if my boyfriend is serious about me","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"offmychest","subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/offmychest","subreddit_subscribers":676540,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I don't know if you'll ever want to move in together but it's now or never.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/offmychest\/comments\/8v6ho0\/i_dont_know_if_youll_ever_want_to_move_in\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

I'm 25 now. \n\nI've gone years in the past without doing anything or thinking about it but inevitably I'd return to self harming. I haven't cut with a razor in almost 3 years but what continues to stick with me is scratching and picking. The past year has been rough but tonight I'm particularly struggling.  I've always struggled with feeling like I'm not \"good enough\" and that I will never be. \n\nA few months ago I developed feelings for a new friend who is moving away for school in a few weeks. We've become close and I confessed that I have feelings for him a little while ago. He admitted that if he wasn't going away for school soon he would seriously consider it. We talked for a while and I felt better and he reassured me it's not a rejection just bad timing. But the more I think about it the more I'm convincing myself that he's using him moving away as a scapegoat excuse to \"let me down gently\" and that he actually is not interested in me and the feeling that I'm not good enough and am undeserving of love from anyone are coming back. \n\nThis is making the itch to harm again come back strong because for me it's comforting and in a weird way I feel like I deserve it. I haven't really talked about my self harm with my friends and the one that I like definitely doesn't know though I have seen him look at the faded white patches on my arm. \n\nI know if I give in and scratch a patch raw I will feel better. But at the same time I won't be able to leave that scab alone long enough to heal and if I relapse after 13 months of not doing anything I know it will make me want to do more and it'll create a cycle.\n\nThere is a lot of other things going on in my life right now that are contributing to this - it is not just my friend. However I think that this is kind of like the last straw. I know a relationship will not magically fix my problems but with this friend I felt like that things were starting to look up for me. I enjoy talking to him, I feel safe and comfortable with him especially when I hug him and I can hear his heartbeat and warmth. I'm bisexual and I've had crushes on 2 of my best friends and got over my crush not liking me in return. I figured this one would not be so bad but its making me more frustrated than anything since he didn't give me a solid yes or no but in my mind it may as well be a no. It might of been different had he not be going away for school or if he knew that he was definitely moving back after graduating. But I feel like this could potentially be the start of another cycle all over again and I needed to get this off my chest. \n\nAt 25 I feel like I should not be dealing with my self harm like I am and that something like this shouldn't be the reason for me wanting to self harm again.

I have been hospitalised many times but this Jan I was placed under mental health act after almost slipping into a coma from malnutrition , and was under a 'red flag' anyway for suicide attempts. I have been receiving intensive inpatient treatment - and am now doing so much better, I am even getting discharged soon.\n\n I through past and present use drugs recreationally and love them, as they actually keep me in a good head space when my brain actually has enough nutrition to work. \n\nAnyway in jan I was sedated against my will, via IV promethazine (unsure of dosage as was in temporary state of psychosis half the time and don't remember much). But OH MY DAYS. I have never done drugs via IV before , and even though many don't see promethazine as recreational I was loving it. It was so intense. My eyes were rolling, it spread all over my body, it was nothing like dropping a pill or snorting a line. It was insane.\n\nBut now I can't stop thinking about shooting up. I honestly can't. And touching drugs ever since, whilst still enjoyable has not held a candle to it. Obviously I know the risks and I don't think I would become addicted, and even though mentally unstable people should not mix with drugs, they get me out the house and doing things and honestly have kept me alive I believe. And can you really tell me that I should just go back to feeling complete emotional numbness that I don't believe will go away even though I have tried so many alternatives? Physical illnesses can be chronic and I think its time the media actually lets people know that sometimes (not always!!) mental illnesses are too, instead of portraying every situation as having a nice fluffy ending with a little therapy and pharmaceutical support.\n\nHonestly all I want is to feel that rush again, but on my own terms and not pinned down by strangers. \n\nSo as much as I hate the UK mental health sectioning acts for making me feel like an animal with no rights and making my mental health worse, they have given me one of my most pleasurable drug experiences to date.\n\nI know this wasn't really a question but I just needed to vent and maybe people have felt the same way- it would be nice not to feel alone in this.

First of all I'm 16 and so I'm kinda new to periods so I apologize for my lack of knowledge. I have a few questions, sorry if they sound dumb. Throwaway account for hopefully obvious reasons.\n\n\nBackground: I've had my period for three years now. During the past three years I've been wearing pads because they seemed to be the most comfortable option (I'm kinda scared of putting objects inside my vagina). Lately however, my period has gotten heavier, to the point I have to change my pad once every 2-3 hours, which is a problem while sleeping. Oftentimes my underwear gets stained due to blood soaking through. I've heard that menstrual cups hold more blood than pads and tampons, which makes me interested in trying it. I've never used a tampon or menstrual cup, and so I'm nervous about it. However, the pros outweigh the cons for me.\n\n\nAnother reason I'm interested is because my family is going camping in a few days and I'm due to start my period during that time. My period being heavy is difficult enough, going camping while using pads is miserable. \n\n\nQuestion One: How do you know if you've inserted the menstrual cup in the right hole? I want to make sure it goes in my vagina, not urethra.\n\n\nQuestion Two: From what I've read some people have higher cervices than others, which impacts which size cup you should get. How do I figure out how high mine is? I've read that you tell by basically feeling around up there with your finger, but is there another way to figure out? \n\n\nQuestion Three: Should I wear a pad as well when using the cup for the first time, in case it leaks? \n\n\nQuestion Four: I heard that you clean menstrual cups by boiling it. Are there other alternatives? (The majority of the people in my family are boys, so boiling it using the same silverware that they use will probably be a no from them).  \n\n\nThank you!

I'm not sure if it could've been an alien or not but I have no idea what or who it could've been.\n\nI want to start out saying that I'm 17 so I was probably about 12 or 13 during this time. Anyways, this took place during the middle of the night over the summer. So I originally shared a room with my younger sister, we had bunk beds and I slept on the top. Now I wanna mention how my house and room are set up. There's only two windows in my room, one on the wall opposite of my bed. That window is about a 3 inches taller than me and I'm 5'1 and it outlooks the driveway of my neighbor's house. The other window outlooks the backyard and is about 2 feet tall and probably about 6 feet wide. It is only about 3 feet off the ground and the bunk bed is on the left of this window. Now behind my backyard isn't a road or anything, behind it is another backyard to another house. Now that I have painted a bit of a picture here what happened. So I'm sleeping where I usually sleep, the top bunk of my bed. I'm typically not the type of person to wake up in the middle of the night out of nowhere but that's exactly what I did. I woke up to a bright light shining into my room. the light took up the whole size of the window out looking the backyard, and the light appeared to be moving horizontally so across my whole house because I had seen the light through the window across the room from me. I had also seen the light outside of that window on my neighbor's house in my neighbors driveway. So basically the light took up my whole room and it went across the whole room at a perfect pace and speed, then it was onto the next house. I hadn't looked at id but it definitely had to have been from some type of a flying object because how tf is a light that big gonna be shinning through my window that night and take up my whole room. Damn light took up that wide ass window. I talked to my dad about what I saw because I couldn't think of what it was. He tried to say it was possibly a helicopter but I hadn't heard any noises, just seen a bright light shining through my window as if it was searching in our house. I don't know if this could've been an alien or not but I have no idea what it was. All I know is that something was shining through my window that night, and more than likely through others. I was too scared to look out the window. Do any of you reddit users might know what this could've been or what you think about this? I talked to all my friends about it and they thought it was weird and couldn't explain it either.

I'll put a tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nMy whole life, my parents tried to cram it into my head to save money. From the time I was 13 they had me out in the hot summers mowing lawns for years, immediately taking the money I earned and putting it into a savings account at a local credit union where I couldn't touch it until I was 18. They wouldn't tell me how much I had saved, but repeatedly told me how the bank adds money to the account too, (interest) so I'll have a lot of money when I get older and I can put it towards college.\n\nAt 16 I got my first job. Part time, minimum wage, but I was making a few hundred dollars per paycheck. By the time I was 18 I had moved up the ranks into retail and was working full time for about a dollar more than minimum. I was used to having steady income by this point. So imagine my dismay when on my 18th birthday, I went to the bank to withdraw the money I had saved, only to learn that over those three years busting my ass in the heat, and hearing about how I could take college classes with the money, I discovered I earned a whopping...$300. \n\nSo that got me really upset. I did all that work and by the time I was able to use the money, it had lost its value to me because I was an adult and $300 was a small amount by then. I earned twice that much in a month with my job in retail. I started thinking about how its my money that I worked hard for and I should be able to reward myself. That money is a reward for working so hard. I hated the taste that experience at the bank left with me, saving my money for so long, reminding myself for years that once I can take it out I'll be able to do big things with it, only to find out it was hardly anything. I hated saving money.\n\nNow I'm 25, rent an apartment with my boyfriend, and I still hate saving money. I live paycheck to paycheck, I have no savings at all. I go to work, earn my money, and the second I get my paycheck I put it towards rent and some other bills, but then I blow the rest. I use it to buy myself food when I'm hungry, anything I had wanted over the last few weeks I would most likely go out and buy.\n\nToday I sold a flatscreen TV I had sitting around for $180. I immediately filled up my gas tank for $30, then I went to savers and got some adorable carousel horse figurines, a water bowl for my dog, a few other things and somehow spent $50. Then I went to walmart and bought some craft supplies (trying to start a business, go figure) for about $20. Finally I went to the dollar store for more craft supplies, $6. Somehow I went through most of that money and now I only have maybe $60 left. My boyfriend is really mad at me, he says he's getting really worried about my spending habits, and I don't know what to do. I know it's a problem, and I need to change, but I have no idea how to break this habit. It's not like I'm buying useless stuff for no reason. I collect horse figurines and Savers is cheap so I love to go hunting there. I have a shelf for them all and I love to look at them. I buy things that make me happy consistently, I don't buy novelty items just for the hell of it, so it's not like I'm spending money just to get rid of it. \n\nMostly the idea of putting money away in a savings account makes me feel really depressed because while I get its important to have savings, I'm sitting at home bored off my ass watching tv when I could be out doing fun things like taking train rides, going to that fancy place for dinner that I've never been to, seeing a movie, and just living life. I'd rather experience things and make memories than sit at home with my money in the bank thinking \"gee, I wish I could use that savings to go out and do a fun thing, but oh well. At least if something horrendous happens, I'll probably have enough money to deal with it.\" Now I make $11 an hour so it's not like I have any money leftover after bills to put towards saving, it would only maybe be a hundred bucks.\n\nI just don't know where to go from here guys, I need some kind of direction in my life. I make $11 an hour and work 32 hours a week. Rent is $760\/month. Internet is $75\/month. Gas $30 a month. Power $20 a month, and groceries are $150-200 a month. I have a $2000 credit card that went to collections that I haven't made a payment on. And finally I have a loan for around $1300, $100 goes to that a month.\n\nI don't know how to budget, I used to keep receipts for everything when I moved into this new apartment. I was going to try and get a jump start on finances, but after a year of receipt saving I asked my parents what to do with them (they save receipts too, that's where I learned it from) and they said \"just throw them away. that's all.\" So why was I ever saving them?\n\nHelp me guys, I really want to change and just feel hopeless and lost right now. :(\n\ntl;dr traumatic experience as a kid with a savings account made me realize I hate saving money, and now I have no idea how to start saving money when it's important.

I wanted to share my story, get some feedback, and maybe some help if possible. Buckle up, this'll be a long ride.\n\nMy parents divorced when I was 6, and shortly after, my mom married my stepdad who is over a decade younger than her. This story will focus on them, leaving out my dad and stepmom. Anyway, things were fine til I turned about 12 or so, at which point everything suddenly took a turn. Maybe it was my developing personality thanks to puberty, but it was like a switch flipped in my stepdad's mind. And later, my mom's.\n\nFast forward a few years to high school. Stepdad and I argue constantly, and nothing I do is ever good enough. I try to talk to mom about it, but to no avail. Then college begins. I'm lucky enough to get a full ride with some money left over. I can't afford to live on my own so I'm stuck living at home. Stepdad is either very friendly or very moody, and the tiniest things I do, he criticizes. Mom finally takes my side and we all talk about it. He promises to change.\n\nNow I'm 21, just turned 21 in January. I'm dating a man who's 25, and we plan to get married eventually. He treats me with such love and compassion that I almost don't know how to react. For the first few months of our relationship, I was extremely cautious because I thought he'd suddenly flip. Stepdad and I argue on a almost daily basis. He makes things up (has his whole life but mom doesn't realize. Beat up an entire gang of 4 people by yourself? Yeah, right), including saying that I'm doing all sorts of weird or bad things, making me out to be a villian who treats him like shit. Mom doesn't notice or care, I'm not sure which. And on top of that, mom recently made me write her a check for all the money in my bank account, other than $25, because I \"couldn't handle having money.\"\n\nI'm out of the house as much as possible, but I'm going crazy when I'm stuck at home. I've been suicidal for years, and am only now getting treatment. My boyfriend, who knows all about this and supports me and helps with my mental health, even when I'm unintentionally hateful, plans to propose in October. I wanted to wait til I graduate in May to move out, but I'm not sure I can wait. I don't think I can handle it. At the same time, I have no money thanks to mom, and my car will barely run, so a job may not work. What should I do? Please give me some kind words or advice fellow Redditors. I'm at my wit's end.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_subscribers":293727,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Am I Crazy, or are They?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/8v6oxl\/am_i_crazy_or_are_they\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I'm 15 and I have severe anxiety (this is sometimes both social\/general\/etc) and depression. I began down this spiral in 6th grade, and dealt with all of the pain through cutting. (My parents eventually found out about this but took some time to take it seriously.) I left public school in the middle of 8th grade because the police came to our house to do a welfare check because I had been talking to an (ex)friend about killing myself. (They offered to give me meds that would definitely kill me(I realize now how terrible this person was now ofc)) I stayed about the same for awhile (maybe 4 months?) And eventually started seeing my therapist.\n\nLong story short I havent had much improvement at all. I can see my trail of thoughts has improved the most. My meds have changed alot over the course of this year and a half as well, and about a month ago I thought they were helping. (Depression-wise atleast..) \n\nOn Wednesday the 13th of June we lost one of our dogs to an infection in her uterus. She was still a puppy, only 8 months old. Honestly the whole thing has been eating my up inside. My heart aches for her so so much. I start to sob when I think about how I can't hold her anymore, or how she wasnt at home or with us when she died. (she was at the vet) I wanted to hold her so bad. My parents didn't want me to see her\/open the little coffin they had put her in. My mom said, \"once you pick her up you'll not wanna put her down.\" So I said okay through tears and we buried her in the backyard. \n\nMy anxiety is reminding me how she was alone, how she is in the ground and her body is decaying slowly.\n\nI know in my heart I'll see her one day but.. I dont want to wait. I want to hold her *now*. Ever since I lost her I havent been the same.\n\nStraying away from that specific part... my therapist\/parents are still pushing me to go out more. Half the time I really dont mind being at home at all. I like being by myself. My therapist has asked me before to ask myself if what I'm doing helps me become who I want to be and I realized today that I dont want to be anything. I dont want to be here or alive. I simply dont want to exist.\n\nI still feel so tired of everything and my mom confuses the hell out of me by telling me she understands and comforting me and the next thing I know it she's yelling at me telling me I dont do anything.\n\nI'm writing this on a Saturday night when the dreading of church in the morning is creeping up on me and I begin to feel like I cant do it at all. \n\nI'm just tired, I guess.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Anxiety","subreddit_id":"t5_2qmij","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Anxiety","subreddit_subscribers":193622,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"is it ever going to get better?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Anxiety\/comments\/8v6r7f\/is_it_ever_going_to_get_better\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

Too many girls feel trapped in a submissive lifestyle (no hate though, we all have our roles) and those who want to dom tend to ask for payment, which I cannot provide (again, no hate, you do you).  What I have found in the past however, is that girls who like to switch it up are the most fun.\n\nA little bit about me.  I'm 5'11, medium length very sandy blond hair, a thin build with just enough muscle to not look gross, and the palest skin you'll see in the next 25 years.  I'm fairly nerdy, but I don't let it control my life.  I'm in college, but currently on summer break, working a part time job.\n\nWhat I am looking for is two fold.  If you are located in or within an hour drive of either Tallahassee or Saint Augustine, I would love to grow from an online relationship into something in person.  If you are farther away, I love online relationships as well, but video calls will be a must.  I want more than just sex though, I want someone to talk to every day about the mundane aspects of everyday life, before getting down and dirty.  You should be either female or a fully transitioned MtF transgirl, guys, please don't waste my and your time.  My age range is 18-30, though I might consider higher if I really like you. Kinks will be discussed when you message me, mostly because I have too many to list on this ad!\n\nI know that there are dozens of guys on here looking for similar things.  I know I'm not special and unique any more than the other 20 ads posted in the next hour.  But, if you think we could have fun, shoot me a message, I'll be happy to answer you!  I hope to talk soon!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BDSMpersonals","subreddit_id":"t5_2smyd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BDSMpersonals","subreddit_subscribers":43532,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"19[M4F] Young Switch Seeking Fellow Switch for Online or Local LTR","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BDSMpersonals\/comments\/8v6w97\/19m4f_young_switch_seeking_fellow_switch_for\/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}

I started every morning with 4 eggs and 3 pieces of bacon, I'm 6'8 and currently 232 haha. Then for lunch I'd have a salad sometimes with tuna and bacon bits, and for dinner a chicken breast with an avocado, and another side. I did this for a while and would switch it off with 80\/20 burgers, or occasionally chipotle bowls. I'm 19, and a college student, that isn't very good at cooking. I'm finding it very hard to get lot's of fat intake and create simple meals as I work for the summer full-time until I get back to school, I love keto and the benefits that I've been getting from it. I just currently feel stuck, and don't have the money to always buy expensive meats etc... to cook meals, the broke college student in me is stressed out! haha.

Plan on doing basics at a community college then transferring. I did pretty well in high school, graduating magna cum laude along with a lot of leadership positions and a lot of college credit earned through dual credit and AP testing. Despite this and the fact that I could probably be almost anyone I wanted to be, I just want to be an AP history teacher.\n\nEvery single member of my family and older friends have told me this is a terrible idea, and for a while I just ignored them, but then I just had a talk with my father. He says that I can't survive as a teacher with 30 thousand per year, and that it would take decades to reach a reasonable salary. He ran some numbers off the top of his head: apartment is 1100 a month, car is 500, insurance for a young person like me is 150, and basically said I'm screwed as a teacher unless I get married early on. Meanwhile he said I could get a business degree and get picked up by a company such as United Health Care (the company he works for), get a job at 50 thousand starting salary after only 2 years of schooling, and then get the rest of my tuition paid by the company. Or I could be a nurse, an X-ray tech, or a radiologist, all with reasonable salaries.\n\nThey all say that it's better to pick a better paying job that I might not enjoy as opposed to a poor paying passion, and at first I didn't care. I figured I'd be fine living in an apartment eating rice and beans every day for the rest of my life if it meant I could be an AP teacher, but if I can barely survive in the first place without getting married early on or getting a second job, is it really worth it? Maybe the comfort of a better paying job is worth it?\n\nThis has me very distressed, so I hope for some advice and pointers as to what I should do and if what my friends and family say is true.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"careerguidance","subreddit_id":"t5_2t9i0","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/careerguidance","subreddit_subscribers":46697,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I want to be a high school teacher but everyone tells me it's a bad idea, is being a teacher really that bad and not worth it?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/careerguidance\/comments\/8v6yxm\/i_want_to_be_a_high_school_teacher_but_everyone\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Though it feels like we've been together for years, we're still getting to know each other more since we practically met two months ago (at the end of April). As of late I noticed that he lovesss to make comments about pretty much every girl w a \"fat ass\" he sees on the street (fyi we both work and spend our time w each other in NYC).\n\nAnother instance was while I was on the phone w him to meet up, he was telling me how two thots (excuse my lack for a better word aha) were completely topless and said that one of them had a nice rack, telling me to \"hurry up so I can see for myself\" what nice of a rack she had. My immediate reaction was to be bothered by this and he told me to stop being insecure.\n\nHe might've tried to lowkey be funny or whatever, but this is personally one of my biggest pet peeves when men always feel the need to murmur objectifying remarks every time they see a girl with her ass hangin out or with a video vixen body, even if it's under their breath. And what annoys me the most I guess is that he is my boyfriend and hearing him saying this kind of stuff makes me feel disrespected because it's like he doesn't have eyes for me but for whatever female out there that catches his attention as well.\n\nI have confronted him about his actions and told him they make me feel uncomfortable, and his response was that it's good to share when he sees a nice booty with me because he ASSUMES that I would WANT to get in on it too, because I am a female. And also says that he's JUST admiring beauty and that girls do it all the time so I shouldn't be mad. That's his logic. Now this is a guy who fully supports polygamy and has been in a polyamorous relationship before. Idk if that has anything to do with it but.\n\nI guess my main question is, am I really just being too insecure\/jealous? And is his logic justifiable for his typical male behavior?  I'll admit that I definitely know I can be very insecure and have many body insecurities about being too petite and skinny, etc, which is part of the reason why I do get kinda jealous when he points out another girl w bigger assets.\n\nBut if he is in a monogamous and committed relationship with me, is it okay for him to be deliberately 'objectifying' other random women in the street and then sometimes running it by me? Is that disrespectful of him or I'm just being too uptight?\n\nThanks for reading\/responding, plz I need as much input as I can (even if it's just yes or no)!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationship_advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0cn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/relationship_advice","subreddit_subscribers":777226,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"BF thinks it's okay to point out a girl's booty\/assets to me, and calls me insecure when I get mad about it?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/8v6zaw\/bf_thinks_its_okay_to_point_out_a_girls\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Before surgery to remove my left thyroid gland in November of 2017, I weighed between 125-129lbs. Doctors said my right thyroid gland would kick in and pick up the slack of the missing gland. It didn't. I had to wait months before they would start me on levothyroxozine because they kept insisting it would kick in. Long story short. I just started the meds but I now weigh 150lbs. I'm desperate to lose the weight quickly. I have mostly vintage clothes that were tailored to my old body and it's driving me crazy that I can't wear them. It will still be many months before they figure out the correct dose of medication. I already eat healthy foods but I want to restrict to 900-1100 calories a day. Has anyone done this? I feel like a stranger in my own body. Especially because my vintage clothes bring me such joy and I can't wear them.

Hopefully, with the recent sales and price drops, PSVR has found its sweet spot price wise to really take off. So far, I've just been playing the free demos, and I'm already in awe of what this tech has to offer. I'm 35, and this is the gaming experience I've been dreaming about since I was a child. \n\nIt also goes a little deeper than that for me, too. I became a father for the first time, three weeks ago. Unfortunately, me and the child\u2019s mother live in separate states, so I only get to see my daughter once, maybe twice a month, when I have the time off work to head out to see her. (The child\u2019s mother doesn't drive, so it's fully up to me to make the 10 hour round trip drive.) Not getting to be around my daughter is the absolute toughest thing I've ever gone through. Durring the weeks that I'm separated from her makes me sad. I'm also a little over 3 years sober, so there's that, too. Having something like VR, a technology that I dreamed of when I was a kid, helps to keep my mind busy, and helps to stave off falling deeper into depression.\n\nMore than that, the awesome PSVR community has been an immense help too, even if I have only been a lurker up till now. (I just created a reddit account today.) YouTube channels like Polish Paul, Frank, PSVR Without Parole, and this subreddit has shown me people just as excited for this tech as I am. I used to make YouTube videos myself, and I'm thinking of getting back into doing that, too :)\n\nPSVR is absolutely not a substitute for being around my daughter, nothing can be. But, I'd be doing her no good if I let myself fall into a pit of depression, and this has really helped. Thank you guys for providing such an awesome community to be a part of. I look forward to discovering all that PSVR has to offer with y'all!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PSVR","subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/PSVR","subreddit_subscribers":73204,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"New to the PSVR family, and it's seriously been a life saver!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/8v757z\/new_to_the_psvr_family_and_its_seriously_been_a\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Anon here. I'm 16. I live in a very rural right leaning town in Virginia. I've grown up being told that LGBT people are monsters and animals. My father knows I want to be an actor and he swears I'm going to be sexually assaulted by a gay man at some point in my career. For years, I too, thought LGBT people were evil. Then I met actual LGBT people. I realise they aren't evil like I've been told. They are just as human and amazing as anyone else. This was around 2 years ago. Over the past several months I've grown quite close to some of my male friends. This one guy drives me everywhere and we have lunch together. Nothing romantic, we are just bros. Yet, I have this feeling that I feel something different for him. Not sexual, but romantical. And my situation has become ever more confusing with my one friend. He is the man who got me to sing, the one who has encouraged me to go out and do my best as an actor. Recently, I did Little Shop of Horros and I was the voice of Audrey II and he was my puppeteer. We grew so close and personal with each other. I've gone to NYC two times the past several times, and he has been there with me each time (albeit with a large group). I find myself gravitating towards him. His charismatic and charming personality is so alluring. I'm feeling things I never felt before. I still love women, yet there is this side of me that yearns for not just women, but the love of a man. I'm so confused. I don't know what to do. If what I feel is true and my family or school mates find out I will be treated as sub human and ostracized. I don't know what to do. Thank you for reading this rather long post. Sorry, I'm just kind of ranty.\n\n[UPDATE] Well, it was my friends 18th birthday today. The one I have found myself deeply infsctusted with. We had a pool party. Holy. Fuck. Nuggets. This man had me stunned. And same with my other friend that was there. He had a nice six pack and muscles. I think I've found my calling.

I work in food service at $17\/hr. I live in a tiny apartment for $775 a month. I used to live with my parents and was debt free, but the 2.5 hr commute each way got to me and I decided to venture out on my own. I also got a serious boyfriend around that time and we throughly enjoyed the luxury of the city. Well, three years later I'm now about $20k in debt. We've broken up and I'm living closer to within my means, but the debt is making me panic. Im able to make the minimum payment, but I know the interest will fuck me the longer it hangs around. I've been getting a lot of mailers about personal loans recently. Normally I would ignore those as spam, but I'm wondering if they would actually be a good idea for me. The debt is affecting my credit score and I really don't like that.\n\n Obviously I was living well above my means and wasn't really paying attention to my financial health. I worked at a restaurant, which if anyone is familiar with, is a very stressful environment. That's not an excuse for my neglect of my finances, but I was very depressed and felt overwhelmed just going into work everyday.  I just ignored my problems and hoped they would go away. Finally I moved to a new job that paid a lot more, which removed some of the stress, but it's still not enough to erase my debt. I started going back to school part time so I can hopefully move into a different field, preferably one that pays better. But until that time comes in stuck on my shoe-string budget. It'll be 3 years before I graduate, and I don't want to let the interest pile up in that time. I'm going to a cuny school, so my financial aid pays for my classes, and it doesn't add to my bills. It does, however, mean I don't have the time to get a second job.\n\nIf I got a personal loan to knock out my debt asap, what are the best options? Are there larger cons to this that I haven't thought of? Any help or guidance on this subject would be very much appreciated. The interest rate on my credit card is 14.5%. I feel like that's pretty low but I don't actually know for sure.\n\nAnd if loans are a terrible idea (which they probably are), what is the best way to get out of debt as quickly as possible when you already live paycheck to paycheck?\n\nI make about $33k a year. \n\nMonthly bills:\nRent: $775 + $40 utilities\nCell phone:$80\nGym membership: $10 (thanks planet fitness!)\nStudent loans: $200","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/personalfinance","subreddit_subscribers":13214078,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"20k in debt, is personal loan the right path?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/8v79xj\/20k_in_debt_is_personal_loan_the_right_path\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Here's my list. \n\nOn looking young:\n\n* Well, I'm young for my age.\n* Since I was a kid, I've always been afraid of change. \n* (In response to \"you look so young!\") My grandchildren tell me the same thing. \n* (In response to \"you look so young!\") No I don't. You can't fool me with that line. Do I look like I was born yesterday?\n* (In response to \"you look so young!\") Thanks, I've been trying this new baby food diet.\n* I was born on February 29th; I've only had \\_\\_\\_ birthdays.\n* I'm actually 60, but when I was in college I volunteered in a lab testing anti-aging cream. (Gets fun responses from kids)\n* I tried to look older by wearing a tie every day, but I ended up looking like a kid from Dead Poets Society. (I say this as I teach high school; you could change the last part to fit your workplace, etc)\n* I'm the twin in the spaceship from Einstein's twin paradox. \n\nOn being short:\n\n* When I smoke weed, I get medium.\n* Dating is hard for a short guy. My dates never get past the small talk.\n* Don't make fun of my height - I've got a short temper.\n* I can still kick your ass at mini golf - or as I call it, golf. \n* (Deep breath in) There's so much more oxygen down here.\n* I may be short, but I'm not afraid of lightning.\n* I prefer the term \"down to earth\".\n* (Flirting situations) Want me to go up on you? (Brad Williams)\n* Shorter people have a shorter distance to fall. Statistically, we experience fewer broken bones than taller people.\n\nShare your best jokes!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ftm","subreddit_id":"t5_2t9mw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ftm","subreddit_subscribers":31285,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Handy list of jokes about looking young\/short","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ftm\/comments\/8v7ayr\/handy_list_of_jokes_about_looking_youngshort\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}
