My dad passed away at the beginning of my second year, and as such, I got 240$/month from the government pension, but that was only when I was a full time student. I withdrew from school entirely in December, so I will soon have to start paying back my student loans (2.5 years worth of loans). \n\nOther expenses I would include are fuel, food, personal items, and I would like to budget 50$/month for Magic the Gathering events as it is my once a week entertainment. As far as the others go, I have been fueling up what seems to be 20$ per week due to cold weather, and I honestly have no estimate on my food as I have not been keeping track. I try to spend less than 20$ every time I go to the grocery store, though, but I do visit Tim Hortons quite frequently. I would estimate that other personal items like shampoo etc would be 50$ per month, and clothing, hair cuts, etc would be another 100$ (50$/haircut and then upkeep of \"business casual\" clothing for work). Every three months I will need to fill a prescription of medicine and that will be about 30$. \n\nOne of the main concerns I have is that my paychecks come out every two weeks on the Friday, but my rent is due on the 1st of every month, I am almost always left with the one paycheck going 100% to my rent payment, leaving me with no spending money for the next two weeks. \n\nWhat I want to do is apply for Athabasca University courses such that I can work on completing some sort of degree, but I obviously do not have money for that. My mom has said that she will pay for courses for me, but she only gets about 500$/mo from my father's pension, does not work, and she would be dipping into her available 12,000$ that is left. Her other money is tied up in investments. I appreciate that, but I do not want to be more of a financial burden on her as I already frequently borrow money since I cannot make ends meet. \n\nI did however receive my ex's collectible Magic the Gathering cards when we broke up, and have no need for most of them, and would wager I could sell them for about 500-1000$ (optimistically, and if sold individually). \n\nI am willing to try and get a part time evening job, but I am not sure if companies would be willing to hire for those hours. \nOther than that, I am just looking for any kind of advice that could help me not stress so much about money and living.

I appreciate that, but I do not want to be more of a financial burden on her as I already frequently borrow money since I cannot make ends meet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did however receive my ex&amp;#39;s collectible Magic the Gathering cards when we broke up, and have no need for most of them, and would wager I could sell them for about 500-1000$ (optimistically, and if sold individually). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am willing to try and get a part time evening job, but I am not sure if companies would be willing to hire for those hours. \nOther than that, I am just looking for any kind of advice that could help me not stress so much about money and living.

My info about this tragic accident has come from the little girl's older brother, about 60 years old now, who is friends with my mum.\n\nMoving on for the accident. My mum's house is set out in an odd way so bare with me whilst I describe the layout as best I can. The house has 3 floors, the first floor only has one room and a stair way leading up to the sitting room and kitchen on the second floor, the third floor is 2 bedrooms and a bathroom.\n\nThis is the first creepy thing about the house. On the door going into the room where the littel girl died, the first floor room, my mum discovered something written on the inside of the door in blue crayon. It was the name of the little girl, Lilly, or something like that, I haven't been there for a while so I can't really remember.\n\nUnfortunatly this is the least creepy thing happening in that house. I have had a personal encounter from what I believe is the little girl. I was watching tv late at night on the second floor at around 2am and I was smoking. I remember putting my blue lighter on the table in front of me so I could find it and use it with no problem, however, when I went to use it, it wasn't there. Just as fast as I realised it was gone, it dropped from directly above me and made me jump out of my skin. I know it's not much but that was my encounter.\n\nRecently my baby brother, Axl, ( 5 years old) has been refusing to sleep and claiming he is too scared to be in his room when it's dark. This is common enough for young childeren so me and my mum didn't think much of it, so we just put a night light in his room to make him feel better. For a while Axl was fine and went to bed, but this was short lived. One night my other brother, milo, (14 years old) went to mums and had to deal with Axl whilst mum was at the store. This is happening at like 9pm. Milo is watching tv on the second floor at this point and hears Axl crying and screaming. Milo goes upstairs asuming that Axl has had a nightmare or something. When he gets to Axl, he asks him whats wrong and gives him hugs. But what Axl said in response was chilling and creepy. He said \"There is a girl and she is scary\" Axl is pointing to the corner of the room where the night light can't reach. Milo quickly looks, obviously freaked out, and sees nothing. At this point Axl is still scared and is still claiming she is there. Milo manages to calm him down and get him to sleep eventually and goes back to watching tv downstairs.\n\nWhenever any of us stay at my mum's, we all feel like something is there and watching.\n\nI will try to find out more about the accident and if anything else creepy happens there, I will add it. Also maybe some advice to help Axl feel better or anything would be really helpful!\n\nEdit: I'd like to thank everyone for the kind advice, I wasn't expecting this many people to even read my story. So thank you guys for the support. So here's an update on whats going on. A couple of days after writing this story I decided to go to my mum's house and ask some more question. I asked my mum if the ghost's brother would come over but she said he doesn't want to becuase it's only got bad memories in it. I found out that he had actually had two other brothers die in that house as well as the little girl. One of his brothers died from drowning on the ground floor due to flooding and the other died from an illness related to the poor damp conditions of the house. I also have to correct myself, the little girl was not called Lilly, she was called Izzy. Here is a link to the picture I took of the door. http://imgur.com/a/3DIn0\n\nWhilst I was taking this picture something odd happened. Me and my mum were downstairs looking at the door, she was talking to me about where the fire place was that Izzy had died in. After I took the picture of the door, me we went into the ground room to look at the old fire place, it was patched up buy some thin wood that had been painted over to match the wall. It's weird because there is actually another fire place in that room, a newer one, to replace the other, even though it could have been used. So about 2 minutes after walking into the room me and my mum heard something. It was loud and it made us both jump, I look out of the room and saw the disjoined door, with Izzy's name on it, Violently shaking it as if someone were behind it shaking it with their arms. No one else was in the house except for me and my mum and my baby brother Axl, who was fast asleep in his room on the second floor. I jumped straight into my mums arms and we both screamed. The shaking wasn't stopping though so we mustered up the courage and ran past it up the stairs. For the rest of the night me and my mum kept seeing the black shape of a small person, I assume a child, peeking out from the corners of the sitting room on the first floor. I am ashamed to admit it but, I, a 17 year old, had to sleep in his mum's bed that night. I will keep updating if anything else happens.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So to start this off I would like to say that this story is true and I will try to find some evidence and add it to my story.

I come from a conservative family and knew in high school that they would not take it well.

I even told my brother, who was very chill about it. Over the years however I have noticed my parent's attitudes about some things begin to change. My mom especially began to talk about diversity more and ask me a lot of questions about my gay and trans friends.\n\nI began to suspect they knew as my mom made a point to tell me positive stories she would see on the news about LGBT topics or things like that.

This is my first post to this sub, and I am 16 years old and love vintage macs, unfortunately I don't have any that are working. I have my mom's Macintosh Plus 1MB, missing it's keyboard and it used to have an external \"Cutting Edge\" brand SCSI hard drive, but when I was really young and didn't know what I was doing, I took it apart and lost the drive..and I always wanted to get another drive. A Cutting Edge one would be nice, but any external SCSi drive with an OS for the Plus would work, and I have a case for one from an old SCSI CD drive I could fit a bare drive in, so if anyone has one, I am desperate to get mine going! \n\nI also am pretty disappointed because I lost an eBay auction on a working mint PowerBook 180, and these are very rare to find working, and eventually I would really like to get a vintage 100 series PowerBook.

This is my first post to this sub, and I am 16 years old and love vintage macs, unfortunately I don&amp;#39;t have any that are working. I have my mom&amp;#39;s Macintosh Plus 1MB, missing it&amp;#39;s keyboard and it used to have an external &amp;quot;Cutting Edge&amp;quot; brand SCSI hard drive, but when I was really young and didn&amp;#39;t know what I was doing, I took it apart and lost the drive..and I always wanted to get another drive. A Cutting Edge one would be nice, but any external SCSi drive with an OS for the Plus would work, and I have a case for one from an old SCSI CD drive I could fit a bare drive in, so if anyone has one, I am desperate to get mine going! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also am pretty disappointed because I lost an eBay auction on a working mint PowerBook 180, and these are very rare to find working, and eventually I would really like to get a vintage 100 series PowerBook.

This will be a long post...but here goes.\n\nTo make a long story short, I've been having some really bad anxiety and depression for months. I was robbed at gun point in broad daylight before work one morning in August of 2017. I took a couple days off after the crime occurred. I always have told myself to just tough things out and get over it - however this time I just can't. A few months before the robbery, I started a new job at this company that was \"changing its culture\" and had \"lots of growth potential.\" It's in a very intense industry and we all have pretty overwhelming work loads on our plates. \n\nI've been seeing a therapist since the robbery occurred and also my psychiatrist quarterly. My therapist said I do, without a doubt, have PTSD from the robbery. I've been trying to do my best at work, but as we keep having turnover and the company is going through a rocky period, more work has been dumped on my plate. I never have been a crier, but I find myself crying weekly at work. I have IBS and also find myself feeling sick to my stomach often while at work. \n\nA little backstory about the company... in November, the President/co-owner was fired. In December, the most tenured employee on my team quit, along with another lead. In March, my counterpart quit. In the last week, we lost our main product developer AND the Director of Marketing and Outside Sales. I know of at least 5-7 other people at this small company trying to get out. \n\nMy boss has been less than helpful. She is aware of what I am going through and the struggles I am having, however when I do go to her for problems, I'm told to figure it out. She's actually never held my job, so she doesn't really understand all that goes into it day in and day out for the accounts I manage and why the workload is unmanageable. One day, she told me that we all have the same work loads and that's not changing. I was told to \"get it together.\" The next day, she asked me if I'd had any \"water works\" because the previous day she caught my crying in my cubicle out of stress and frustration. \n\nRecently, my boss has implemented a stricter 2 week notice policy for any appointments/personal things outside of the office besides emergencies just coming up. This makes it THAT much harder to even schedule interviews. \n\nI've thought about finding a new job, which I am working on, however I truthfully don't know how much longer I can take it there. Currently, I am 25 about to be 26, I am on my parent's health insurance (so thankful for that!). As I turn 26 in the next month, I will be losing my health insurance through my parents. Since I'm not on my employer's insurance at this point, if I do quit in the next week or so, I don't think I could even qualify for COBRA. I'm concerned I won't be able to afford my medications if I enter the marketplace for insurance. \n\nBesides the insurance worry, I don't have a new job lined up. I was thinking of taking a few weeks to just focus on getting my mind right again and really focus on moving my life forward from the robbery. I'm worried that employers will see a month or two employment gap and wonder what I've been doing or if I will not be looked at for jobs because of it. \n\nIn the next month, my mother will be having her 3rd back surgery and I am also moving - so having some additional time off during this time period would be so helpful. \n\nSo...I just want advice. Do employers really look at employment gaps? How do I best explain my potential gap in employment to prospective future employers? What is the best way for me to handle putting in my notice? Does anyone have any advice about getting health insurance through the marketplace? Is it relatively common for people to quit their jobs due to mental health?\n\nThanks everyone, I truly appreciate your advice and support. \n\n","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could really use some life/career advice.

I&amp;#39;m worried that employers will see a month or two employment gap and wonder what I&amp;#39;ve been doing or if I will not be looked at for jobs because of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the next month, my mother will be having her 3rd back surgery and I am also moving - so having some additional time off during this time period would be so helpful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So...I just want advice. Do employers really look at employment gaps? How do I best explain my potential gap in employment to prospective future employers? What is the best way for me to handle putting in my notice? Does anyone have any advice about getting health insurance through the marketplace? Is it relatively common for people to quit their jobs due to mental health?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks everyone, I truly appreciate your advice and support. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"jobs","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhnd","subreddit_subscribers":174517,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Will it damage my future career prospects if I leave my current position because of my mental health?","ups":2,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/88nzwr/will_it_damage_my_future_career_prospects_if_i/","user_reports":[],"visited":false,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I had posted this on a another non-reddit forum a few days ago.  Man, I wish I'd found this forum months ago, I'm adding in a few details here that you guys will probably relate to.  \n\nI've been in a relationship with a woman for almost 2 years. I'm 36, she's 28. It's not quite long distance, but we are about 2 hours apart so we only see each other 2 or 3 times a week. She gets nervous talking on the phones, but we texted almost constantly throughout our days during that time.  I think she needed constant assurance what I was doing, and in a way I got used to it and enjoyed talking with her almost constantly.  We did occasionally spend the weekend with each other and we take vacations together. We also each have two kids. Up until this breakup, we had plans for me to sell my home and move about an hour closer to bridge the distance, and had plans to vacation this summer with all of the kids together.\n\nDuring that time, we've broken up for a couple of days about 3 or 4 times. Over the course of the relationship, she had confided in me that she was bipolar and knew being with her would be a challenge. She said her doctor had never confirmed the bipolar diagnosis, just suspected and was certain she suffered from depression and anxiety. They've tried her on several different meds, some seem to work for a while, but eventually her body adjusts and they no longer work.  After 2 years I'm convinced she has borderline personality disorder.  I've tried my best to deal with it, but in the end followed every pattern I've read about for that type of relationship.\n\nOur first breakup was over Valentine's day 2017. I was sick and couldn't spend it with her, so she overreacted extremely. We didn't speak for 3 days of her giving me the silent treatment but eventually reconciled. This seemed to be the pattern, as any time a conflict arose, even a minor one over something as simple as a disagreement over what to do on a certain weekend, she would get disproportionately angry. Rather than talking to resolve the conflict, her method of dealing with it would be 2 or 3 days of silent treatment. She would tell me to lose her number and don't contact her. Sometimes I would get a text from her saying she's sorry and didn't mean it, others I would have to drive to see her to reconcile. I had hoped this behavior would get better, but it never seemed to change. I stuck it out because when times were good, they were very good. We went to music festivals together, beach trips, and had several date nights every week for 2 years that were wonderful. We were in almost constant contact via text. In some ways, I don't think I've ever met someone I had so much in common with.  And of course, the ridiculously good crazy-girl sex, sometimes in public, and quite often kinky.\n\nThere were other issues that I (stupidly, I know) overlooked. She has a drinking problem, but won't admit it. She's great fun when we're out, but sometimes will have 1 or 2 before we go and I won't realize till she's drunk that she hasn't \"only had 3\". She also drinks a couple times during the week home alone, which I view as unhealthy. \n\nWhen I met her, she had quit smoking, but started back up again when she started a new job that was stressful.  She didn't tell me this and hid it for about 6 months.  When I eventually found out, she \"quit for me\" but she would start up again for a few days whenever we were not speaking during an argument.\n\nShe definitely has an anger problem, and can be triggered by just about anything. She ran out and got a tattoo, I hated it, we fought about it. And she has lots of stories of family abuse, which I am now starting to question. And extreme insecurity issues to where the slightest criticism or anything that can be viewed as such is a huge argument. \n\nFriday two weeks ago, I thought we were in a really good place. We hadn't been fighting, we had vacation plans for 4 or 5 trips this summer, and were a week away from one of her kids birthday parties, which for the first time I was going to be bringing both of my kids to be around her whole family at once. To me this seemed like a huge step, as we don't often have them all together. I was, oddly enough, really happy that day. At some point during the evening I commented on how much fun we had when we were out drinking the night before. She then started crying and saying \"You don't find me attractive, you don't want to f* me unless you're drunk\". I tried to comfort her and assure her this was not the case, after all we were together several times a week for 2 years, often in the car if we couldn't make the drive to each others home, so the very suggestion to me was ridiculous, but nothing I could say was good enough and it eventually lead to her hysterically yelling \"get out of my car\" in a restaurant parking lot.  I was afraid she would drive off with me in it, or hit me (she had never before, but she was hysterical), so I eventually complied and said \"I can't deal with this crazy anymore. Maybe this time I'll block you for a couple of days\"\n\nI tried to contact her a few days later to make up as we had before, but she wouldn't answer the phone. I only got two texts back, both hostile, telling me to lose her number and leave her alone. Considering she says this every time during the push/pull cycle, I wasn't surprised, but didn't think she meant it.  The next week was our kids birthday parties and I didn't want to deal with any drama during those, but the next weekend I drove 2 hours to see her and attempt to reconcile as we always had before. Or so I thought. She was home but wouldn't even answer the door. I got a text from her telling me to leave or she would call the cops. Walking away I glanced in her car and saw two things: Cigarettes, she had started smoking again. And empty condom wrappers, not the kind we ever bought. I sent her a text back about this, she claimed they were ours, but of course I know better and am 100% certain on this.  The next day, she had changed her phone number.\n\nI'm so confused now. I don't know if she was cheating on me the whole time or just moved on within a week. But I began to question a lot of her stories. Typical BPD stuff, claims to have been a rape victim as a child, claims to have found her brother and saved his life after he shot himself in a suicide attempt.  Who knows if they were true and caused her to be this way, or if those were attention getting.  She had said her children's father was a heroin addict who never tried to see them and couldn't keep a cell phone to even call and ask about them. She said he only calls when he can borrow a phone at work. On a whim, I called an old number he had called me from 2 years ago that I had in my old phone. Turns out, he's had the same cell number this whole time. He said she blocked his number and he has to call from a different one to get thru, but she won't let him see his kids. \n\nI'm not sure how mentally to get over this. There was no conversation to have any sort of closure here. It was like things were finally perfect one minute and we were planning a future, the next she has a breakdown, and now she hates me. From everything I read on BPD I'm now \"split black\" and there will never be any discussion with her that will tell me why. There's a part of her I still love, but I'm starting to question how much of what I knew about her was real. Thought about writing a letter that might be better received since she won't allow a face to face conversation. She hasn't spoken a word to me since that night, just a few hostile texts, and threats of a restraining order. I know wanting her back is unhealthy, but I could move on a lot easier if I just knew what happened.\n\nSorry if this rambles a bit.  2 years of hell condensed into one post.  Any comments and all advice welcome. ","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may end up a long post, so I apologize in advance and hope a few will read.

She said her doctor had never confirmed the bipolar diagnosis, just suspected and was certain she suffered from depression and anxiety. They&amp;#39;ve tried her on several different meds, some seem to work for a while, but eventually her body adjusts and they no longer work.  After 2 years I&amp;#39;m convinced she has borderline personality disorder.  I&amp;#39;ve tried my best to deal with it, but in the end followed every pattern I&amp;#39;ve read about for that type of relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our first breakup was over Valentine&amp;#39;s day 2017. I was sick and couldn&amp;#39;t spend it with her, so she overreacted extremely. We didn&amp;#39;t speak for 3 days of her giving me the silent treatment but eventually reconciled. This seemed to be the pattern, as any time a conflict arose, even a minor one over something as simple as a disagreement over what to do on a certain weekend, she would get disproportionately angry. Rather than talking to resolve the conflict, her method of dealing with it would be 2 or 3 days of silent treatment. She would tell me to lose her number and don&amp;#39;t contact her. Sometimes I would get a text from her saying she&amp;#39;s sorry and didn&amp;#39;t mean it, others I would have to drive to see her to reconcile. I had hoped this behavior would get better, but it never seemed to change. I stuck it out because when times were good, they were very good. We went to music festivals together, beach trips, and had several date nights every week for 2 years that were wonderful. We were in almost constant contact via text. In some ways, I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever met someone I had so much in common with.  And of course, the ridiculously good crazy-girl sex, sometimes in public, and quite often kinky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were other issues that I (stupidly, I know) overlooked. She has a drinking problem, but won&amp;#39;t admit it. She&amp;#39;s great fun when we&amp;#39;re out, but sometimes will have 1 or 2 before we go and I won&amp;#39;t realize till she&amp;#39;s drunk that she hasn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;only had 3&amp;quot;. She also drinks a couple times during the week home alone, which I view as unhealthy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I met her, she had quit smoking, but started back up again when she started a new job that was stressful.  She didn&amp;#39;t tell me this and hid it for about 6 months.  When I eventually found out, she &amp;quot;quit for me&amp;quot; but she would start up again for a few days whenever we were not speaking during an argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She definitely has an anger problem, and can be triggered by just about anything. She ran out and got a tattoo, I hated it, we fought about it. And she has lots of stories of family abuse, which I am now starting to question. And extreme insecurity issues to where the slightest criticism or anything that can be viewed as such is a huge argument. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Friday two weeks ago, I thought we were in a really good place. We hadn&amp;#39;t been fighting, we had vacation plans for 4 or 5 trips this summer, and were a week away from one of her kids birthday parties, which for the first time I was going to be bringing both of my kids to be around her whole family at once. To me this seemed like a huge step, as we don&amp;#39;t often have them all together. I was, oddly enough, really happy that day. At some point during the evening I commented on how much fun we had when we were out drinking the night before. She then started crying and saying &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t find me attractive, you don&amp;#39;t want to f* me unless you&amp;#39;re drunk&amp;quot;. I tried to comfort her and assure her this was not the case, after all we were together several times a week for 2 years, often in the car if we couldn&amp;#39;t make the drive to each others home, so the very suggestion to me was ridiculous, but nothing I could say was good enough and it eventually lead to her hysterically yelling &amp;quot;get out of my car&amp;quot; in a restaurant parking lot.  I was afraid she would drive off with me in it, or hit me (she had never before, but she was hysterical), so I eventually complied and said &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t deal with this crazy anymore. Maybe this time I&amp;#39;ll block you for a couple of days&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to contact her a few days later to make up as we had before, but she wouldn&amp;#39;t answer the phone. I only got two texts back, both hostile, telling me to lose her number and leave her alone. Considering she says this every time during the push/pull cycle, I wasn&amp;#39;t surprised, but didn&amp;#39;t think she meant it.  The next week was our kids birthday parties and I didn&amp;#39;t want to deal with any drama during those, but the next weekend I drove 2 hours to see her and attempt to reconcile as we always had before. Or so I thought. She was home but wouldn&amp;#39;t even answer the door. I got a text from her telling me to leave or she would call the cops. Walking away I glanced in her car and saw two things: Cigarettes, she had started smoking again. And empty condom wrappers, not the kind we ever bought. I sent her a text back about this, she claimed they were ours, but of course I know better and am 100% certain on this.  The next day, she had changed her phone number.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so confused now. I don&amp;#39;t know if she was cheating on me the whole time or just moved on within a week. But I began to question a lot of her stories. Typical BPD stuff, claims to have been a rape victim as a child, claims to have found her brother and saved his life after he shot himself in a suicide attempt.  Who knows if they were true and caused her to be this way, or if those were attention getting.  She had said her children&amp;#39;s father was a heroin addict who never tried to see them and couldn&amp;#39;t keep a cell phone to even call and ask about them. She said he only calls when he can borrow a phone at work. On a whim, I called an old number he had called me from 2 years ago that I had in my old phone. Turns out, he&amp;#39;s had the same cell number this whole time. He said she blocked his number and he has to call from a different one to get thru, but she won&amp;#39;t let him see his kids. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how mentally to get over this. There was no conversation to have any sort of closure here. It was like things were finally perfect one minute and we were planning a future, the next she has a breakdown, and now she hates me. From everything I read on BPD I&amp;#39;m now &amp;quot;split black&amp;quot; and there will never be any discussion with her that will tell me why. There&amp;#39;s a part of her I still love, but I&amp;#39;m starting to question how much of what I knew about her was real. Thought about writing a letter that might be better received since she won&amp;#39;t allow a face to face conversation. She hasn&amp;#39;t spoken a word to me since that night, just a few hostile texts, and threats of a restraining order. I know wanting her back is unhealthy, but I could move on a lot easier if I just knew what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this rambles a bit.  2 years of hell condensed into one post.  Any comments and all advice welcome. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPDlovedones","subreddit_id":"t5_33dd6","subreddit_subscribers":10482,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My \"wtf just happened\" post","ups":4,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/88o0xr/my_wtf_just_happened_post/","user_reports":[],"visited":false,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

However, I also don&amp;#39;t have a lot of direction from my boss so I feel like i am just stumbling around, never really sure if what I am doing is correct or not. I have talked to my boss multiple times but they do not like to give direction and just want me to take care of it, which makes for a very unsettling experience day in and day out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel the new job would be lots of fun, but I am also not sure how successful I will be at it. I am also having a hard time with the idea of giving up a office where I can close my door at any time, never get out past 5pm and some days even get to leave early. On the other hand, I rarely take my lunch as I work through it whereas at the new job, most people would eat lunch together. I also know at my current job, I am capped and there is not anywhere else for me to go, while of course if I were to really understand data modeling and statistical analysis my future earning potential would only grow and as I am 30 years old, there is a lot working years I have left. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Benefits are about the same. My current gig has a better retirement option as they put in 10% for my 5% into a vanguard 2050 fund; whereas the new place only puts in 3% (no match is needed for this). However, the new place fully pays your health insurance while the current one charges $250/mo. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appreciate any advice you can give!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","subreddit_subscribers":12996814,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Should I Take the New Job?","ups":1,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/88o2ka/should_i_take_the_new_job/","user_reports":[],"visited":false,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I am 23 years old and I was raised by my grandparents. My mother had me when she was 19, and once she got her taste of freedom she began to struggle with alcoholism and some drug issues. My mother was adopted. It is well known in our family that my grandmother is extremely strict, She is a miserable woman who likes to bring others down with her. Misery loves its company. I was told that she was extremely strict and often times very mean to my mother in forms of emotional and verbal abuse.\n\nThe same things have happened with me as a result of her helping raise me. When I think of her all I can think of is how she is a ticking time bomb, who constantly alternates moods of extreme irritability and anger. She frequently gets her self so worked up that she screams, throws and breaks things. I don't have enough fingers to count the amount of names that I have been called. Along with everyone else in the house\u2026\n\nThroughout childhood she was extremely strict on me and would never allow me to hang out with friends outside of school or do much of anything outside of clubs that I belonged to or my job. Living in a house with her is like walking on egg shells. Her way of showing love is through material items which she uses as leverage to get her way.\n\nTo get to the point, I go to college one hour away from home, by the hardest, and only because she has many relatives in this town and is comfortable with it. Throughout the five years and I have been in school, I am required to call her multiple times a day or else I \"don't care about them and will regret this someday because they are old and going to die!!!!\" or \"After all that I have paid for and done for you you!!!!!!\" But that is not the worst of it, I got a boyfriend my first semester of college and she is extremely jealous that I spend time with him and his family occasionally. She often claims that they are brainwashing me because my boyfriend has taught me to stick up for myself and then I don't have to tolerate her abuse.\n\nAnyway, I am applying for medical school to be a doctor. This has caused extreme conflict. She is extremely jealous and mad that I would want to spend more time in school instead of time with her. I have been manipulated to feel as though I owe Her my entire life and all of his accomplishments. To be a successful medical applicant you should apply for schools all over the United States, I feel as though I'm stuck applying to the one school in my hometown and if I don't get in I'm totally fucked. Because of her I feel like I cannot apply to schools where I know I will be able to reach my fullest potential. My main concern is that when I graduate college in May she is requiring me to move back home. I feel as though I'm obligated to move home because of all the things that she has done for me. However it is causing me extreme emotional distress, to the point where I am considering going to my school's counseling center. I feel anxiety and sadness at the thought of moving back home. I know that I am an adult And can make my own decisions and do what is best for me\u2026 The problem is she has complete control over me financially by paying for my car insurance and phone bill. Of course she also supplied the car itself\u2026 I am extremely worried that she will completely cut me off and I'll be fucked financially and without a car. This is something that she would do, she acts out in anger in very extreme ways. All of my friends and my boyfriend or terribly worried about me having to move back and know that I will be miserable. My whole life, job, and happiness is in this town. I have no friends back at home only my two grandparents and the other family that I'm Only involved with during the holidays.\n\nThe days are passing by very quickly and graduation day is approaching fast. The thought of moving back makes me want to cry my eyes out and I know that it will affect every aspect of my life and happiness.

From my grandparents wanting me to move back, from my friends and boyfriend who know I won't be happy, from choosing between risking it all in applying to one school or doing what is best for my career, etc.\u2026\n\nI just need some insight....

I am currently driving a 2010 F150 Raptor now at 150,000 miles on it that my Dad purchased when I was 17. I'm incredibly lucky and grateful for this vehicle, but am now starting to think about taking care of myself financially (more later). He is going to \"give\" this to me for my birthday in a couple of weeks, as in put it in my name. He is planning on paying it off, around $15k, and then transferring it. It's a fantastic truck and I've had a lot of fun with it. No real mechanical issues to speak of. I'm 20 and am thinking I should possibly purchase a less expensive and higher mpg vehicle to last me through college and onto my first job. I travel quite a lot for various internships and because I\u2019m 20, in college, and it\u2019s fun. I'm not positive, but I believe I can get around $15-20k trade in for it.\n\nI am incredibly lucky (and grateful) that my financial situation is fairly secure due to being an engineering major and my father\u2019s support. I have done coops and internships and will be sitting on around $15k cash after this summer. I have no student loans and college is around $1600/year after scholarships. Housing/general living cost is provided by my father. I will be posting in personalfinance as well but I feel as if their recommendations will be to sell the Raptor, get a $5k reliable vehicle and put the rest of my money in a 401k so I can retire right out of college (joke, but you get the idea). I want to be responsible but I\u2019m still trying to be slightly young and stupid. Life\u2019s about a balance, right?  \nSo my question is what car should I get in the under $20k price range, or whether or not I should even trade in cars. Is having a fun but expensive car worth it at my age? Due to my academic performance and internships I am fairly confident in my ability to get a fairly well paying job post college (2 years left). \nDetails on what I would want if I decide to get a new car: Used luxury, BMW, Audi, Lexus, etc with highish mpg (20city/30hwy would be great) and fairly reliable. I realize German is high cost typically. This car will be used as my primary commuter for the rest of college. \n I\u2019m fairly flexible on what I would want, however and am looking to get some input and hear some opinions on what I should do!\n","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here is my situation.

I&amp;#39;m 20 and am thinking I should possibly purchase a less expensive and higher mpg vehicle to last me through college and onto my first job. I travel quite a lot for various internships and because I\u2019m 20, in college, and it\u2019s fun. I&amp;#39;m not positive, but I believe I can get around $15-20k trade in for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am incredibly lucky (and grateful) that my financial situation is fairly secure due to being an engineering major and my father\u2019s support. I have done coops and internships and will be sitting on around $15k cash after this summer. I have no student loans and college is around $1600/year after scholarships. Housing/general living cost is provided by my father. I will be posting in personalfinance as well but I feel as if their recommendations will be to sell the Raptor, get a $5k reliable vehicle and put the rest of my money in a 401k so I can retire right out of college (joke, but you get the idea). I want to be responsible but I\u2019m still trying to be slightly young and stupid. Life\u2019s about a balance, right?&lt;br/&gt;\nSo my question is what car should I get in the under $20k price range, or whether or not I should even trade in cars. Is having a fun but expensive car worth it at my age? Due to my academic performance and internships I am fairly confident in my ability to get a fairly well paying job post college (2 years left). \nDetails on what I would want if I decide to get a new car: Used luxury, BMW, Audi, Lexus, etc with highish mpg (20city/30hwy would be great) and fairly reliable. I realize German is high cost typically. This car will be used as my primary commuter for the rest of college. \n I\u2019m fairly flexible on what I would want, however and am looking to get some input and hear some opinions on what I should do!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"whatcarshouldIbuy","subreddit_id":"t5_2ys2t","subreddit_subscribers":26260,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"(USA) Help a college student pick a car","ups":0,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/88ocys/usa_help_a_college_student_pick_a_car/","user_reports":[],"visited":false,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}
