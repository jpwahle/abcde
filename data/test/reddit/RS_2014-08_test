I'd really like to cut some hair so give my post a read, hopefully give it an upvote, and if you're interested then shoot me a message. Feel free to also comment or message if you just have any questions. Thanks! \n\nI have a fetish for women's hair. This includes styling, brushing, washing, curling, playing with, and most of all cutting. \n\nIt's been quite some time since I've been fortunate enough to cut some hair as the last time was about 7 months ago when a fwb asked me to do her hair and she got a short pixie with the side of her head buzzed. She loved it and keeps it cut that way to this day. \n\nOther than the fetish, I'm 5'9\", in good shape and work out on a regular basis, a gentleman at my core but definitely capable of a dominant role (and quite good at it) if the situation calls for it. I have an amazing ginger beard if you're into that sort of thing and my skills in bed are quite fantastic(or so I'm told) \n\nWhat I'd like from you is a willingness to have your hair cut; whether it's just a trim, a long to short (my favorite), or even a full head shave. Ideally you'd be down for things to get sexual afterwards as cutting hair really turns me on. If you're not interested in the sex, then that's more than ok, I can still do your hair for you. It's the summer time, it's hot outside, why not get rid of your long hair and try something different and exciting! \n\nYou'll get a complete makeover, additional cleanup and services at a salon (provided by me) if you're looking for something a bit outside of my abilities, new clothes to fit the cut if necessary, and the possibility of attending events (premieres, screenings, etc) with me so I can show you off. \n\nIf you're interested then message me with a picture and a little bit about yourself. I can then send you photos of past cuts I've done if you would like. We'll chat for a bit and meet up somewhere for coffee before hand, that way you're comfortable and know that this is all above board. \n\nTldr;I want to cut your hair, Make you look like a million bucks, then hopefully have a little fun.","permalink":"/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/2cafl0/25_m4f_los_angeles_i_want_to_cut_your_hair_and/","link_flair_text":null}

Sorry. Also I'm posting from my phone and mad, sorry for typos.)\n\n\nNmom is a caretaker/janitor in a building and when I decided to move out, I needed a place ASAP because my boyfriend was visiting from another state and nmom didn't want him to stay at her place (where I was living then). I had already decided to move out, but his visit was coming fast and I still didn't get a place. So nmom found a solution and offered me an apartment in the building where she works (also where she lives).\n\n\nShe did literally everything to slow down the process of me moving out of home. It's like she didn't want me to move out. She didn't go tell the landlords I was supposed to get in soon. Every time I asked her, she dismissed it or said she would ask tomorrow. \n\n\nI think her goal was to slow down the process until the end of my boyfriend's visit and during his visit, she would have been able to bully me for having him stay in HER apartment and fuck up the little time I had with him. \n\n\nWhen I visited the apartment she chose to show me, it was dirty, but she assured me it would get cleaned and fixed before I move in.\n\n\nI asked her only one thing: are there cockroaches in the apartment? She said no.\n\n\nI hate cockroaches. When I was in middle-school, nmom made us spend two years in a shitty apartment filled with them and it has taken a toll on me. I used to find them everywhere. In my shoes, in my milk, on my face when I woke up. So now, I would rather live with ants instead of cockroaches. I hate them so much I don't even know where to start.\n\n\nI asked her many times and she always said no, no cockroaches. It was okay for me.\n\n\nThe day of moving in came and the apartment was still dirty and my boyfriend, siblings and I had to clean, paint, etc. And we found a few dead cockroaches.\n\n\nI was mad because I knew what it meant.\nI found Baygon against cockroaches left by the previous person who was living here. And I was mad. When I asked nmom she said \"oh yeah they did have cockroaches. I knew it.\"\n\n\nI'm mad at her. She blatantly lied to me to get me to live close to her.\n\nI have seen two or three cockroaches. I bought stuff to repel them but I know they're almost immortal. It makes me mad. I should not have to do it. \n\nTomorrow I'm going to go apply for a new place in another neighborhood. I'm feeling annoyed because I only moved in three months ago and now I'm seeking to move out again because I don't have cockroaches yet but I know they might invade the apartment when winter comes and they need a warmer place.\n\nI'm so mad at her. Who does it? I'm 27. I'm not a child you lie to. I pay with my own goddamn money. I deserve to know the truth and choose as I want.

The summer before was spent at home with little to do, so I filled my time with food. It got worse and worse until the middle of my sophomore year. By then I was around 250 pounds. I maintained a similar body mass while growing a couple more inches. I didn't really care enough about it to do anything to fix it. I was content being fat and eating whatever I wanted. This attitude didn't change for a long time. That's all it was. I wasn't in denial, I didn't try to make excuses for the way I was. I just liked eating more than I hated being fat. I knew I was in complete control of myself and it was just a matter of when I would put my foot down.\n\n\nThat happened about six months ago, in early February. I had an encounter in December with someone who I hadn't seen in three months. He was excited to see me and told me I had lost weight. I didn't notice anything, and no one else ever said anything about it. I wasn't even trying to lose anything, and I'm not sure if I did or not, but he planted that feeling in my brain. Even though I hadn't done anything, it felt good to have someone be proud of me for losing weight. I still didn't change anything for two months, but this was the first push in the right direction. \n\nFinally two months later I was browsing this sub along with /r/progresspics and was inspired to change myself. I wanted to stop being fat that moment. I knew that wasn't possible so I vowed to do everything I could to get there as soon as possible. I downloaded MyFitnessPal that day and started counting calories. I'm 6'1\" and started at what I estimated was 250 pounds, so my calorie limit was very manageable. I think I was able to eat something like 2200 calories a day to lose two pounds a week. It was not hard for me. I don't know why, but I was rarely hungry, never binged in moments of weakness, and didn't even use cheat days. \n\nIt took a couple of months to notice some real progress, but once it started I was ecstatic. I don't think I noticed much of a change until I hit 225 or so. I started feeling the muscles in my arms a little bit more, and my pants were too loose to wear without a belt. This kept me going when it started getting a little harder to ignore my cravings. I started having more and more days where I'd exceed my calorie limit, and started slipping with MFP. My progress slowed when I hit the summer. I had just finished my freshman year at college and was back home where food was much more present. We had dining halls that were all you can eat, but it was easier to control myself there than it was at home. At school I'd eat during meals, maybe 2 a day. At home, if I ever got bored I'd get up and get a snack. There are always unhealthy snacks in my house, so I was afraid I'd be overcome and lose my progress. Luckily I stuck it out pretty well. I'm now three quarters of the way through the summer and my progress only slowed a bit. \n\nJust yesterday I weighed in at 199. This is the first time I'm under 200 pounds since 9th grade. I didn't even bother weighing myself throughout much of high school, but I'd guess my peak weight was pushing 280. I've made a ton of progress and I'm excited to finish out the summer strong. I'm hoping to get to 188 by the time classes start, that would put me at a BMI of 24.8 and no longer \"overweight\". I have about 30 pounds to go to reach my initial goal, but I'll play it by ear and see when I'm satisfied. I'll start lifting weights more when school starts (free gym).\n\nPictures of my progress [SHIRTLESS FAT GUY]: http://imgur.com/a/rIeNQ"}

The rubber banding, lag, distortion and delays result in either my toon's death or complete inability to finish a mission. My new Science Toon has been levelling on Doff missions alone - I have not been able to complete more than half of the regular storyline. It simply isn't possible.\n\n\n**THE POINT OF THIS THREAD** is to get the attention of someone, *anyone* at Cryptic who might take an interest and/or offer some assistance. I have submitted at least a dozen tickets - some less cogent than others, I will admit - and not a single one has been answered. None.\n\n\nI have played video games since I was 15. I am 29. In the fourteen years I have played never has a company so wilfully or negligently ignored a specific group of users such as this. It astounds me.\n\n\n**TL;DR** Mac users continue to be screwed. We are in the dark. Cryptic, if you are reading this, please acknowledge us. Anything. Something. One line in the next Tribble update to give us hope that normality will soon return. STORedditors, if any of you possess the skills required to examine this problem I ask that you please try. Anything. One user in the forums mentioned Wineskin 1.5.0; I have never heard of nor used this before, but if someone would explain it I would be willing to try.\n\n\n**Cryptic** - I cannot emphasise enough how disappointed I am. As a real-money paying and relatively new member of the STO community, I would presume your goal would be to keep me appeased. Happy. Playing. Spending. While I and my Macintosh cohorts may represent a measly 0.001% of the overall community - and let's face it, Macs are terrible for gaming - your failure to acknowledge these issues publicly is astonishing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Irishman.^TM","media":null,"name":"t3_2cahc3","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"id":"2cahc3","num_comments":14,"author_flair_css_class":"combo","over_18":false,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"dasoberirishman","stickied":false,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"created":1406855988,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rfq3","secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/2cahc3/ongoing_mac_issues_help/","edited":1406854291,"score":10,"quarantine":false}

It was friday, things were running fine yesterday, I had sorted through my job list and completely cleaned it out, backups were running fine, I had just finished cleaning out my DC's of old users, moving critical services over to service accounts as opposed to using the domain admin user, etc. Things were looking up and all I wanted to do was sit down and not put pressure on the huge wound on the bottom of my foot.\n\nHow naive of me. \n\nSo I just finished training up a local technician a couple of weeks ago. He's a young guy like me, early 20's, and is eager like I am. Just the basics really - Adding users, common printer issues, pointed him towards the wiki I built a while ago for common issues (fan-freaking-tastic idea by the way, thanks fellas) and figured he would be okay for a while, while I was at the doctors. I work in 4 different schools, and this one in particular is one of my primary schools, for context.\n\nAnyways. I rock up to work and the place has gone into emergency mode. Nothing is working. I'm 20 minutes late and everything was working yesterday - what the hell could have possibly happened? So I immediately approach the ICT manager. She's got no idea things are even not working as she's in the staffroom having her coffee and whatever pills she is on today. No luck there.\n\nI move towards the server room and find my new local (Who we'll call \"J-Willo\" for convenience sake). I ask J-Willo what's up and he immediately starts mumbling something about checking out server hardware. *Oh. Fuck.* He'd opened up the chassis and done god knows what to the hardware. Why, you ask? *Because I was just trying to figure out what it was capable of.* Hnnnnnnngh.\n\nAnyways, as I had already explained to poor J-Willo - The servers are under warranty, and opening up the box will probably void that warranty altogether. Tampering with the hardware most definitely. They are built to spec in shop and leased to us. We are most definitely fucked and will have to pay out the rest of the lease for a broken server.\n\nI don't know what he did exactly and I certainly don't know how he managed to do it in an hour, but now the stupid thing won't boot. It's obvious that the hardware has been damaged, what it is exactly I have yet to find out, I am calling IBM support before opening it again.\n\nI told him to go wait in my office and not to leave while I made sure the primary services had moved to the secondary host and restored VHD backups to it so things were back up and running at the very least.\n\nThe school is effectively running again which is good, users are getting on and doing what they need to do. Things are back up and I'm glad I didn't run into any issues restoring the VHD's. I generally have scripted WIM backups to two NAS units, and take VHD copies once at the end of the month (Literally yesterday. LUCKY.) which go on a drive that is stored in a fireproof safe.\n\nNow I'm sitting here in the server room, fuming, with my coffee, with a really, *really* sore foot, and am wondering what I'm going to do. It's now been 93 minutes since I started and I am already keen to leave and am definitely keen for a drink.\n\nThree things I have learned today:\n\n* I may be an alcoholic.\n\n* I need to fucking padlock my servers or something. What a bullshit thing. WHY WOULD YOU OPEN UP SERVERS THAT ARE IN PRODUCTION, WORKING FINE, AND TAMPER WITH THE HARDWARE?\n\n* I think this job is making me hate working with people. This is the second person I've trained now that has been a complete fucking flop despite the comprehensive documentation (Which I have slaved over) and weeks of shadowing me and learning the systems in place. Maybe I just suck at training people, but at some point I figured common sense would kick in.\n\nNow, to go and fire this idiot.\n\nHappy Friday!","permalink":"/r/sysadmin/comments/2cahw9/happy_friday/","link_flair_text":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Happy Friday!","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.sysadmin","subreddit":"sysadmin","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1406852764"}

I finally have an opportunity and now I'm sweating like crazy. I always was a little insecure because of being fat and that's the main reason why I never sought a relationship.

I have ZERO experience in dates and relationships. \n\nThis is a girl that I have known for a while that one day out of the blue told me that she liked me. We have been texting for a while and on Saturday I'm going out with her. Where should I take her? She obviously has experience and I'm too ashamed to tell her that I have never even kissed a girl. \n\nMy insecurities are getting the best of me making me believe that is gonna suck and that she will realize that she actually doesn't like.

Like I said, I was never around the guy and he didn't fuck me up. My mom has constantly belittled me and made me feel stupid, even though I study political science and many other things. \n\nAfter a little bit, we're yelling at each other, and I tell her the reason I'm fucked up is because of her and that she's so scary she even scares her mom. She tells me get the fuck out of her house and if not, she'll call the police. \n\nI leave and head to my grandparents. \n\nMy dad and grandparents basically said the same thing. She won't change and she's going to be miserable the rest of her life. But I am so tired of her knowing everything, and bullying everyone. I'm sure many of you know how it is to be belittled by your parents. It gets so tiring and she does the same thing to my younger sisters.\n\nI'm sorry if none of this made sense.

I have a job. I still live with my parents. I moved back in last summer after being gone for 3 years. I have a doggy savings account and a Care Credit card that is paid off at this point.\n\nDog A: One I've had for almost two years now. He's 8. \n\nWhen I got him from the pound, he has severe SA, would throw up multiple times a day from stress, and was blind.\n\nWell, it took my almost a year to train him and work with him. The separation anxiety is almost gone, no more puke, and I had cataract surgery done in one eye (2,000 dollars).\n\nTruthfully, I do spend a little more time with him. But here's why:\n\nDog B: The other dog I've had since I was younger. She's 13 now.\n\nShe had to have both eyes removed about 5 years ago. She adjusted very well.\n\nUntil about a year ago when she started freaking out. First she was scared of downstairs, then upstairs, then she would just whine all day. She always had to be ON TOP of someone. If not, sh'd whine and bark for HOURS. I, alone, took her to the vet multiple times. Paid 100's of dollars in vet bills. Eventually, she was put on something to make her calm down about six months ago.\n\n\nShe has calmed down a lot since on the pill, but she still has a little whining and barking issue. She is going deaf now.\n\nWell, I worked all summer. Getting up at 6 AM and getting home at 6 PM. My mom is a teacher and didn't have to work. My dad got hurt and is right now on leave from work since June. \n\nThey do have to take her out during the day when I'm not there (but we have four dogs all together).\n\nNow, she wakes up early in the morning, every morning. As in 3 AM.\n\nI put her off my bed and she walks down to my parents room. \n\nShe is a long haired dog. I pay for her grooming and take her to/from there. \n\nShe gets hot in my room. My room is hotter than the whole house because it's above the garage. During the summer, it gets just about as hot as it does outside in my room WITH fans on. So, she goes to my parents freezing cold room.\n\nApparently, my mom gets up and gives her water every time she goes in there. I have NEVER known that. Also, there is food/water in my room for her and downstairs.  She takes her downstairs. \n\n\nWell, apparently since I'm not the one taking her to get water (that I truthfully didn't know she needed or wanted as she has always gotten it herself in my room in the past), I don't take care of her.\n\nI pay for both of my dogs. Their vet bills, grooming bills, for everything they need. I take them out if I'm there, I play with them. We do take turns giving her meds.\n\n\nI take care of her. Just DURING THE SUMMER WHEN IT'S HOT AND I KEEP HER CUT AS SHORT AS I CAN, they have been \"seeing her more\" at night or taking care of her because they're at home when I'm not. \n\n\nNow, why do I spend more time with Dog A?\n\nWell, Dog B freaks out anytime we go anywhere. She doesn't do well on car rides anymore. \n\nIf I stay the night at my boyfriends, she can't come. It's a new place with a two year old Jack Russell who is insane. To me, it's cruel to take her there, make her adjust to new surroundings with a new dog, just to take her back home for a longer period of time than I would be there. It would be very confusing to her. Now, if I moved in with him, she would come with me.\n\n\nI \"hang out\" with Dog A more because he is able to do more. While Dog B would RATHER be asleep on the couch, I take the other dog out.\n\nDog B will also bark when she gets tired of being with someone. She rotates throughout the house throughout the day by her own choice. My parents get do get tired of her barking to go somewhere else, but they can't just put her down downstairs and expect her to go upstairs anymore to me. She just doesn't do that anymore. Though, they don't want to take her upstairs either. So I also don't take care of her when she's barking downstairs because I don't go to get her every time. I mean, they're both perfectly capable of carrying her up the stairs too. Yes, she's my dog. But I'm busy sometimes and can't always drop everything, just like they are sometimes when I come get her.\n\n\n\nI don't think it's fair to say that I don't take care of my dog when I do.\n\nYes, while they're both home they probably are taking care of her more often. But what am I supposed to do? I'm having to give them money right now because they're not paying my dad while he's out of work. \n\n\nI take care of both of my dogs. I love both of my dogs.\n\nThis past year has been a struggle with Dog B for all of us. \n\nShe whines and barks and we ALL can't always figure out what she wants sometimes. She goes to the vet regularly (as in every other month basically at this point) and it's just her getting older. \n\nIt is frustrating to listen to her bark. That was my dad's complaint. Does her not think that we all don't hear it? Does he not seeing us all trying to figure out what she wants? \n\nShe still has time left and we're having to make her comfortable in her old age. I think she deserves that.\n\nEspecially since it was my mom's dog who attacked her and caused her to be blind in the first place. -_- But we've taken care of that and what's done is done.","media":null,"domain":"self.offmychest","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1406854201","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"offmychest","title":"My mom just told me that I don't take care of my dog.","secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2cak13/my_mom_just_told_me_that_i_dont_take_care_of_my/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","created":1406857801,"from_kind":null,"edited":false,"score":2,"quarantine":false,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_2cak13","link_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"id":"2cak13","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":2,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"TheNewStuff"}

{"selftext":"Hi, I'm 21, female and been coping with (diagnosed) depression for almost a year. I was diagnosed after a suicide attemp last year. My family has been nothing but supportive about my illness, I've been taking my meds religiously and my doctor is amazing, I think, I really love him. My whole life has changed upside down after my attemp. I was at a shitty mental hospital (there are few in my country, and honestly fewer are covered by insurance) for a month which left me with mild ptsd according to my doctor, and I agree (It was an horrifying experience - with nurses tying down patients and a punishment room). Anyway, after being released I moved back to my hometown with my parents(I was living alone with my sister while in college) switched to a better uni than I was before (which is great actually) in medicine (oh, the irony). Even if I still felt raw and lonely and had this feeling on the pit of my stomach, I really thought I was getting better, I adapted pretty well to my new life and the meds and the new people. I mean, I didn't skip class and sleep in, I actually DID things and laughed and everything. But after the semester ended I started being lax in my meds and self care because I was too full of myself. The feeling of dread that was small started growing back. My hometown friends weren't available and without school I didn't know what to do, and I spent my hours sleeping and feeling blue. I got involved with this guy and he dumped me last night a few hours later we had what I thought was this AMAZING date. That was what tipped me over the scale. I've had an awful dating record, never had a boyfriend or a succesful date. It makes me even sadder to see how fragile my mental health is. I mean, I was making leaps and bounds towards my recovery...now I feel like I'm in square one again. Today I just stayed home crying and sleeping, like I did before.\nI apologize in advance for my mistakes, english is not my first language.","media":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1441241191,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/depression/comments/2cakd0/i_honestly_thought_i_was_recovering/","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"I honestly thought I was recovering.","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1406854416","subreddit":"depression","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.depression","edited":false,"score":1,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"created":1406858016,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qqqf","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2cakd0/i_honestly_thought_i_was_recovering/","secure_media":null,"stickied":false,"from":null,"author":"throoowaway67","is_self":true,"num_comments":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2cakd0","id":"2cakd0","archived":true}

I'm 26 years old, have been playing for 12 years. I've been in a few bands throughout the years, but ever since graduating college and getting a full time job, i've mostly become a bedroom player.\n\nThe majority of what i play is 60's-80's classic rock/heavy metal, and also blues. The more I play and practice this type of music, i start to get these thoughts where i ask myself why am i doing this if no one really cares, and this type of music isn't really liked or popular anymore? These past couple of weeks i've been trying to learn the entire Van Halen 1 album. Why? I really have no idea. I don't really know what my end goal is other than to increase my guitar technique. But then once i do that, then what? What was the point of all the work? This is something i'm still trying to find the answer to.\n\nWhen I was in high school, and early college, music was everything. All I thought about was music and guitar, and was surrounded by musicians. I was going to major in music. A combination of persuasion and me not being accepted to a local universities music program made me re-evaluate if being a music major was the right decision. Ultimately I decided to major in computer science.\n\nSo here I am now, with a full time job as a software developer. I spend 8 hours a day, 5 days a week staring at computer code. I come home and play my rock/metal riffs and solos in private, or sometimes don't even feel like playing. I ask myself why I continue to do it if there seems to be no goal or nothing i'm working towards. \n\nI'll admit that in high school a lot of my motivation was to become the best guitarist at the school and impress my friends, girls, etc. After high school the motivation matured a bit, but it still had roots in being recognized in some way for the work i put in.\n\nI am no longer surrounded by musicians. Most of them have either moved away, or have stopped playing. At work, when the subject of music and guitar comes up, and I start talking about it, everyone's eyes glaze over and they look like a deer in headlights because i tend to turn into a guitar/music geek. Sort of depresses me in a way, and is almost like a culture shock. Being around musicians and people who share your interest for so long makes things very weird when all of a sudden the people you are with don't understand what you are talking about.\n\nLately, i've been sitting in on meetings at work, and while everyone pretends to be so happy that the company is making money and getting new clients, i am sitting there thinking \"I don't really care about your company, or your products, or how much money you are making. I am only here and pretending to care because I am getting a paycheck. How i wish this was some awesome recording session or something else music/guitar related.\" Even then I stop myself and realize how this is my life now, and it seems like guitar will always just be a simple hobby.\n\nI don't seem to have goal to work towards, and no answer as to why I'm doing the things i'm doing. (working on VH1 songs, etc). No clear answer as to what I hope to accomplish with guitar/music. Also, I guess another problem is that i spent years of hard work to be able to play the way I play, maybe even sacrificing some social elements in my teenage years, but I have nothing to show for it.\n\nAnyone ever have similar thoughts? Ultimately leading you to ask yourself why you play guitar/music? Like I said, for myself, I still don't really have a clear answer.","retrieved_on":1441241191,"ups":25,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":38,"id":"2cakel","archived":true,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2cakel","author":"RetroByte","from":null,"is_self":true,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/2cakel/ever_ask_yourself_why_you_play_guitarmusic/","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi79","created":1406858056,"from_kind":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"score":25,"edited":false}

Quite a bit, actually, although it's normally passive. I have bumped into someone, and have them exclaim, \"OW! You just stabbed me with your bone!\" When I was 12, I wore thermal tights to my soccer game. I got laughed at and told I have chicken legs. By the coach. At work, someone commented on the fact that I am \"like a ninja\" (because I walk quietly and quickly). Someone else said, \"yeah, 'cause like, if he turns sideways, he's 2D!\"\n\nFat activists will normally say that thin privilege is being able to find your size clothes in a mall. However, I dare you to try and find a size 28\"W x 34\"H in men's pants at any standard clothing store.

The shirt that I have to wear for work is a medium, because the small was so short that I wasn't able to keep it tucked.

In much the same way that I, as a non-smoker, have privilege over smokers. I don't have to inconvenience myself, I am seen as more attractive, and I am not slowly killing myself. \n\nMy mom is a fitness instructor, so I grew up around eating well and working out. To continue the smoking analogy, I did not grow up around \"smokers,\" so I have a disposition towards the healthier lifestyle. People who did grow up in that environment will find it harder not to \"smoke.\" But that does not make it healthy, and anyone who believes it does is absolutely kidding themselves.\n\n**tl;dr** Thin privilege is not all it's cracked up to be.

I started my college career as an engineering undecided major and spent the first year doing general basic engineering courses and math. I ended up getting a C in physics but A's and B's in everything else. During that summer, I got really sick and ended up staying home and going to community college instead. At this point I was not sure in my decision to continue being an engineering major. I continued with my math classes but also experimented a little bit with other courses.\n\n* To make a long story short (or at least try to), I changed majors a couple times, and now im back where I started. I got a C- in Calc 2, and a D in Calc 3. My mom thinks that I should take Calc 3 over and try and push through with engineering. I don't particularly enjoy math, especially calculus, but I think I might enjoy engineering, it's hard to say. I hear people say all the time that once you get past the basic math and physics requirements, that it gets easier. Is there any truth to this?\n\n* Is it a good choice to continue pushing forward even though I feel somewhat hopeless about it? I am worried that I will take forever struggling with engineering if I continue, but at the same time I have already taken a lot of required math courses and I don't want to waste them. If I switch majors I'll also have to start over from scratch. Not to mention I don't even know what major I would want to switch into at this point! I am so confused and I do not know where to go from here.\n\n* I hope I'm in the right subreddit for this, has anyone else ever been in this situation? Should I even still be considering engineering if I pulled a D in calc 3? I am 22 years old now and I really need to finish up a degree.

My response to \"don't overthink it\" or \"follow your gut\" might be something like \"hey so your pussy looks super tight, want to come over so we can both loosen up a bit?\"  As in, short of inviting a girl over, I just have zero ideas.\n\nThe second response tends to be \"just grab drinks\".

In order for me to feel confident in setting the time and place, I need some practical knowledge on what time and place will be optimal, and so I turn to you, my RP brothers.\n\nI understand that the optimal location is highly situational.

But until then, I'd really love to hear where you guys meet up with a girl the *first* time.  Coming in from a previous interaction, it's easy to build off shared experience, but coming in cold...

I'm leaving for graduate school in about a week, and I've been getting a bunch of paperwork and stuff taken care of before I move. I just filled out a medical power of attorney today, and I would HIGHLY recommend everyone here (and everywhere else, for that matter) has one filled out.\n\nIt's very important to have one these filled out, in case you are ever in an emergency or an accident, and you're ever unable to communicate to doctors or nurses.\n\nYou can appoint an agent to act on your behalf and make decisions according to their assessment of your values. **It does NOT have to be a family member**, if you don't want it to be. You can make notes of whether or not you are interested in organ donation, donating your body to science, if you want to be kept alive or you don't want to be resuscitated, etc. Also, an important thing for this subreddit is that **you can provide rules and instructions for your visitation**. If you have an N-family member, and you don't want them to be present for visits or involved with decisions about your life, then write that down in the document, and they will honor it.\n\nMy mom is an ICU nurse, and she has been doing that job for longer than I've been alive. She's told me countless sad stories of patients that are sick like that, and the families come in and argue and bicker about what to do, and it's just an unpleasant experience for everyone. It's a shame that families have to act like that in front of dying relatives, but it happens. And all of that can be avoided by filling out one of these forms.\n\nI'm not a lawyer or anything, but it's my understanding that it's common practice for both parents to be notified about an emergency, and if they can't be located, then they'll look for siblings, kids, aunts/uncles, etc. If there are people that fall into any of these categories, and you decide you don't want them involved, then make it known in that document. If you don't have it filled out, then it is up to the state to decide what to do about your body, your end-of-life care, and your visitors. And it is highly unlikely that they will consider anything about N-behavior amongst family members.\n\nIn Virginia, it's called an [advance healthcare directive](http://www.vsb.org/sections/hl/2012_VA_AMD_Simplifed-Basic.PDF), which is essentially the same thing as a power of attorney. Can't speak for other states, but in Virginia, this document does not need to be notarized or written by a lawyer. You just have to have two witnesses observe you signing it. [This link](http://www.nhdd.org/state-specific-resources/) provides links for each individual state's \ndocuments about this.\n\nMy advice would be to keep one copy for yourself, give one to the person(s) you appoint as your agent, and give one copy to your doctor's office, so they can keep it with your medical records.\n\nAgain, I can't stress this enough, it is important for *everyone* to have one of these filled out, so that your voice can be heard, even when you are unable to speak. This is how you make that happen. It takes a few minutes to fill out, it's free (or very inexpensive), no lawyers are needed, and you can specify any directions about your body, your moral values, your treatments, and even your visitors. Please fill one of these out. It could save you a LOT of trouble and drama down the road, if you are ever in an accident or something. Please be prepared, because I would hate to see some bad N-behavior come forward during a time of medical emergency like this. And it happens more often than you might believe. Please prevent that for yourself, and fill out one of these documents.\n\nI will close with [another link](http://www.nhdd.org/public-resources/) that provides more information and resources about this kind of stuff. It is a very helpful website, and they're the founders of National Healthcare Decisions Day, which is an initiative that is designed to get people to think about this stuff and make their decisions and voices known. The main reason I keep linking to this site, is because my mom knows the lawyer that founded this organization, and it is a noble and very important cause.\n\n**tl;dr - Please fill out a medical power of attorney, and appoint a trusted family member or friend to act on your behalf, in case of a medical emergency where you are unable to communicate. Keep one for yourself, and give one to your agent and one to your doctor. If you don't want your N-relatives involved with making decisions about your life and your body, or even if you don't want them present during visitation, then write it down in the document. It will be honored, and your voice will be heard. It only takes a few minutes, it's extremely low-cost, and does not require lawyers or knowledge of legal jargon. You never know when you might need this form, and it could really save you a lot of drama later on down the road.**\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold, I really appreciate it! And I'm so glad to see interest in this, it is an important topic to think about. Before I start replying to all the comments, [I wanted to link to another comment in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2caovp/psa_please_make_sure_you_have_filled_out_a/cjdz9zk) that has some additional important information that I did not remember to include in my post. You can revoke your document at any time, if you ever change your mind about anything. And it only goes into effect if a medical professional declares you mentally incapacitated, according to generally accepted healthcare practices. Please read that comment that /u/InbredNoBanjo posted with more information about that.","media":null,"ups":175,"retrieved_on":1441241133,"num_comments":61,"author_flair_css_class":"","saved":false,"over_18":false,"link_flair_css_class":"","gilded":1,"name":"t3_2caovp","id":"2caovp","archived":true,"from":null,"author":"mulch17","is_self":true,"from_id":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2caovp/psa_please_make_sure_you_have_filled_out_a/","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","created":1406861074,"from_kind":null,"stickied":false,"score":175,"edited":1406910496,"quarantine":false}

I'm 27 and I'm studying to be a therapist for young adults and teens. I currently work at a live-in facility for adults with special needs. I've been here about six years now and I seem to have stumbled across a bit of a problem.\n\nWe have a resident who came to us last year, she settled in quickly but it was clear to most of the other staff that she did not belong here. She was classified as having special needs but even our supervisor has acknowledged that she's probably more capable of handling herself in the real world than anybody in the building, staff included.\n\nThe family is very uninvolved except for the mother who is *very* involved and we've been able to piece together that basically the family's problem is the girl doesn't act the way she did when she was younger and doesn't want to follow the family's dictates about what to do with the rest of her life. She's an artist, she loves creating, but the family doesn't think that's a good choice for her and keeps pushing her to do something more practical. They figure she's 23, it's time to go to college for a degree.\n\nOur facility has kind of become a holding tank for her and despite the fact that most of us can agree she's not suited for us or any other program we know, we can't send her home. Our board of directors aren't fond of doing that because it means we have to refund contract money (so I've been told) and they're happy to have another bed filled with someone who doesn't overtly cause problems.\n\nMy issue started manifesting with this girl a few months after she got here. I started talking to her, just trying to sort out what we could do to make the best of the situation if her family wouldn't yank her and the board won't pull her. Over the last few months we've actually grown somewhat of a connection between us and I'm finding I'm actually starting to really be drawn to her as a person. Yes, she's physically attractive and I'm not going to lie, that is part of it. But in all honesty she is someone that, had we met outside of these circumstances, I'd have been drawn to personally as well as physically.\n\nFrom what I've been able to discern, she's starting to feel the same way. We both share very similar views on life, we have very similar experiences, our tastes are similar, and we both mesh very well. I remember back through class learning about personal countertransferrence and the various ethics classes but...it seems so far removed from the reality of the situation. I realize I'm technically in a position of power over her and that plays into it but I feel like that can be compensated for if we're both aware of it.\n\nI'm just...very stuck.

I would puke before every session. It also cut into my ability to hang out with friends and stuff\n\nSports: I sucked at hitting in baseball. I progressively got better, and although the number of hits I'd get in a single season would increase, they were still in the single digits. Me at the time told myself I sucked, so I quit. I also played lacrosse, but my glasses/sports goggles did not fit under my helmet, so I played without the ability to see. I also never practiced, and I got cut from the freshman lacrosse team. I cried my eyes out that night and just gave up afterward. \n\nMusic: I've been playing guitar on and off, but i would not say I am good by any means. I am pretty sloppy because I tried playing too fast in the beginning. I do practice unclean vocals, but even then, I'm not sure if I am \"good\" yet. \n\nFriends: Back in middle school, my good friend was trying to make more friends, and I was alone. I figured I should do the same, and I ended up trying to become friends with the popular kids. I thought they liked me, but they were really just laughing at me behind my back. I became so afraid of getting out of my shell to become better friends with acquaintances because I fear they would just find me annoying/not giving them enough space. I have some good friends now at school, but even they are branching out. \n\nBeing at school and coming back has made me realize how much I have truly screwed up and brought onto myself. Now that I realize the problem, I just need support getting out of the hole I dug myself into.\n\nAlso, family: Parents fought a lot, parenting styles of both were WAY different, they got divorced, not sure if dad despises me because of my actions caused by my flaws\n\nThe icing on the cake which truly made me realize my flaws have caught up to me was when I was pulled over and a cop searched my car (because I sorta suck at handling stressful situations like that). They found some bud and a piece, confiscated it, and here I am now trying to get the charges off my record by going through programs. \n\n1) To anyone who has been in a situation similar to mine, how did you fix it? What was the icing on your cake?\n2) How did you get out of your comfort zone and finally feel comfortable in your own skin? \n3) To those of you who have found a passion/hobby, how did you get through the initial frustration of sucking?\n\n(I am slowly making progress, but never have I tried to reach out)","media":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1441241100,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/offmychest/comments/2carew/i_am_19_and_i_have_no_talents_am_insecure_because/","downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"I am 19 and i have no talents/ am insecure because of my laziness and my choice to not leave my comfort zone, which in turn has made me more and more depressed over time","secure_media_embed":{},"created_utc":"1406859092","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"offmychest","domain":"self.offmychest","hide_score":false}

I've never gotten into a career that really fits me (my own fault), and I've worked like a dog in jobs which I loved, but which also tear me apart. I'm always frantic, yet calm, full of joy and despair. I thought I was bi-polar with social anxiety because I went through high-school while living outside of any community.\n\nBut now I'm 31 and I keep repeating the same cycles, constant inability to socialize casually, constant obsessions with projects, art, science, numbers, tapping, drumming, counting, making things. I can have conversations and I have a sense of humour, but then I need to get the hell out. I can't stand living with people and I hate any noises in my house. I always end up quitting jobs after a complete and total social breakdown.\n\nI thought I had pathological emotional problems, but I just have ridiculous expectations for myself which consistently cause stress. It's frustrating to know that I haven't been putting my best foot forward. I expect myself to \"learn\" to become socially \"normal,\" but the truth is that I'm pretty sure I'm deep into Asperger's territory. I've thought this before, but I always disregarded it as a cop-out. I still have to pay rent, so what would it do to think of myself like this?\n\nNow I'm living with my mom and my brother, and I won't get into details but I'm broke, owe a lot of money because of my most recent breakdown (where I lost friends!), and now I have a new job while living with Mom and my bro, but it's an uncomfortable and distracting, nerve-wracking living situation (Mom works from home and my bro does not work... so someone is ALWAYS home, and we have two dogs and three cats lololol). It will be a couple more months before I have the cash to move out and I just need to keep it together until then.\n\nI went to a GP who referred me to a social worker, who referred me to a psychiatrist, who sent me to a psychologist for an extensive test. He seemed delighted to talk to me and told me I have a high IQ (though he might have been buttering me up) and gave me a little advice for dealing with women (no point hitting on them at the bars, etcetera). He's going to send a report to the psychiatrist, and I'll have another meeting with them, hopefully soon.\n\nSince then I've mostly been just re-thinking all the things that I screwed up... not because I'm dumb but because I forced myself through the wrongs processes! My life has been beautiful, but fucking hard! I also find I've been repressing a lot of my \"aspie\" instincts and behaviours. It's silly to care about the diagnosis, since it won't achieve anything practical, but I want to hear it from a professional.\n\nSo now I'm just letting myself \"do my thing\" and adjust to *what I've known all along.* This could all be very good, but first I've got to get through these two months!!

For me, it feel like this date is too good to be true, and I fear theres something strange about this.\n\nFor one, she asked me for MY number in her second messege. Usually it takes like 10 back and forth for me to get the balls to ask. She was pretty enthusiastic about it, like \"Hey I love x you know :) You should text me! Do you text?\". \n\nSecond red flag: Shes attractive, or at least I assume she is because she has a pretty face and says shes into the gym and healthy eating in her profile. I know this sounds like me being a little bitch, but attractive girls NEVER respond to my messeges, I usually have to stick in the realm of overweight girls. I'm in good shape myself but my face is fucked from acme scars and I look like I'm 14 according to customers at work.(I'm 19) I just have a hard time believing that such a girl is reaching way down. I'm reallly confident about my personality and communication skills, but I doubt that they could single handedly get an attractive girl\n\nShes also really interested in me. Most of my messeges, even the ones that reach text, are essentially quesitonaires for the girls, they rarely take too much of an interest in me, but shes asking me unsolicited questions and actually wants to get to know me. When I finnally asked her out, she was really happy about it, like \"YEAH! I'd love to :) I'm free Saturday, you?\"kind of thing. The fact that she said saturday, a day thats usually reserved for other, more attractive guys that shes probobly talking to, makes me really think that theres something fishy going on.

{"media":null,"selftext":"Alright so I know there are a lot of women who are curious about IUDs and while I was doing research on getting one I felt that there could never be enough info and perspectives for me to take into consideration. \n\nA little background info; I am 21 years old and I have never ever been pregnant. I have been on birth control since I was 16 and have tried several different kinds. Hormones mess with my body big time. The only BC that worked for me was a pill that was very high in estrogen which resulted in severe pms or pmdd symptoms. One week a month I started to become very depressed to the point that I felt like ending my life. But that week would pass and I'd be perfectly happy again. It was like a light switch. Finally I said enough is enough and I decided I wanted the non-hormonal copper IUD. My doc was thrilled at the idea even though I've never had kids. She, and the nurse practitioner that did the procedure, do it every day on women who have never been pregnant. \n\nThe procedure itself was very fast. I was not on my period but she used some kind of dilation cream on my cervix. She also used a numbing cream so I didn't feel the actual insertion at all. However it was VERY painful. If your uterus has never had anything in it before, it does not take kindly to your IUD and tries very hard to get it out. So all of the pain I felt was from contractions. It was very very painful for the first 2 days but I still feel it will be totally worth it. \n\nI am now 4 days out. Day three I had mild cramping and general discomfort and today I have a few random cramps here and there that pass quickly. Some people finish their BC cycle to minimize spotting but I chose to stop my pills immediately so I am currently on my period. I go back in 2 weeks to get an ultra sound to make sure my uterus didn't succeed in pushing it out. \n\nIf you have any questions for me I'd love to answer them! \n\nI was wondering if any of you girls still use a menstrual cup?

I'm late posting. I have many stories. This was one of my favorites.\n\nThe store I work at, where everything is generally a dollar in price,  closes at 10 pm- on the dot- no exceptions. \nOne night, it's 9:57 and I am standing at the door waiting to turn the lock as a **very** drunk man saunters in. He goes aisle to asile, mumbling himself. I don't pay him much mind and wait behind my register for him to come up so I can finish closing duties and go home. He eventually settles on a 4 pack of beer. At my store, it Is company policy to ID every single person who attempts to buy alcohol or tobacco products, every single time they come in. It's an annoying rule (almost all of my customers are regulars who don't like doing it every time they come in).  The following is our conversation- he will be known as DM for drunk man:\n\nLarry: Hello sir. How are you tonight? \n\nDM: I'm doing *mumblemumblemumble*\n\nLarry: well that's good to hear. May I see a picture ID for the alcohol?\n\nDM: Why would you need that? I'm 43 years old. Just give me the beer man.\n\nLarry: I'm sorry sir. I can't sell this alcohol without a picture ID, as it is company policy. If you could go outside to your car and give me an ID I am more than welcome to waiting. (**NOTE**: I thought about just locking him out at this point. He smelled horrible and had an attitude-ish tone. We were closed as of 7 minutes ago and I wanted to go home)\n\nHe agrees and I accompany him to the door so I can stand watch and wait for him to bring me his ID. His friends get out of the car and ask what the problem was. After I explained, DM was sitting in the car. I craned my neck out of the door and asked if he had found his ID.\n\nDM: what ID? What are you talking about?  Just give me my beer!\n\nLarry: I'm sorry sir. You have not purchased it yet, I need your picture ID, and frankly we have closed 10 minutes ago. I need to finish my duties for the night and go home. Are you bringing me your ID?\n\nhis friends chime in and ask if they could just give me their birthday. \n\nLarry: no. I'm sorry. I need to show the 4 cameras that I am looking at a valid picture ID. It's company policy. I could get fired if I do not look at one.  None of them have an ID on them....and they drove here. *sigh*\nOne friend finally asks,  \"could we go home and get it? We live 5 minutes away.\"\n\n**wat**.\n\nLarry: I'm sorry, no. We're closed. I cannot let anyone else inside of my store. I have to go home. It is now 10:15. I am late finishing up my duties. Have a good night.\n\nAnd with that I locked the doors and started mopping.
