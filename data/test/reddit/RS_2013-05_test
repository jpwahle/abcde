I had just broken up with my first real life and she kind of came into my life a week after we broke up. Problem: she had a boyfriend of 4 years. I didn&amp;#39;t care much because I was very much into her (yes, you may hate me for this), and she made it clear that they were having problems and she was having serious doubts. This went on for about 3 months. During this time we slept together, had sex, the whole 9 yards. We connected, and she was the polar opposite of my ex-gf, something I really needed. During this time I told her she should take her time thinking about what she wanted with her bf etc. I tried as much as possible not pushing her into breaking up. I wanted her to break up with him, of course, but because she felt like it, not because I pushed her or forced a decision.  She thought I was too sweet for her, and thought I was crazy giving her 3 months to do so. Maybe so, but I really like this girl, so what can you do..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a month ago she broke up with her bf. I was over the moon. We had been dating in secret for such a long time, now we could finally start dating out in the open and do more things together etc. Or so I thought. We decided to not immediately make things official, since she just got out of a relationship, but we started dating &amp;#39;exclusive&amp;#39;. We saw each other 1/2x a week, everything went well. We talked a lot, I wanted to make sure she was ready for this etc. Tried being understanding about her being single for a while, but I told her I&amp;#39;d waited for 3 months, so there was no way I was gonna let her run wild now. She agreed, and told me she was fine with this and understood me perfectly. We had conversations about this every other week mostly, just because I was trying to make sure she felt we were doing the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, due to circumstances we didn&amp;#39;t see each other 3 weeks. She was ill, went on holiday with her parents, etc. Before she left I felt a little distance, we talked about it: she said she thought we might be moving a little fast for her liking. She didn&amp;#39;t know for sure if she was ready for a new relationship so fast etc. She said however she was more then willing to keep this going, and had no intention of ending our &amp;#39;exclusive&amp;#39; dating situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She came back from her holiday, and we agreed to see each other this friday. However yesterday I get a text from her that she kissed another guy while drunk. She also told me she wasn&amp;#39;t ready for an exclusive commitment and wanted to be single for a while. I was devastated, devastated being an understatement. I just couldn&amp;#39;t understand why, what went wrong, why she didn&amp;#39;t tell me earlier, etc. I asked her if she wanted to end things, and at that moment she said yes. I told her we should meet up and discuss this in person to make a final decision. *&lt;em&gt;NOTE: she texted me because she was afraid some1 had seen her. She was planning on telling me in person this friday, but was afraid some1 would tell me before, which she wanted to avoid. *&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was heartbroken. We decided to meet up today. She came to my place, and we talked. A LOT. She said she felt terrible, like she cheated on me, she said she was very sorry etc. I told her how devasted I was, etc. Eventually I suggested we should keep on seeing eachother, but that we could also hook up with others. We agreed that we weren&amp;#39;t ready to break things up because we still really like eachother. She was hesitant at first, but then fully agreed. She said she was afraid we were gonna hurt eachother with this arrangement, which I partially agreed on. But as said, we weren&amp;#39;t/aren&amp;#39;t ready to let go. We would try this for a while, and then see where we would be at, dating/relationwise. She told me this might just be somethign which she needed to get out of her system etc., and that she would probably feel really fucking crappy if I told her I hooked up with someone else.

Some say: dump this bitch, find someone who is totally committed to you/fuck this bullshit, you probably cannot trust her. The others say: we think she likes you, but we understand her side, she just got out, might feel a bit trapped, and maybe this is what she needs to realise just how much she really likes you. I&amp;#39;m in the middle. I want to trust her, we&amp;#39;ve been honest about everything towards eachother and I want to give her space. On the other hand, they might be right: shouldn&amp;#39;t I just end things because she might just be stringing me along?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need some advise: people who have experienced something along these lines, general advice: is this going somewhere or is this just the beginning of the end?

I had just broken up with my first real life and she kind of came into my life a week after we broke up. Problem: she had a boyfriend of 4 years. I didn't care much because I was very much into her (yes, you may hate me for this), and she made it clear that they were having problems and she was having serious doubts. This went on for about 3 months. During this time we slept together, had sex, the whole 9 yards. We connected, and she was the polar opposite of my ex-gf, something I really needed. During this time I told her she should take her time thinking about what she wanted with her bf etc. I tried as much as possible not pushing her into breaking up. I wanted her to break up with him, of course, but because she felt like it, not because I pushed her or forced a decision.  She thought I was too sweet for her, and thought I was crazy giving her 3 months to do so. Maybe so, but I really like this girl, so what can you do..\n\nAbout a month ago she broke up with her bf.

I kind of stumbled upon her and her friend gossiping. I joke with her and her friend ends up leaving. It&amp;#39;s just me and her laying on the bed chatting about our interests. We get to making out and everything about it feels right. My friend and I decide we should get going so we exchange numbers. She works 7a-7p so we exchange texts once or twice throughout the day and when she gets off work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can tell she&amp;#39;s really interested in me and I propose the first date. We meet up for lunch, grab an afternoon coffee and walk through one of my favorite bookstores. She tells me she had a really good time and I kiss her goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second date, I wanted to do something simple and catch a movie. We get through the movie, grabbed some food after and we end up in the back seat of my car. Things get a little hot and heavy (making out, caressing, no sex). I can tell she&amp;#39;s really into it and it got me really into it. We got into my back seat around 1130p and it&amp;#39;s now 130a. She tells me she&amp;#39;s gotta get going and that she had a really good time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the next several days, I&amp;#39;m thinking everything&amp;#39;s fine. We had a good time, we go about our weekend. Her texts are more and more distant. She&amp;#39;s telling me her phone had died so she had a hard time getting back to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clue #1, we both have iphones, all of my text messages were &amp;quot;delivered&amp;quot;, not &amp;quot;sent as text messages&amp;quot; as it would be if data couldn&amp;#39;t get through (i.e. a dead phone). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clue #2, I suggest we get together again since I was holding onto her earrings that fell off while we were in the back seat. I know she&amp;#39;s already reluctant by her general non-interest. All her texts are pretty much all business. I knew as much as she didn&amp;#39;t want to see me again, I didn&amp;#39;t want to hold on to her earrings either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clue #3, when we meet up for the third time, we don&amp;#39;t&amp;#39; meet up for long. She had family over, which I understand. We walk around another bookstore and normally we would hold hands or walk arm-in-arm but she wasn&amp;#39;t really interested, never looked for my hand if we walked off. When she had to go, the first thing and only thing she asked about was &amp;quot;Hey, before I forget, do you have my earrings?&amp;quot; which made me think... &amp;quot;yup... only here to get her earrings back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Couple days later, I&amp;#39;m talking to my friend, trying to give her the benefit of the doubt that she&amp;#39;s just been busy. But I had a hard time tricking myself into thinking she was still interested. My friend, the one who was with me when I first met her, kept saying things like, &amp;quot;Man, she&amp;#39;s probably just really busy. You should just leave her messages showin you&amp;#39;re still here.&amp;quot; Or &amp;quot;We should stop by her workplace on our way to grab drinks and just drop her off coffee and her favorite candy or something just to show her you&amp;#39;re thinking of her.&amp;quot; We never even made it that far. I stopped texting her, stopped calling her. I didn&amp;#39;t get it but I knew it was done. I didn&amp;#39;t get it because she told me &amp;quot;it was one of the best first dates I&amp;#39;ve ever had&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m really excited to see you&amp;quot; before the second date. I&amp;#39;d never seen someone&amp;#39;s interest drop so suddenly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SECOND INSTANCE&lt;/strong&gt;\n(This one&amp;#39;s a little more understandable to me)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago, I was talking to someone I had met during a snowboarding trip. I hadn&amp;#39;t really been talking to her much as I never really saw her too often. I was working in a rehab center and as I was walking out of the elevator, she stopped me. I didn&amp;#39;t even recognize her but she recognized me. I gave her a hug and we went our ways. Couple days later, she facebook messages me that she liked one of my status updates, &amp;quot;relationships with an Asian gentleman and a white woman. their little boy looks fucking adorable. #lovethatshit&amp;quot; (it was off of twitter, so please excuse the hashtag).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which in my mind, my on switch gets turned on and my mindset becomes &amp;quot;fuck yeah, let&amp;#39;s see where this goes.&amp;quot; We get to talking and I think things are going well, we&amp;#39;re hitting it off. The first night, we went from facebook messaging at 230a to phone and we didn&amp;#39;t even get off until 5 in the morning and that was because she had class and had to be up at 8. the next night, we&amp;#39;re on the phone from 11p-2a. just talking about our interests, hobbies, what we want to do with life, what we want to get done this summer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Friday comes around and I&amp;#39;m from Boston, the Tsarnaevs had just shot Sean Collier and the entire city was on lockdown. I&amp;#39;m at work and we&amp;#39;re texting to see if we&amp;#39;re both safe. I get off work and call her and see if she wanted company. We hung out all night, went for walks at a local pond, walking her dog, lying on a bench and just talking about how we grew up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All night, she&amp;#39;s telling me that this has been what she&amp;#39;s been wanting from someone. She had just gotten divorced from a six-year marriage (she&amp;#39;s 24). So in my head, I&amp;#39;m thinking &amp;quot;cool! I make her happy and I really like her personality and what she represents.&amp;quot; I had a feeling she was holding something back when she pulled away when I tried to kiss her. I wouldn&amp;#39;t say it was an awkward moment. We were at the pond, sitting on top of a cliff overlooking the road and pond. Romantic and intimate by my standards. Anyway, I spend the night, we snuggle, made waffles together the next morning and then had to get going for work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple of days, the same thing... She&amp;#39;s distant too. No phone calls, no texts. I eventually suck it up and text her to see what she&amp;#39;s been up to. Distant. At this point, I&amp;#39;m ready to give up on this one too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She comes clean and says that she&amp;#39;d been seeing someone else. Someone that she&amp;#39;d been wanting to be with, tells me I&amp;#39;m an awesome guy, tells me that she told her mother that she could see herself dating me. All the while, this means nothing to me. This is just talk. The one sentence she said, that I knew decided everything was, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re really great... but I don&amp;#39;t feel anything.&amp;quot; Boom... heart. dropped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying my hard to keep my head up and not get discouraged. But I&amp;#39;m trying harder to understand where or what I&amp;#39;m doing to cause me to fail so hard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m thinking... I&amp;#39;m taking it too fast... but I&amp;#39;m 23 fucking years old and I&amp;#39;m not dating 18 year olds. I know what I want and I want to date other people who know what they want. I&amp;#39;m huge on intimacy and if they aren&amp;#39;t, I gotta move on to the next one... right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I have some kind of character flaw?

{"downs":0,"secure_media":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So most my life I have been a pretty healthy person. It wasn&amp;#39;t until last summer when I started gaining weight uncontrollably is when everything started. First of all, I never told anyone about my weight gain I was pretty ashamed of myself. I&amp;#39;m only 5&amp;#39;1 and I had gotten up to 135lbs that summer when my normal weight ranges from 115-120. It may not seem like a lot of weight gain to y&amp;#39;all but to me it was a large amount especially in such a small amount of time. I mostly kept my weight gain to myself and tried everything I could to slim down, but nothing worked and I blamed the weight gain on the fact that I stopped taking Adderall ( I&amp;#39;ve been on it since I was 15 and I&amp;#39;m 21 now).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After summer had passed I started my senior year of college and I was honestly feeling horrible at this point. I was fat, my skin was as dry as the desert and it didn&amp;#39;t matter how much I slept I was ALWAYS tired! I still didn&amp;#39;t really complain or mention it to anyone because I figured &amp;quot;oh it&amp;#39;s just the stress of college blah blah blah&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A month into my last year of college, I had a doctors appointment for just a regular check up. The doctor told me I was at the age that I needed to have yearly blood tests, so I did what needed to be done and had my blood drawn for every test under the sun. A couple days later I got a call from the doctors office requesting I come in as soon as possible... I was pretty scared honestly because I didn&amp;#39;t know what to expect! Come to find out, they needed to draw more blood because my thyroid test came back as 11.32 when the range is between .40-4.50. At that point I had no clue what that meant but I just went along with it and got my blood drawn again for a retest. My second test came back again and this time it was a 9.72 and the test for TSH Free T4 was .93 which was okay, but my anti-thyroid antibodies were 570 when they should be 34 or less. I was told I had an under active thyroid and an autoimmune thyroid issue. I had no clue what it meant but my doctor explained it to me and I felt such a relief to know that it wasn&amp;#39;t just the stress of college that was bringing me down. Right away I was put on 25mcg of synthroid and told to come back for a follow up in 3months. Three months pass and my test comes back GREAT! I&amp;#39;m at a 1.64 and I was honestly feeling really good!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then suddenly around December, my scalp REEKED! I would wash my hair constantly in attempts to get rid of the smell but nothing would work! My poor boyfriend would constantly catch whiffs of my disgusting scalp and I just felt so embarrassed. My scalp smelled like a rotting animal and nothing would help it! I would shampoo and the smell would come back within hours! I finally got fed up and went to the school doctor last month, and he was stumped. He figured it could be a fungus in my scalp but told me to go to my family doctor because it could be related to my thyroid and she would be better to help me with that since she&amp;#39;s been working on it from the start. I gave in and went and she ran more tests. She ran the normal thyroid test which came back at 18.060, LH test which was 9.3, FSH was 4.6 and the Thyroid Peroxidase was 1244 when the range was 0-34. With these test results my doctor immediately raised my dose to 75mcg of synthroid and surprisingly enough my scalp stopped smelling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that only lasted for a little bit, my hair has started to smell again... not as bad but the smell is definitely back.

It wasn't until last summer when I started gaining weight uncontrollably is when everything started. First of all, I never told anyone about my weight gain I was pretty ashamed of myself. I'm only 5'1 and I had gotten up to 135lbs that summer when my normal weight ranges from 115-120. It may not seem like a lot of weight gain to y'all but to me it was a large amount especially in such a small amount of time. I mostly kept my weight gain to myself and tried everything I could to slim down, but nothing worked and I blamed the weight gain on the fact that I stopped taking Adderall ( I've been on it since I was 15 and I'm 21 now).\n\n\n   After summer had passed I started my senior year of college and I was honestly feeling horrible at this point. I was fat, my skin was as dry as the desert and it didn't matter how much I slept I was ALWAYS tired! I still didn't really complain or mention it to anyone because I figured \"oh it's just the stress of college blah blah blah\". \n\n\n   A month into my last year of college, I had a doctors appointment for just a regular check up. The doctor told me I was at the age that I needed to have yearly blood tests, so I did what needed to be done and had my blood drawn for every test under the sun. A couple days later I got a call from the doctors office requesting I come in as soon as possible... I was pretty scared honestly because I didn't know what to expect! Come to find out, they needed to draw more blood because my thyroid test came back as 11.32 when the range is between .40-4.50. At that point I had no clue what that meant but I just went along with it and got my blood drawn again for a retest. My second test came back again and this time it was a 9.72 and the test for TSH Free T4 was .93 which was okay, but my anti-thyroid antibodies were 570 when they should be 34 or less. I was told I had an under active thyroid and an autoimmune thyroid issue. I had no clue what it meant but my doctor explained it to me and I felt such a relief to know that it wasn't just the stress of college that was bringing me down. Right away I was put on 25mcg of synthroid and told to come back for a follow up in 3months. Three months pass and my test comes back GREAT! I'm at a 1.64 and I was honestly feeling really good!\n\n\n   But then suddenly around December, my scalp REEKED! I would wash my hair constantly in attempts to get rid of the smell but nothing would work! My poor boyfriend would constantly catch whiffs of my disgusting scalp and I just felt so embarrassed. My scalp smelled like a rotting animal and nothing would help it! I would shampoo and the smell would come back within hours! I finally got fed up and went to the school doctor last month, and he was stumped. He figured it could be a fungus in my scalp but told me to go to my family doctor because it could be related to my thyroid and she would be better to help me with that since she's been working on it from the start. I gave in and went and she ran more tests. She ran the normal thyroid test which came back at 18.060, LH test which was 9.3, FSH was 4.6 and the Thyroid Peroxidase was 1244 when the range was 0-34. With these test results my doctor immediately raised my dose to 75mcg of synthroid and surprisingly enough my scalp stopped smelling.\n\n\n   But that only lasted for a little bit, my hair has started to smell again... not as bad but the smell is definitely back. My last round of tests and dosage change was in March and I'm due for another doctors appointment this May... But I'm honestly horrified to go back... I know they are going to run tests again, but I'm scared something else will be wrong... \n\n\n   But the whole point of this post is, has anyone else dealt with such an odd symptom?!
