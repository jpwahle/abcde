It was a raw and primal passion unlike anything you'd ever felt and you knew this is what you wanted. You craved it.

We knew everything about each other. Well almost everything.\nTurns out being on your own for the first time isn't so easy and we quickly find ourself running out of money we had saved. At work one day you overhear a coworker talking about how she did a little online camera modeling and it was easy money some losers would donate money to watch a girl finger or strip down or whatever, this sounds like a great idea to you. You end up buying a webcam and doing a few of these and to your surprise you make a few hundred bucks. One night while your camming a random person says they'll deposit 2,000 into your PayPal if you suck a dick on the show. You want that money it would help us alot... but who could you ask. And then it hits you...your very handsome brother....but how could this be brought up.....and would it damage the relationship you have.\nThis would be very longterm and would escalate in kinkiness as we first do it to make money but then it turns into a deep sexual hunger for each other. It can be very open ended. We can go on to make pornos and fall in love there's all kind of possibilities.\nMy big kinks are\n-Having a massive cock 2ft+ this could play into our show as people are amazed how big I am -Excessive amounts of cum -slutty character -bimbo like \n\n-gladiator and the noble-\n\nThe Colloseum, the place where only blood and sand flow where gladiators kill and maim for the joy and love of the crowd.

Many believed he would be the next champion and win an audience with caesar. But there was something off about him but you had to meet him. As was customary of young noble ladies you decided to have me brought to your chambers one night to \"talk\" and this is where our story began.\n\nSo as I said this will be a very longterm rp with plenty of action,romance,smut and world building.

No, I was never hurt/assaulted by a guy to dislike being touched I just in general don&amp;#39;t like to be touched by guys. &lt;em&gt;so am I really bi if I only liked one girl? and what am I/whats going on if I don&amp;#39;t like guys touching me?&lt;/em&gt; oh and I&amp;#39;m not sure if this problem is under relationship advise but I thought it was close enough.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationship_advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0cn","subreddit_subscribers":621482,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Came out 5 months ago but I have only liked one girl.","ups":0,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8g4kmy/came_out_5_months_ago_but_i_have_only_liked_one/","user_reports":[],"visited":false,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

But we're both polyamorous. She has a boyfriend she sees periodically. I'd really like to date and get to know someone and maybe solidify a relationship that is long-term. I don't want to just see someone every once in a while. I am an emotionally robust man prone to intensity and bouts of poetic clarity. I think that if you give me half a chance I will knock your socks off, though maybe that sounds like bragging and is gross. I don't mean it that way.\n\nAs a DD and CG, I'm extremely sweet and loving. You may find my equal out there, but you will absolutely not find someone who surpasses me ability to be self-sacrificing, loving, gentle, patient, and delightfully devilish. My list of kinks is long and my list of limits short. I'd like it if you were the same way. Nothing illegal, no kids, no pets, no scat, no emesis. Other than that, just about anything is on the table if it is done safely, sanely, and consensually. I personally have a preference for wetlook, rubber, fetish, latex, and corsets.\n\nMy goal in a DDLG relationship is to assist the LG in becoming her best self. In other words, when you are feeling your Littlest, my goal is to sit with you, be with you, spend time investing my energy and effort in you, and help you learn to cope with your Big feelings better while embracing your Littleness more completely. Some doms go about BDSM and DDLG by using shame and humiliation. I find that while that can work in the short term, it is much better to remove any trace or shadow of guilt. Instead, I absolve my partner of all guilt and reward them lavishly for being dirty-minded. This rapidly heightens and intensifies the chemistry between us. It is an extremely intense experience, and some people in the past have been freaked out by that and have backed away. Especially if you have anxiety, let me know and we will talk about it before we experience that intensification together. I want your experience with me to be uplifting, fulfilling, and game-changing.\n\nIf you are going to date me and be Little with me, you need to be interested in intensity.\n\nAlright, that's enough for an introductory post.

I enjoy the sexual side of DDLG that involves deep trust and commitment and can allow for enjoyment of one another in ways that most vanilla relationships don&amp;#39;t approach. But I definitely have a part of DDLG that I keep totally free of sex. For example, I don&amp;#39;t like the idea of sexual behavior with someone who is in an age-regressed state. I won&amp;#39;t assign labels to that or wax loquacious about my feelings surrounding it, but it&amp;#39;s not for me.

What are you doing, or what have you done to fix your mindset and go on to live and work normally. \n\nI guess to start let's talk about my past. From age 7-16 I went thru alot of shit, never once had a normal growing up period during those times due to DSS, group homes, and foster care. I was moved around constantly, always meeting new people. I was heavily medicated from age 7-13 I believe. I had behavior issues, and was promiscuous due to knowing what sex was early on. I was told I have adhd, bipolar, depression and some other things I cannot remember. I was also super stubborn, I HATED therapy or anything that revolved around it, I thought it was so stupid. I didn't need it- or so I thought. Around age 14 or 15 I started smoking bud and that chilled me out. Like literally, I calmed tf down... I was able to break free of the system I so hated, and live with my mom once and for all.\nLet's fast forward to now. I'm 22, I am a young adult. For a while after leaving DSS I was finally normal, I was working, I was going to school, I had a normal social life. Life was normal. You would never know about my past, looking at me now. Like my personality is just so chill and normal. It's friggin bewildering to even me sometimes. Now these past 2 years I've been noticing a change to my mental health.. at first it was small mood changes, not wanting to wake up, occasional suicidal urges. Things I can handle. Now I know I am getting worse and I DO NOT know what to do. To put into retrospect what I am talking about here are some examples. I am severely isolating myself from my friends, like I have literally gone ghost on 2 really good friends going on almost 4 months now. They would call me, they texted me and not once did I pick up or ever give them any response back, I am doing this with former coworkers turned friends. In my heart I dont have any reason for this... they have never screwed me over, but for some reason I CANNOT find it in me to respond to them. So now due to my own personal actions I do not have any friends. Another change is my mood swings are getting very serious...  I was really debating about adding this part in here because I know how the internet is and how I will get bashed but here goes... I had an incident of note with my mom, where I beat on her. I have only done this once before when I was younger and going thru all my shit... It is wrong and I am disgusted by my past actions, I actually wish I got arrested, I love my mom even if we don't always get along. Here is the background. It was a miserable day for me I was severely depressed and I hadn't left my room for 3 days not even to eat, my room was dark, and I kept sleeping, I would only leave to use the restroom. My mom's friend came over to visit, and my mom had a conversation with her about how she was getting worried about me, because I was sleeping alot and not leaving my room. They knocked on my door and asked if I was straight, I said yeah I'm fine and continued sleeping. A few hours later I hear another knock on my door...it was the police, they had come to do a wellness check on me. My mom's friend told my mom to call the police and tell them what's going on, see if I need help. Now here's the thing I very much dislike my areas police force they are rude, and I associate them with negative things. (This is just my personal mindset it is not the point, just part of me trying to explain the situation) so I'm awake now my hearts pounding in my chest like WTF I have my pipes, bongs, and bud just chilling in my room I'm having a panic attack and all of a sudden I have a moment where my brain just shuts off, and I remember thinking my mom fuckin set me up. (I didn't know it was my moms friends idea at that time) I dont know why my thought process went straight to this idea but it did, and it set in motion what I'm going to tell you guys now... I started getting hysterical, so my moms friend left and I focused my attention on her I'm yelling why would you call the cops, I'm fine. So the cop stayed a little longer because of my hysterics and the fact that I'm berating my mom, but I slightly calmed down and he left. Now I'm in my room I'm raging at what just happened, I remember I went downstairs and flung everything off the dining room table, cussing her out yelling at her about the police coming,and slapping my mom in the face.. I started slapping her some more, she started to fight me back, now my mom is much older I am 22 she is 65. I had her against the wall she was starting to scream I remember I stopped because I saw the raw fear in her eyes and I remember thinking omg I might kill her, so I stopped went upstairs and started crying and punching my pillow anything to get the rage out and it was from that point that I knew my mental health was in serious decline. If I was functioning normally and rationally I would have been surprised at the police presence but i would have understood why it was there due to my behavior leading up to his visit. Instead I freaked out got paranoid, and physically attacked my own mother when she really didn't have much to do with it, she was just really worried... So with all that being said I definitely know I need help. I know for sure it's getting real bad and I think life situations are not helping. I've basically been working since I was 17, I got myself into deep debt at age 20-21  In September 2017 I left my stable, but minimum wage retail job to work in a call center way better pay way better hours, I still had my second retail job to fall back on too if the call center didn't work out, and boy oh boy that shit did not work out, then whaddya know as soon as I left the call center things started going down internally with management at my second job, and it started spilling over to the employees, and that was that. It was as if a bomb went off in my life and unraveled everything, I was jobless for like the first time I could remember, my Depression crept in quickly, thank God I was able to find a job quickly in November, it helped keep me afloat for a bit, and then things started popping off, it was a jewlery store, lots of competition, boss was a true narcissistic bitch, who had just got promoted to general manager of the store. So just add all that up and let your imagination run wild. I was hired as a seasonal jewlery specialist, it just was not working out for me in that field so I did not continue working after Christmas. After all this work shit started happening, I haven't been myself at all. I'm unmotivated, and I feel worthless like a failure. I've been trying to focus on my issues cuz I really don't try to pay attention to others cuz I know everyone has personal struggles and stresses but I see everyone succeeding in life well from what they show, their getting their bachelor degrees, getting new cars, getting their first apartments, and then you have me, got my h.s diploma finally last year, deep mounting debt at 22, still live with my mom. I fucked up so bad. I'm young so I know I have a chance to fix my fuck ups, but time is not on my side, it goes by so quick . I dont want to end up doing nothing with my life, but how can I succeed with my mental health decline and the main obstacle of debt in my path? I just am at a cross roads with a speeding train coming towards me, should I dodge it or step in front of it. If you actually read all of this THANK YOU, I know it may be jumbly and may not make sense, I just really needed to get this off my chest, and I know I can get some great suggestions on here from people who are similar and going through the same or similar shit. Also it would be great to have some people to talk to who get it. \n\nP.s I do not have stable insurance, or any income at the moment, I'm in the process of looking for work, and getting my insurance straightened out so I can get a therapy referral from a primary doctor.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;long post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just need to know if there are people who are going through similar problems like me. What are you doing, or what have you done to fix your mindset and go on to live and work normally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess to start let&amp;#39;s talk about my past. From age 7-16 I went thru alot of shit, never once had a normal growing up period during those times due to DSS, group homes, and foster care. I was moved around constantly, always meeting new people. I was heavily medicated from age 7-13 I believe. I had behavior issues, and was promiscuous due to knowing what sex was early on. I was told I have adhd, bipolar, depression and some other things I cannot remember. I was also super stubborn, I HATED therapy or anything that revolved around it, I thought it was so stupid. I didn&amp;#39;t need it- or so I thought. Around age 14 or 15 I started smoking bud and that chilled me out. Like literally, I calmed tf down... I was able to break free of the system I so hated, and live with my mom once and for all.\nLet&amp;#39;s fast forward to now. I&amp;#39;m 22, I am a young adult. For a while after leaving DSS I was finally normal, I was working, I was going to school, I had a normal social life. Life was normal. You would never know about my past, looking at me now. Like my personality is just so chill and normal. It&amp;#39;s friggin bewildering to even me sometimes. Now these past 2 years I&amp;#39;ve been noticing a change to my mental health.. at first it was small mood changes, not wanting to wake up, occasional suicidal urges. Things I can handle. Now I know I am getting worse and I DO NOT know what to do. To put into retrospect what I am talking about here are some examples. I am severely isolating myself from my friends, like I have literally gone ghost on 2 really good friends going on almost 4 months now. They would call me, they texted me and not once did I pick up or ever give them any response back, I am doing this with former coworkers turned friends. In my heart I dont have any reason for this... they have never screwed me over, but for some reason I CANNOT find it in me to respond to them. So now due to my own personal actions I do not have any friends. Another change is my mood swings are getting very serious...  I was really debating about adding this part in here because I know how the internet is and how I will get bashed but here goes... I had an incident of note with my mom, where I beat on her. I have only done this once before when I was younger and going thru all my shit... It is wrong and I am disgusted by my past actions, I actually wish I got arrested, I love my mom even if we don&amp;#39;t always get along. Here is the background. It was a miserable day for me I was severely depressed and I hadn&amp;#39;t left my room for 3 days not even to eat, my room was dark, and I kept sleeping, I would only leave to use the restroom. My mom&amp;#39;s friend came over to visit, and my mom had a conversation with her about how she was getting worried about me, because I was sleeping alot and not leaving my room. They knocked on my door and asked if I was straight, I said yeah I&amp;#39;m fine and continued sleeping. A few hours later I hear another knock on my door...it was the police, they had come to do a wellness check on me. My mom&amp;#39;s friend told my mom to call the police and tell them what&amp;#39;s going on, see if I need help. Now here&amp;#39;s the thing I very much dislike my areas police force they are rude, and I associate them with negative things. (This is just my personal mindset it is not the point, just part of me trying to explain the situation) so I&amp;#39;m awake now my hearts pounding in my chest like WTF I have my pipes, bongs, and bud just chilling in my room I&amp;#39;m having a panic attack and all of a sudden I have a moment where my brain just shuts off, and I remember thinking my mom fuckin set me up.

I have zero resentment for people with different opinions - I think everyone is more or less doing their best with the information they get and the culture they grew up in.

The school is mediocre, but the instructor and classmates are pretty chill :) I&amp;#39;m as bad a procrastinator as always, and that disappoints me, but overall I&amp;#39;m actually doing ok so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be great to meet a potential partner, but I&amp;#39;m also happy to make friends. I don&amp;#39;t get out much. I have several close friends I don&amp;#39;t talk to. From time to time I&amp;#39;ll binge on a book or TV show, but these days I spend most of my time on youtube or, &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;, the Washington Post. I really liked The Shape of Water. I listen to a lot of stuff, but my favorite is stoner rock/prog rock/Tool &amp;lt;3. I am a dedicated reader of webcomics. I like to draw and fantasize about publishing my own comic, but do very little of either. I&amp;#39;m really not a snob about anything, but I like people who have strong opinions about their art and media, whatever they may be :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m very political in a mostly passive way, pretty far left. I have zero resentment for people with different opinions - I think everyone is more or less doing their best with the information they get and the culture they grew up in. I just find arguing about politics soul crushing, so prefer someone like minded :/ I&amp;#39;d get along best with someone who tries to keep track of what&amp;#39;s going on in the world, and is horrified by it :P&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like the way I look. I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;10&amp;quot;, in decent shape, surprisingly considering my sedentary lifestyle, wavy black hair currently on the long side. I shave sometimes ^^. I actually want to start paying better attention to all aspects of my appearance, and possibly experiment with makeup, so if you think you might enjoy advising me... ;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this long and self indulgent post. I just like to be upfront, and look forward to reading similarly long and self indulgent pm&amp;#39;s!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"r4r","subreddit_id":"t5_2rn0e","subreddit_subscribers":164451,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"26[M4F]Israel/anywhere ~ Let's be depressed together","ups":1,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/8g4z0f/26m4fisraelanywhere_lets_be_depressed_together/","user_reports":[],"visited":false,"whitelist_status":"promo_adult","wls":1}
