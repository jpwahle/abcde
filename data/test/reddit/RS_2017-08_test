So I've been with my wife for 9 yrs and from the start her aunt has been hitting on me. But the 2 most recent ones have been by far the most noticeable ones. Ok let me start off by saying she's in her 40s and I'm 27 yrs old. My wife knows I'm into milfs and her aunt is a milf. She is fucking hot, nice ass, nice legs, and perfect tits. So anyways, so it's Christmas and we are at the aunts house. We are playing a board game and it's a bunch of us playing around the dinner table. She's standing by her husband and I'm clear on the other side. She finally decides to sit down but chooses to sit by me. Nobody finds it weird but me. Anyways time goes by and she keeps rubbing her knee on my knee. Of course nobody can see these and I turn to her to see if she's doing this on purpose. I make eye contact with her and she smiles back like she knows what the fuck she is doing. We get done playing and she gets up to get a drink and as she gets up she puts her hand on my thigh and uses it for support. I'm trying not to freak out but she looks me dead in the eye and gives me one of those fuck me smiles. I instantly get a fucking hard on. She walks away and doesn't say nothing to me all night after that. I feel weird and kinda guilty so I mention to my wife that her aunt was hitting on me. She thinks I'm just into myself. That's the first incident now for the second one. Sorry for taking forever. So this is a month ago. We are at my in laws place and the aunt is there as well. I think nothing of it and greet my mother in law with a hug. The aunt gets up and greets me with a hug as well but she rubs her hand down to my ass. So I turn around fast and then she rubs her hand across my arm and stops at my wrist. She does all this in front of my wife and mother in law. Also in the kitchen is my sis in law. I sit down at table and the aunt decides to be behind my chair and I'm too uncomfortable to sit up straight bc she's right behind me. So I'm kinda on the edge of the chair and the door opens and everybody turns around to look and that's when she decides to massage my neck and shoulders. I fucking get so hard that I'm wondering if my in laws can fucking see my boner. Everybody turns back around and she quickly takes her hands off of me. She leaves and it's just me, my wife, and my sis in law. I bring it up and this time I have a witness. My sis in law confirms what I've been saying. That her aunt is hitting on me. My wife thinks we both are overreacting. Now that you read my story. What should I do? I don't wanna cheat but I've had a crush on her before I was even wth my wife. My fetish is milfs and I've always wanted to fuck my aunt and technically she is my aunt. She's so fucking hot and idk how I can approach this without jeopardizing my marriage. Idk if I should make a move? And if I do, idk how I would start.

That's important because, the first time I smoked cannabis was 13. I hated it. It was dysphoric, I felt awful, I wanted to die, I couldn't wait for it to be over (which was about 4 hours). This happened everytime I smoked weed up until I was about 19.    \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen I smoked at 19 and into 20, I really liked it. It was really strong, and it was a little overwhelming, as in I wouldn't want to do it more than once a day because I would be exhausted from the experience. I'd say I was consistently hitting 6-7s and they lasted about 4 hours long. I smoked consistently with my then time girlfriend because she smoked as welll. It was always a one and done thing. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFast forward to 22 - I have my MMJC, so I have access to licenced producers. I'm liking it I'm liking it a lot. But it's never more than [2].

It moreso has an uplifting effect of my mood and socialability.  \n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nCreativity and abstract thinking also seems diminished in comparison to the glory days. \n\nThis happens both with dispensary and street. I've taken t breaks, sometimes months at a time (upto 4 months once) and the results remain the same.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRegarding dosage, I hit a ceiling after a certain amount of cannabis and I don't go any further. I've had 300mg thc in a capsule, highest I got was a [2]. Another time, I had 4 edible cookies of unknown strength but they were listed as \"double strength\" by the vendor, staggered by an hour each. Same result. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs far as smoking goes, I've smoked an entire half ounce in a day to attempt to break [2]. It was a dumb idea. I regretted it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAm I alone in this? Anyone else know why this happens and what I can do about it? I really like weed therapeutically, but I enjoyed using it recreationally from time to time, like on weekends and at social events. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso, this happens with alcohol. I often have racked up a bill of 6-8 beers during happy hour. (3:00-6:00) and I feel fine except I need to pee and walk funny. I go home after and wanna sleep, and wake up with a hangover.

I wrote a lot and am not sure how to organize it.\n\nHello,\n\nI was misdiagnosed with depression and given antidepressants six years ago.  I just went through a hyper-manic state.  I canceled my lease(paying 7000 dollars in fees) and moved back across the country from a job I've only had for three weeks.\n\nI'm seeing my psychiatrist on Wednesday.  The damage to my life has not been great.  But the damage mentally has been large.  I can now take a tally of it.\n\nMy manic state was based on my depression at the time.  My mania's obsession became to damage myself emotionally so that I would eventually kill myself. I understand that most people go through self harm, but I have always been more afraid of shame and failure than physical harm.  As such, hurting myself mentally longterm became my primary focus.\n\nTo do this I fought to make my non-manic mind hate things about myself.  For example, I am a minority and when my mania increases I would read breibart, and stormfront to try and associate my opinion with theirs.  I'm a man and I would masturbate repeatedly while forcing myself to think I'm a girl.  I did this almost everyday for six years.  I now have gender dysmorphia issues.  This is the largest issue I have as there is no natural counter to solve it.  \n\nI was a good person before, and the goal of my mania was to make myself hate everything about myself so I would eventually commit suicide.\n\nThere are two parts of me left, the mania that wishes to damage myself more, and a horrible person that I have created through that mania.  Early on I would wonder why I was doing this to myself, eventually I just accepted it and allowed it to keep going.  I now read racist newspapers and feel good about it.  I rationalize and support their arguments even without my mania.   Knowing I would see my psychiatrist this week and try and get help with the gender dysmorphia I've masturbated several times, and mentally pushed myself to think I'm a girl.  Even this message is just a way of hurting myself more because of how embarrassing it is to write.\n\nI put myself back on the antidepressants so I could do so.  I now mentally associate myself with racists and feel good while reading their opinions.  I listen happily when people make bigoted remarks because they make me feel better. Logically I don't know why they do, but when reading them I feel like their comments are comforting me.\n\nI'm a gross and disgusting person, and that is all that is left of me.\n\nI have three options.  \n1.  Refocus my mania to try and fix myself.\n2.  Go into a manic state to kill myself.  My original diagnosis of depression was caused by this and I was only saved because my Mom walked in on me.\n3.  Get depressed enough that I hate my current self and change.  This was my original plan before I had done enough damage to cause any cognitive problems.  \n\nCounterpoints to argument 1:  I am 24.  I only have a few more years where my mind is plastic.  I don't know if I will be able to cure the gender dysmorphia/sex issues I have in those few years.  That is the issue that scares me the most.  I also have never been able to choose what my Mania focuses on.\n\nCounterpoint to argument 2:  I have a loving family.  I told my parents I think I'm bipolar, and they told me it wasn't true, but they also said they would support me no matter what and that they would always love me.  I don't know how to do this while giving them closure.\n\nCounterpoints to argument 3:  This was my original plan.  I have never been able to control my depression, and the person I have become isn't easily depressed.  Between myself and my mania I have no part of my mind I can trust to do this.\n\n\nThank you for reading this.  I think I am only doing this to make me hate myself more, and follow my mania.  But even the person I was before would have wanted to do this.\n\ntl;dr:  I'd really like you to read this.   That said, if anyone has experience with managing bipolar disorder I would really appreciate it.  Even a couple days of not being manic could get me really far.

I don't know who exactly but judging from most of my past experiences, I know I haven't found that particular someone. I guess, what I'm trying to say is I want to try looking here. I'm looking for someone beautiful and wild and so fragmented loving them will hurt.\n\n \n\nWhen I say wild, I don't mean a middle aged man looking to score with a young woman by boasting of his impressive sex toy collection. Please, no. I mean, the internet is a pretty big place.

I'm 30 years old and I am looking to get into the Security Industry.  I have a D License and I have some experience from about a year ago where I had a do nothing job at a Sysco facility. The job didn't challenge me in the slightest, and I was more of a data entry person who wore a security uniform than anything else. \n\nNow I want to get my G License to become an armed guard.  I am interviewing with Loomis at the end of the week. If the Interview goes well they said they will pay for my G License training and I can work for them, which is good because I am barely making enough money to keep my head above water with the job I currently have. \n\nI have two questions I wanted to ask, and I am delighted that this subReddit exists so that I can ask them. Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated. \n\n1. I am normally a very good interview. I don't get very nervous and I am a good talker. But what pointers could you guys give me about the interview itself? I really want this job and I don't want to mess up and accidentally say something that can ruin my chances. What are some pitfalls I should avoid? \n\n2. I am short on cash and I am not sure how this works. I have a handgun that will work as my own service weapon, but what else should I be expected to buy before my first day? Is there a place where I can get these things cheap? \n\nAnd of course, I'll gladly take any/all advice you guys want to throw my way.

My nparents (specifically my nmom) can't stand the fact that I want to do more with my summer than just work a crappy retail job and sit at home. I'm 19 now and home for the summer from college. I have an on campus job lined up when I go back, I'm involved in several extracurriculars on campus, and pretty good grades. I don't drink at all and I only started smoking weed in college to help with my anxiety. I've never done anything dangerous or bad except for going behind nmom's back to get treatment for my depression (which she's still mad about.)\n\nAnyways. I'm upset because I can't leave the house without my nmom and ndad screaming at me  for not asking them first, even though I'm a fucking adult that can drive on my own.  They say having friends is a waste of time and that people outside the church or family will leave you in the end. My nmom accused my boyfriend of  giving me an STD, only wanting to use me for sex, and  sleeping around behind my back with literally zero evidence to back up her paranoid claims. \n\nMy bf's family invited me to a festival that they go to every year earlier in the summer. My nparents would have to do absolutely nothing for me-I could pay for my own ticket, bf would pick me up, I would buy my own food, etc. Yet according to my nparents there's no way I can go because I'm extremely untrustworthy, I'm secretly doing drugs and drinking, I'm going to get knocked up, a terrorist is going to bomb the concert, the world is going to end and the second coming of Christ will begin (no, seriously.) Later in the summer Bf's family invited me to a day trip they were having to a nearby city. After nmom accused me of lying and just saying I was going to have sex with bf all day, Bf's dad sent nmom a detailed itinerary of what was going to happen on the trip, proving that our plans were legit. I STILL wasn't allowed to go because there could be terrorists, people get raped and murdered in cities, AND because I was \"being a brat\" about not being able to go to the festival. Even when I tell them the truth about my plans they think I'm lying, so what's the even the point?\n\nI want to be able to go out and actually do things, not just sit in the house and talk about how evil gay people are all day. There's a study abroad opportunity I would love to go on that I can pay for, but I doubt they'll let me go because it's in Mexico and that's where all the cocaine and drug dealers are from.\n\nI just feel like I'm missing out on so much. I haven't done anything this summer except for work and occasionally see my bf. I know I'm getting old enough to move out soon but there's no way they'll let me leave unless I get a police escort. Even if I did leave, I don't make nearly enough money to be financially independent of them. So, for now, I'm just stuck in my shitty house looking at other people's fun vacations and wishing that could be me. I'm filled with dread thinking of next summer where I'll no doubt be stuck at home feeling like shit again. \n\nOn the bright side I leave for college in ten days! :D","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Missing out on youth/teen years because of n?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6qsxx4/missing_out_on_youthteen_years_because_of_n/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

I am fine with playing even until 2:00AM BST.\n* You consider yourself a supportive person and you strongly avoid making other people feel bad.\n* Everybody makes mistakes, you should be absolutely comfortable with both receiving and giving me constructive feedback on our play.\n* **You want to improve.**\n* You want to take part in tournaments every now and then.\n* You rarely tilt.\n\nPoints in bold are the most important to me.

I was basically an \"asexual\" before, and it was hard socially speaking, because I didn't relate to most people, and if I was asked what I liked I always tried to avoid the topic. If I was too pushed I'd just say \"I don't really have any interest honestly\" even if most didn't believe me. \nMost relatives probably think I'm just too timid when it comes to sexuality in general, some might think I'm homosexual or something similar. I don't really know what they think of me regarding sexuality because they never told me what they think of it about me. \n\nThe truth is that somehow (can't exactly tell since when but it started some time in the beginning of 2014) I started finding mares sexually attractive. I didn't want to admit it at first but I ended up giving up. It wasn't even a fetish, it was the only thing that I found sexually appealing at all: female equines. With the time I also started fantasizing about having sexual intercourse with a big female canine, but my biggest appeal was and still is female equines, but we would be getting kind off topic there. Eventually I also started finding women attractive too, maybe a bit more visually appealing than canines, but not more than equines at all. With this I mean I would have sex with a woman (not any ofc, but thats also off-topic) but what always excites me the most, infinitely more than that, is the idea of doing it with an equine (I wouldn't get an animal just for sex, and I don't see them as sex toys, I know there's a lot of morality playing here but it is also besides the point, but believe me I'd never do anything bad in that regard). \nAnyway I'm a virgin, never did anything yet nor plan on doing it with an animal unless I'm 100% sure it will be okay for me and for the animal, which wont happen any time soon because of other factors (like me not having my own private place yet and more reasons).\n\nThe point of this is that my past makes it even harder, because going from completely asexual, or timid (on the eyes of the rest) to \"wanting to fuck animals\" is very critical.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Sex talks with relatives and the frustration:**\n\n\nAnyway, two of my cousins really pushed me into the sex topic and forced me to say I'm asexual (I lied, I stopped being \"asexual\" a couple of years before saying this, but I was too afraid of even saying any bit of truth about my sexuality, even about finding women at least somewhat attractive). One of them didn't believe me and made me swear it to him many times, he even once said \"everyone wants to fuck something, even if its a goat or anything, it doesnt matter, its just impossible not to have desire at all\". I giggled, but still shrug'd it out and kept saying I am an \"exception\". \n\nWhy do I keep lying and not even saying I like women when I actually do, you may ask? Even if I like mares more than women, why not at least say I like women and not mention the rest? If you are wondering this, I don't blame you, but the answer is that it really hurts me a lot to say things that are only partially true, I find it very hard and it makes me feel bad with myself. I would do it, but not to people I trust a lot. I told my cousins everything except this, because I'm too afraid, but I need someone to talk this with. It would really help me. Being completely alone and saying it only in this site is honestly frustrating me, because I feel I'm going nowhere this way. \n\nMy cousin takes everything too seriously and he looks concerned and preoccupied a lot about things I don't even really find very concerning (I think he exaggerates and worries too much about everything). This makes me feel that if I ever tell him about this, he would freak out and, even though it's not something he usually does, he might tell someone else. \nSometimes I think, what if I stopped caring and let everyone know? like, not saying it all the time, but starting answering with the truth every time I'm asked. It would spread and make everyone around me know, and I wouldn't go to jail or anything because interspecies sex isn't illegal in my place (will probably be very soon though). The reason I don't do this is because most people would think I'm a rapist. People see no difference between a zoophilic and a pedophile. It doesn't matter how hard you try to explain how consent can exist between different species, they will never believe it unless they are extremelly open minded, and I imagine it would ruin my life for good. People would fear I want to rape their pets or some ridiculous shit like that.\nI also think I screwed up by swearing to my cousin many times about me being asexual, because he would probably be offended if I tell him the truth now. He surelly won't be very mad at me because of my lie, he's actually a nice person, but of one thing I'm almost sure... he would never understand it. He will probably think the only way to make it possible is through rape and I really doubt he will change his mind. I imagine he would react like \"It's okay, I can't judge you, as long as it remains a fantasy\". I've heard people say this a lot about things that aren't even as rare as zoophilia, like homosexuality, so it really scares the shit out of me considering telling someone about this.\n\nI've read some posts of people talking about this with their relatives and they being ok with it, but I really can't imagine that happening here. Maybe it has something to do with the life style? Myself and everyone I know lives in a big city so there's really no much contact with animals in our daily lives, I don't know if that increases the odds of them freaking out even more or not.\nThere's NO way I'm telling this to my parents because they are somewhat conservative and they never keep secrets at all, my mother would tell literally everyone, so that's a no.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**So I ask:**\n\n\nWhy bother telling them? Even if they don't judge me, they would surely avoid talking about the topic because they are ver reserved people, so I imagine it would probably be an only one time talk and never again. I'm really confused. The best thing for me would be knowing someone IRL that is also like me, I think it would help me a lot in so many levels. I really need to talk about this, about my sexuality, with the people I trust, but it's just so scary. Am I being too paranoid? Things won't be as bad as I actually believe they would be? \n\n\nDo you have any suggestions? I'm sorry for the gigantic wall of text and thank you a lot if you read all of it. It really means a lot to me.\n\n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"zoophilia","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3zx","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[NS] I'm very afraid of people knowing, but I really need someone I can talk about this with (Seeking help)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/zoophilia/comments/6qt26x/ns_im_very_afraid_of_people_knowing_but_i_really/","whitelist_status":"house_only"}

I am doing it mostly to build a better base of strength / fitness for the rest of my life; I don't have any goals of getting really muscular or lifting to compete or anything like that. Taking that into consideration, I don't expect the maximum amount that I'll ever lift to really be *that* high, though I don't really know what the number would be expected to be. I'm 5'2 and expect that I'd end up weighing around 110-115lb if that makes a difference.\n\nI bought a standard barbell and some weights for it that total up to a maximum of about 100lbs that I have available. I am coming close to using/exceeding that weight for some lifts (deadlifts and glute bridges for right now), so I am looking at needing to get more weights. I am torn between buying more standard size weights to add to what I already have, or essentially starting over with a set Olympic weights + bar instead.\n\nBuying more standard weights would obvious cost less because I'm adding on to what I already have, but the Olympic weights seem like they would be more future-proof. The standard bar that I have has a max capacity of around 250lbs - I'd have to invest another ~$150 in buying more weights for it to get to that limit, and that would sort of go to waste if it turns out I ever want to lift more than 250lbs (which I don't know if I will or not). The shorter/lighter bar that I already have is also easier to maneuver around for me at the moment, and on most lifts I use the barbell for I'm not even at the point where I could use an Olympic bar by itself. I do wish I had some 45lb plates for the size of them - I've resorted to propping things up on aerobics steps for now for deadlifts/glute bridges/hip thrusts but that actually makes the bar a bit too high. I have seen 50lb standard plates available online which I assume would be approximately the same diameter?\n\nWhat do you think? Would the standard weights be sufficient, either for a lifetime or at least for another few years? Or should I just bite the bullet and switch to Olympic weights? I'm hesitant to sink any more money into standard weights if they will quickly become obsolete for me, but I'm also not keen on the idea of having to run out and buy a set of Olympic weights in the next few weeks if I want to progress with my workout.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"xxfitness","subreddit_id":"t5_2ryzy","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Should I continue with standard weights or upgrade to Olympic?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/6qt2oz/should_i_continue_with_standard_weights_or/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

I've got my own place, my own car, etc - the basics are locked down. I'm a pretty huge nerd - board games, card games, video games, Dungeons and Dragons - I really hit pretty much all of it. You don't have to love this stuff, but you should probably go in realizing it's a part of who I am that's probably never going anywhere (if I was gonna outgrow it, I think I'd have done it by now).\n\nI'm also a nerd in the sense that I enjoy learning stuff and figuring out how things work - I can have fun playing around in excel for an afternoon learning how to make my budget spreadsheet calculate more efficiently. I subscribe to places like /r/philosophy and /r/depthhub and enjoy the time I spend there. If you'd enjoy swapping articles like that and discussing them, you'd probably enjoy me.\n\nI am decent at cooking and actively working to get better - though lately I've been enjoying my new Costco membership which means not having to cook nearly as often (their premade stuff is pretty badass). As far as honest assessment of appearances go, I'm probably middle of the road - the last few months have knocked me out of the gym (promotion at work, move to Houston, etc) - I'm 5'10\", ~185, dark hair, dark eyes. If you feel strongly about athletic, I'm at least six months away from that, but I'll likely end up there.\n\nI've got a large amount of drive when it comes to work - I work 50-60 hours most weeks at a job I really enjoy. I don't complain a lot about work, and I don't really resent the hours. I'm lucky enough to legitimately like my job - if I'm pulling overtime to get something done, I'm cool with that. \n\nI've got two cats. I prefer cats to dogs, but that's largely because I'm pretty sure that having a dog in an apartment is like the third or fourth circle of hell, at the very least. I like commas, I feel strongly about the Oxford Comma, and I think that \"intensely passionate about useless shit\" is actually a pretty good summary of who I am as a person. I prefer to stay in rather than go out, I like to chat a lot but not necessarily have a lot of plans with my SO - my ideal partner is pretty okay with chilling in the same room while doing our own thing for a fair amount of the time we spend together.\n\nYou'll notice we're five paragraphs in and I haven't said anything about D/s yet. That's pretty intentional. I don't think that good relationships start with a list of kinks and thorough descriptions of how I want to bang you. I've been doing the casual thing for a fairly long time now, and I'm pretty ready to move forward to something more serious.\n\nWhat kind of serious? I enjoy D/s inside and outside the bedroom. Actually, moreso outside it in some ways - I'm fine with cuffs and paddles and spankings and all that. I enjoy inflicting pain in moderation. I've done consensual non-consent and enjoyed it thoroughly. I don't do blood play, bathroom play, or weapon play. My main enjoyment of D/s has always been outside of the bedroom though - the power imbalance in daily life is what really grabs me and focuses my attention.\n\nI'm not looking for something crazy hardcore - I'm closer to 50s housewife than 'I have a cage and you sleep in it when I'm pissed at you'. I enjoy free use (I.E. not needing your permission before we have sex), and light control of you outside the bedroom (I.E. you getting approval on your outfits from me, you checking with me before you make plans, that kind of thing). Essentially, I'd like a relationship where decision-making is split more 60/40 or 70/30 rather than 50/50. I'm a big fan of you asking me stuff rather than telling me stuff, and I'm a big fan of saying 'yes' to things.\n\nFor major life choices, I'm think you should be making your own. If our relationship developed to the point where major life decisions became 'us' decisions rather than 'you' decisions, I'd want that kind of thing to be 50/50. I'm not interested in deciding if you should quit your job or go to grad school or whatever. I'll probably have opinions, maybe even strong ones, but I don't want our D/s to extend to those. I think those should be either your choice, or a choice we make as a couple.\n\nI'm well past due to wrap this up, so - about you. I don't really have strong feelings about age (though much older than me might be a deal breaker? I'm legitimately not sure), I don't really care what you do, and I don't really care how much money you have (more or less, money's a tool, so I don't find it threatening). I guess if you have craploads of debt and no plan to deal with it, that might be an issue. I don't care if you're super outgoing, as long as you're cool with my pace being a bit slower - I'm never gonna be the kind of guy who is hyped to do social stuff seven days a week.\n\nWhat I do care about - the relationship style isn't really negotiable for me. That is, some amount of 24/7 needs to be a thing we're doing. The exact amount is flexible, but this isn't something I do purely for fun, it's something I really want as a permanent aspect of our relationship. I do care if you're super overweight - I'm not perfect, and you don't need to be either, but physical attraction isn't really optional for me. I enjoy feminine girls, but that's something that I'm fine working on as part of the D/s thing - I.E. you don't already need to own a closet full of dresses or be a youtube makeup tutorial star. I would really like it if you're passionate about something - I don't care what. Work, a hobby, knitting - whatever. The 'what' is way less important than the emotion behind it.\n\nFinally - local would be nice. \"Local\" being within 4 or 5 hours - so the Austin/Dallas/Houston/San Antonio range. I'm fine with driving, and as long as we can make a couple weekends a month work, that'd be fine with me for quite a while.\n\nWhew. I think we're done here.

To act, look and feel like badasses during the entire process.\n\nBYLAWS\n\nThis clan is governed by four core pillars of conduct: brotherhood, maturity, communication and style. Within each pillar exists rules that are followed by all clan members.\n\nPillar I: Brotherhood\n\n1. In this clan, we are all brothers and sisters. We are also actual friends, and each member of the clan should be on your friends list.\n2. You must be ok with sharing your real name on PSN with all clan members.\n3. Over time, you must get to know everyone and treat each clan member with respect.\n\nPillar 2: Maturity\n\n4. This guild is primarily for adults and young adults in college. Younger players that display maturity and interact well with older players may be admitted, subject to approval.\n\nPillar 3: Communication\n\n5. This guild operates using an advanced level of communication during raids and PVP.\n6. A quality microphone that does not make any discernible noise, buzzing or echo is required.\n7. Members agree to honor their word and their agreements. For example, If you promise to raid Tuesday night at 9 PM EST, be there and on time. If you can't be there, you must communicate to the group and find a replacement.\n\nPillar 4: Style\n\n8. This clan does not worship the current meta and we do not mimic what everyone else is doing.\n9. We are unique and we play how we want. We use the guns we like and find the most fun. If you want to use a Boolean Gemini or No Land Beyond in PVP or a raid and can DPS or maintain a positive K/D ratio, we welcome and encourage that.\n\nThese rules are necessary to facilitate an environment of fun, fraternity and success.  Some of them may sound too rigid or military like, but when everyone is held to the same standard, performance dramatically increases and everyone benefits. That means much more loot with much less frustration! \n\nIf you meet all these rules and agree to abide by the bylaws, please send a request to join the group and we'll have a conversation for you joining the clan.

He hits my dog when she does something wrong, he actually has pushed her down the stairs before. \n\n     And as of late, he was in jail for a week, my mom bailed him out with money that came from nowhere, because he broke into a woman's house and robbed her.

I've always despised the need for skinniness in our culture that drives people to starve themselves and the anxiety that is caused when people can't fit a size 1.\n\nBig is beautiful, and more importantly, natural. But our society isn't conducive to that. However, I aim to do what I can to curb that in whatever small way I can. I'm the type of guy that will give attention to the girls and guys at parties and events that everyone else ignores because their not super buff or super skinny. Doesn't matter to me if your 30 pounds overweight or 300, your beautiful in my eyes. I have a special love for pregnant women, as I understand the difficulty with your body being changed in uncontrollable ways, and how it can be incredibly stressful.\n\nI had great success with a guy last time I posted this as an M4A post, so I'm hoping that some women might be willing to give me a shot.\n\nA little about me. 20, caucasian, bearded, but the fact that most people probably care about with me is my height. I'm 6'10\". I work in a mountain sports shop, but am working through school to become a manual therapist, (Effectively a specialized chiropractor). I'm on the skinny side but athletic and strong, along with being very dexterous.\n\nHere is what I am offering. First online chat through reddit PM to see if we are looking for the same thing. If we click, then I am looking to meet up, and have some fun. However I'm a gentleman before I am a stud. I will take you out to dinner, and give any amount of massage or cuddles you want. Then afterward, if your not in the mood for sex, thats fine! Cuddles and making somebody relaxed honestly 60% of the enjoyment for me, as hard as that may be to believe, since 90% of men my age basically are just sex crazed apes.\n\nSpecialty for pregnant women, I have a fair amount of practice with massage for pregnant women, and though my training is not complete, I'm quite accomplished at relaxing and soothing the aching muscles and joints that come from carrying a child.\n\nTo make myself clear, I am not looking for a relationship. I am in a loving relationship with a wonderful boyfriend, but we are in an open relationship because we can't see each other enough to satiate our need for cuddles or intimacy. So I am looking for one or more of three things. a FWB, a cuddlebuddy, or a friend. Any of those or all three are totally on the table.\n\nLastly, I should note, my place does not work as far as staying at for cuddling or massage or a night spent together. I have room mates with a specific no fucking in the apartment allowed rule, so even cuddling or me giving you a massage could get me kicked out. I am open to either your place, a split cost hotel, or if your feeling adventurous, I have a truck with a full size bed and an inflatable mattress.\n\nLastly, don't worry, I just got STD tested about two weeks ago, and I'm clean. I know thats much more of an issue with bi guys like me, so I get checked after every partner.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtyr4r","subreddit_id":"t5_2vqun","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"20 [M4F] Denver Area - Looking for a night of fun with any BBW, Thick, Chubby, or Pregnant Woman","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/6qt5xk/20_m4f_denver_area_looking_for_a_night_of_fun/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw"}

I've got my own place, my own car, etc - the basics are locked down. I'm a pretty huge nerd - board games, card games, video games, Dungeons and Dragons - I really hit pretty much all of it. You don't have to love this stuff, but you should probably go in realizing it's a part of who I am that's probably never going anywhere (if I was gonna outgrow it, I think I'd have done it by now).\n\nI'm also a nerd in the sense that I enjoy learning stuff and figuring out how things work - I can have fun playing around in excel for an afternoon learning how to make my budget spreadsheet calculate more efficiently. I subscribe to places like /r/philosophy and /r/depthhub and enjoy the time I spend there. If you'd enjoy swapping articles like that and discussing them, you'd probably enjoy me.\n\nI am decent at cooking and actively working to get better - though lately I've been enjoying my new Costco membership which means not having to cook nearly as often (their premade stuff is pretty badass). As far as honest assessment of appearances go, I'm probably middle of the road - the last few months have knocked me out of the gym (promotion at work, move to Houston, etc) - I'm 5'10\", ~185, dark hair, dark eyes. If you feel strongly about athletic, I'm at least six months away from that, but I'll likely end up there.\n\nI've got a large amount of drive when it comes to work - I work 50-60 hours most weeks at a job I really enjoy. I don't complain a lot about work, and I don't really resent the hours. I'm lucky enough to legitimately like my job - if I'm pulling overtime to get something done, I'm cool with that. \n\nI've got two cats. I prefer cats to dogs, but that's largely because I'm pretty sure that having a dog in an apartment is like the third or fourth circle of hell, at the very least. I like commas, I feel strongly about the Oxford Comma, and I think that \"intensely passionate about useless shit\" is actually a pretty good summary of who I am as a person. I prefer to stay in rather than go out, I like to chat a lot but not necessarily have a lot of plans with my SO - my ideal partner is pretty okay with chilling in the same room while doing our own thing for a fair amount of the time we spend together.\n\nYou'll notice we're five paragraphs in and I haven't said anything about D/s yet. That's pretty intentional. I don't think that good relationships start with a list of kinks and thorough descriptions of how I want to bang you. I've been doing the casual thing for a fairly long time now, and I'm pretty ready to move forward to something more serious.\n\nWhat kind of serious? I enjoy D/s inside and outside the bedroom. Actually, moreso outside it in some ways - I'm fine with cuffs and paddles and spankings and all that. I enjoy inflicting pain in moderation. I've done consensual non-consent and enjoyed it thoroughly. I don't do blood play, bathroom play, or weapon play. My main enjoyment of D/s has always been outside of the bedroom though - the power imbalance in daily life is what really grabs me and focuses my attention.\n\nI'm not looking for something crazy hardcore - I'm closer to 50s housewife than 'I have a cage and you sleep in it when I'm pissed at you'. I enjoy free use (I.E. not needing your permission before we have sex), and light control of you outside the bedroom (I.E. you getting approval on your outfits from me, you checking with me before you make plans, that kind of thing). Essentially, I'd like a relationship where decision-making is split more 60/40 or 70/30 rather than 50/50. I'm a big fan of you asking me stuff rather than telling me stuff, and I'm a big fan of saying 'yes' to things.\n\nFor major life choices, I'm think you should be making your own. If our relationship developed to the point where major life decisions became 'us' decisions rather than 'you' decisions, I'd want that kind of thing to be 50/50. I'm not interested in deciding if you should quit your job or go to grad school or whatever. I'll probably have opinions, maybe even strong ones, but I don't want our D/s to extend to those. I think those should be either your choice, or a choice we make as a couple.\n\nI'm well past due to wrap this up, so - about you. I don't really have strong feelings about age (though much older than me might be a deal breaker? I'm legitimately not sure), I don't really care what you do, and I don't really care how much money you have (more or less, money's a tool, so I don't find it threatening). I guess if you have craploads of debt and no plan to deal with it, that might be an issue. I don't care if you're super outgoing, as long as you're cool with my pace being a bit slower - I'm never gonna be the kind of guy who is hyped to do social stuff seven days a week.\n\nWhat I do care about - the relationship style isn't really negotiable for me. That is, some amount of 24/7 needs to be a thing we're doing. The exact amount is flexible, but this isn't something I do purely for fun, it's something I really want as a permanent aspect of our relationship. I do care if you're super overweight - I'm not perfect, and you don't need to be either, but physical attraction isn't really optional for me. I enjoy feminine girls, but that's something that I'm fine working on as part of the D/s thing - I.E. you don't already need to own a closet full of dresses or be a youtube makeup tutorial star. I would really like it if you're passionate about something - I don't care what. Work, a hobby, knitting - whatever. The 'what' is way less important than the emotion behind it.\n\nFinally - local would be nice. \"Local\" being within 4 or 5 hours - so the Austin/Dallas/Houston/San Antonio range. I'm fine with driving, and as long as we can make a couple weekends a month work, that'd be fine with me for quite a while.\n\nWhew. I think we're done here. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"r4r","subreddit_id":"t5_2rn0e","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"29 [M4F] West Houston / Texas - Looking for a D/s relationship with light 24/7 elements","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/6qt7tk/29_m4f_west_houston_texas_looking_for_a_ds/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw"}

And I broke up with my first bf ever of 7 months. He's 24. Long story, but to keep things short, I'm a virgin and he wasn't. He began to pressure me, and he got mad at me because I didn't give oral\n back when he gave it to me (I told him I wasn't because I wasn't ready before he went down on me). After that, his demeanor changed. I wasn't going to break up right away as I wanted to talk things out. But he hung on me when I had asked him a question about honesty, and that was the last straw. Because of the pressure, dishonesty, and not caring anymore, I couldn't handle it. I gave him several chances. But I don't get it because he claimed how he loved me, how I made him happy..so I don't know why he acted like that. The only problem we had was my mom didn't want me to date him because she thought that he wasn't for me. But I made efforts to see him regardless of my mom. She now knows that we don't talk anymore, as she is a little surprised. Because this was my first time ever being in a relationship as I also have anxiety, I asked him a lot of important questions. He told me that I asked these questions repeatedly and how it was uncomfortable/annoying. I last saw him in June, and it's been 4 weeks NC. He last said that he'll distance himself from me so he won't hurt me anymore. This really hurt me because I thought he would at least fight for the relationship. Plus he was the only person I was close to these last seven months. I think about him almost everyday.\nTo make the heartbreak less, I removed off my Snapchat because I didn't want to see his stories. Although I deleted him, he still views mines. I made my story setting to private after the break up, and recently just made it public after about 4 weeks.

Right now I have about 10k in CC debt that I'm working through and about 80k in student loan debt (9 years of undergrad for 2 degrees and not a good enough paying job to show for it). I'm also 90% sure my parents didn't cosign any of it. \n\nMy employer offers 1x salary for life insurance (30k) but I also have a personal policy that I got since my previous job didn't offer any. The personal policy is ~320$ a year for 100k, which I know might be a little high but I'm 99% sure it's due to my weight. The nice thing, though, is it is a term policy until I'm 65. I got the policy as a way to cover the student loan debt, but since I'm pretty sure I don't have a cosigner I'm wondering if it is even necessary. \n\nShould I keep the policy as is, or ditch it and get one in the future should I truly require it? I could even get supplemental through my employer during open enrollment which may be cheaper overall.

I'm 31, which is right in the middle of the target age for our ministry, and I've known the rest of the leadership team for about a couple years, and they know me.  Over those past couple years I noticed that I was still something of an outsider to the group; many of them were in their own little clique, and I and perhaps a few others on the team weren't part of that.  Bless the priest in charge, I think he saw what was going on, since he emphasized at one meeting that we all need to work together not only as a work team but also all as friends, and suggested we do more all together as a group and be more inclusive.  I also drove home the point when it became clear during one activity when we were all asked what we were up to this past spring that I was the only one who had NOTHING to offer, that I especially needed to spend more time with the rest of them for them to get to know me.  After that I was invited over the past couple months to some things they were doing outside the auspices of this leadership group, just to hang out as \"friends\", and I was sure to attend anything I was invited to.  I had some hope that perhaps I wouldn't be FA.  Then I tried inviting some of them just out to coffee, or to meet up and have a burger, and each time maybe one person showed up or nobody came.\n\nNot to be too discouraged, I decided that I would invite the group over this Friday to my own place, since I'd been to most of theirs, and we'd have a meal and/or a game and movie night, ostensibly to celebrate the public launch of our revamped ministry on Thursday.  I sent the e-mail invitation out early this weekend asking for people to respond, text or call to RSVP (and added my number in the e-mail).  Three days later I haven't gotten a single response.  It's rather stressful to say the least, and it doesn't give me much confidence in the honesty of the rest of the group when they seem to enjoy my company.  I do work closely with them on this ministry, and some of them do know that this kind of thing is important to me, so I am rather unpleasantly surprised at this lack of response and concerned that it's going to impact my view of them and our ability to work together in the future.  I know they need me more than I need them in terms of working on the ministry, but they're the only \"friends\" I have, and it will really hurt to be stood up by between 10-20 people I have felt pretty close to like this.  But it's not like I've felt some \"friends\" were being fake with me before, it was a common occurrence through high school, not so much in college, but in college I could just ignore people like that.  Since then I've pretty much been FA except for a few months when I did have some close friends who I then ended up moving away from.  I don't want to lose this group either.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ForeverAlone","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3yz","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Still waiting on invitation RSVPs...","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/6qtbif/still_waiting_on_invitation_rsvps/","whitelist_status":"no_ads"}
