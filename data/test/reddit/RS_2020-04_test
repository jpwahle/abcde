I've started an intro post tons of times but never actually posted for multiple reasons from feeling like a whiney little bitch to anxiety. But I think this one will make it. Today I feel like a cartoon character who thought they were on solid ground and just looked down to see I'm on thin air over a canyon drop.\n\nI'm 29, my husband is 32, and our son is 1 1\/2. My husband and I work for the same company in different departments. I'm a remote worker and he works in HQ. We both had departmental meetings today and found out our company had a rather large layoff today. He and I are both still employed but his hours are going to be cut 20%. This is a company that, during the '08 recession, did everything in its power to keep from letting anyone go. My boss has been with our company his whole career (about 15-20 years) and said today was the hardest and worst day he's ever seen working here. Our company culture has always been focused on being a family, since we are family owned and I totally fell for that. I've been here for 4 years and my husband was hired on in June.\n\nI feel stupid, I was so naive and fell for the family atmosphere. I thought this would be my career.  This was my first job out of college. I started in entry-level customer service and worked up to a territory sales management position just last year. My new boss did the same thing about 12 years ago. It's still a new position for me and I felt a little lost in it before COVID, I feel completely inept now that we are working from home. But this still felt like a solid place to be in my career. The guy in my department that was let go had been with the company 38 years. I had planned my life around this. We rented a house and moved from our tiny apartment, I'm 10 weeks pregnant with baby #2. \n\nI know so many people have it so much worse right now. I know we both still have our jobs. But I feel like the rug was pulled from under my feet. I let myself believe in job stability and I should have known better. At the beginning of the year it felt like life was good. Now nothing feels safe. I don't know what else to say. My brain feels fried.

While the baby has been growing perfectly so far and showing no signs of abnormality, this pregnancy has put a severe strain on my mental health. I have had depression for a long time; I was previously on several types of medications that all followed the same path - they'd work until they didn't, my doctor would up the dosage periodically until I was taking as much as I was allowed, and I'd have to switch and start all over. Do you know how hard it is to adjust to antidepressants? God bless my husband for putting up with me. I stopped taking medication about a year and a half ago and started smoking marijuana instead, which drastically improved my ability to function. Obviously I quit the moment I found out I was pregnant, and I was okay for about a month. \n\nNow? I cry every night. I constantly contemplate suicide. I have no motivation to do even the simplest of tasks, not even those that would usually bring me some happiness. To say that this pregnancy has drained me would be a drastic understatement.\n\nOn to my point - my husband and I have agreed that we don't want another pregnancy. Ever. We were perfectly happy not having kids at all (didn't think I could conceive due to previous issues), but when that little blue line showed up we talked and decided to continue the pregnancy. This is a one-time deal that we both agree on. \n\nI'm worried that because I am only 23 with only one child at the time of surgery, no doctor will perform a tubal litigation or removal for me. I'm already dreading being asked questions about what would happen if I would change my mind, dreading hearing about how young I am and how much time there is for things to change, etc. I. Do. Not. Want. Another. Pregnancy. My husband does not want me to have to go through this again, either, because it's extremely hard. \n\nI know that I could go on traditional birth control, but I don't want to go that route if something else is available that doesn't rely on releasing tons of hormones into my body. I have never been on birth control and I do not want to start after giving birth. My concern is that my age and lack of multiple children will lead to me being dismissed, which is just shitty IMO. \n\nHas anyone else here dealt with this? What was your experience? Did your doctor listen to you? Were you dismissed? I am so lost. I can't do this again, and I don't feel like I should be put into a position where another pregnancy is a possibility because someone else has a different idea than I do of what a complete family is.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BabyBumps","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7cl","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BabyBumps","subreddit_subscribers":160511,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Young FTM considering tubal litigation or removal after giving birth - worried doctors will say no.","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BabyBumps\/comments\/fsoxnz\/young_ftm_considering_tubal_litigation_or_removal\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

The doctor decided to try doubling it, and after a few days I had extreme anxiety and my penis went completely numb for one day, along with a previously overactive libido suddenly being almost nonexistent. \n\nDoctor said I could cut back to 100 MG (I only mentioned the anxiety, not the sexual issues, because that\u2019s very embarrassing). I had a barely existent libido for 2 more weeks after that, and number orgasms than I\u2019ve always had (they\u2019ve never felt THAT great), but weirdly, they were also MUCH stronger, I just could barely feel the actual ejaculation\/orgasm.\n\nI seem to be maybe even better sexually than I was before (although still ejaculate less and more dribbling than shooting, but it still feels pretty good, and my penis sensitivity is pretty good.\n\nI\u2019m just still bummed that I\u2019m a virgin who\u2019s never had a girlfriend and this is very unlikely to change anytime soon.\n\nI\u2019m also scared of turning 26 and getting kicked off of my parents health insurance, even if I can get my own, all it takes is for me to be fired from a job to have it taken away, leading to cold turkey withdrawal, seriously risking long-term or even permanent sexual dysfunction, loss of pleasure, loss of emotion, impaired cognitive functioning, even loss of dreaming when I\u2019m asleep, which is the only escape I even have from this miserable life. I fully believe that SSRIs trap is inside of our own head, as they prevent us from even tripping on psychedelics, the brain can even be left permanently unable to react to any kind of drugs or alcohol. But the worst would be inability to feel pleasure, love, emotions.\n\nI sometimes feel like I deserve PSSD (as well as the loss of general pleasure and emotions) for being such a pathetic beta, even if it is somehow all the fault of drugs. Why should I even be allowed to have the capacity for sex if I can\u2019t efeb attract any women to have it with? Why should I be allowed to experience ANY kind of pleasure when I \u201chaven\u2019t worked hard enough\u201d and I\u2019m \u201can evil immoral liberal who thinks I\u2019m entitled to healthcare in the first place\u201d.\n\nWhat if I just pulled the plug on all of my pills NOW (MAYBE excluding the Bupropion, maybe). I\u2019m probably just going to get off soon anyway. And even if I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to be at the mercy of Big Pharma and employers to provide me healthcare, with the consequences of losing access being so severe and long-lasting.\n\nAbout 3 years ago, circumstances actually prevented me from getting a doctor to approve my refills, so I actually DID have to go cold turkey FOR 4 DAYS, and weirdly, I remember nothing happening from that, but I\u2019ve read withdraw can take longer than just a few days, or even weeks, to hit.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SSRIs","subreddit_id":"t5_2yhc1","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/SSRIs","subreddit_subscribers":3209,"subreddit_type":"restricted","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"What would most likely happen if I quit my medications cold turkey at this point?","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SSRIs\/comments\/fsp7tt\/what_would_most_likely_happen_if_i_quit_my\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I was going for personal training 4 times a week until they closed down the gyms. Since then I've been trying to stay active at home (walking and doing squats lots and lots of squats 100 every day..except weekends that's 200) I've lost 50lbs at this point however I need to lose much more. I still have facial and body hair however that can be removed pretty easily. At this point I've never been with a man however I'm hungry to get my chance.

I thought I would share a bit of my story. I'm 30, AMAB, pre everything,and I just started down this path. Still, it's been a roller coaster. Since I was a kid, I've hated my body, always covering it as much as possible, sometimes to the point of danger (heat). In games, I always played the female characters if possible, and had no issue, as I grew older, looking feminine. I've had an interest in jewelry (particularly rings, necklaces, and earrings) my whole life, and hygiene is very important to me. I remember crying for an hour when I started to grow stubble.\n\nAlso my entire life, I'd had a recurring dream, in which I was female. Usually, I would be doing simple, routine things. As I grew older, all of my more \"adult\" dreams featured me as the woman. Eventually, this became a nightly occurrence. I spoke with a trans friend of mine, as well as a female friend who knows a fair bit about interpreting dreams. Both said the same thing.  The chances were high that I was trans.\n\nIt took me a bit to accept it, but once I did, I went full-tilt. Dress shopping, nail polish, voice training, therapy. I've only made a bit of progress with my voice, but I've even gotten mascara and eye liner now (have yet to use them, but I have them). I've told all those who I consider the most important to me. I started using Reddit for the first time to learn more. I've even got an appointment with a doctor next week about HRT.\n\nEvery time I take a step towards being a woman, it makes me more and more happy, makes me feel more and more like my true self. Even the cuts of the razor when I shave my arms, legs, and chest are exhilarating. I don't \"pass\" yet, due to a weird thing with my hairline that means it grows in awkwardly, but I'm looking into that as well. For anyone who is struggling, I know it feels like the world is bleak. But focus on the little things. Baby steps. You'll get there. I hope I'll see you at the finish line.\n\n~Lizzie","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MtF","subreddit_id":"t5_2ub9j","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/MtF","subreddit_subscribers":76789,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"In Honor Of The Day...","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MtF\/comments\/fspc4f\/in_honor_of_the_day\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

I felt a need to rant a little. Sorry for some bad English here and there, and keep in mind that I was writing this very late.\n\nWhy is....this....so damn strange. The world. This space existence as we know it takes place in. When I was younger I was thinking about why there is something instead of nothing, but now I realize that everything is too f**king crazy, and that things are too wierd for our puny monkey brains to even slightly comprehend.\n\nWe are talking monkey aliens on a planet in space. Normal human reality is laughable. \nI get that the brain deludes itself. Its basically a meat computer that creates an illusion of an ego and a personal narrative. How can that thing possibly understand the reality it came from. But the human experience might as well be the true universe, because that's what it is for us. Things might make sense when I go about the everyday, going to school and talking with other people, but there are moments where the picture of normal reality shatters. \n\nI woke up today completely disoriented. I had been dreaming very intensely and vividly (though not completely lucidly). I have just recently started to remember my dreams, and they often blow my mind. Like what the hell is going on. Today's dream was in a familiar place but not quite the real place. I was semi-conscious, but not lucid, and I had completely forgotten who I was. When I woke up, the first thing I thought was that I had just woken up from ego-death. \n\nI am lost. I'm 17 year old, and my whole life I've had episodes where I struggle with existencial depression. I think I might be....smart. Trust me, it hurt to write that sentence. I sound like someone from r\/iamverysmart. I know about the Dunning Krueger effect, and I have driven myself crazy about my intelligence forever. \nI was always different (It hurt to write that one too haha, being different isn't very unique), I was already lying and manipulating people when I was leaving the kindergarten. I figured out what to say, what to do, how to act in order to achieve things. I was very isolated as a child\/young teen, I didn't relate to other people and frankly wasn't interested. (It certainly didn't help with my depression) I had no hope, and was rotting away inside my own mind. If I didn't have responsible adults raising me, I'm sure that I would have done bad things as a child. I honestly not sure if I'm sane, if the way I have experienced being a human is normal or not. You can't just ask your classmates if they considered murdering people as a kid. \nI'm pretty sure I don't have any mental disorders that could be triggered by psychedelics. I have been pretty obsessed with them this past year, and I have an inkling that this is a thing that can help me immensely.\n\nSorry for ranting, just had to get that out of my system.

There's just so much shit piling up in my life. There's so much stress in my life, I can't take it anymore. I guess I could list all the stuff that's bothering me:  \n\n\nEvery time at work (I do pizza delivery) I'm constantly counting the minutes till I can go home because the job is so stressful, I get yelled at a lot and customers can be so rude and I have ridiculous deadlines for everything. Two weeks ago I had a mental breakdown at work and I said I needed to go home because I had a cough. But my manager just screamed at me and said I should've just gotten tested for the coronavirus beforehand. He knew I was autistic and I couldn't handle that kind of sensory input but he said I should've never gotten this job if I can't handle it. I did go to the doctor's the next day and they concluded it was just a cough, but I wasn't tested for COVID19 because I didn't have all the symptoms. My job asked me to stay home for two weeks \"just in case\".  I saw him for the first time again and...well, things were awkward between us, we didn't talk much. The job has gotten more stressful because of this stupid fucking coronavirus, now we have to do all these special procedures. And my hours are getting cut, I used to have 20-35 hours a week, now I have less than 10. Oh and to top it all off, my parents charge me rent. If I loose this job, my parents might get mad at me.\n\nMy brain is constantly bombarded with intrusive thoughts and impulses. They're usually perverted, violent, or even racist sometimes. I'm none of those things and I know it's not \"me\". But it's starting to feel like me, like I'm about to snap at any moment. And afterwards, I feel guilty for even having those thoughts. Then my brain brings up all the stupid thing I did years ago: I screwed up a lot of ways when I was a young teenager because I was homeschooled and autistic, it wasn't really because of malicious intent, I was just...stupid. I totally lacked any social awareness. But my brain tries to make me out to be some sort of monster and that starts to feel real too...and I start thinking about killing myself because I deserve it, and that no one would love me if they knew how fucked up I was.\n\nAnd the worst thing is, I'm alone. I don't really talk about any of these things with my friends or family because I'm afraid how they'll respond.  I've had two suicide attempts before, and both times I did it my Dad became very angry and Mom became really overprotective. If I talk to them about my mental health issues they'll start worrying about me or get frustrated.  I hate being worried about since I'm 21 and I want to feel like an adult. I've never had a girlfriend either, even though I've always wanted one. I'm already socially awkward and lack confidence, and who would want to date the guy with mental health issues?\n\nI just feel like I'm about to loose it any second, especially in high-stress scenarios. I sorta just want to disappear, just be completely alone in the woods where I can't meet anyone so I can't fuck up and hurt them either. I've just made so many mistakes and I'm so fucked up in the head, I just don't think I'm really meant for this world.  \n\n\nThat's all I had to say, for now.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SuicideWatch","subreddit_id":"t5_2qpzs","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/SuicideWatch","subreddit_subscribers":197111,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I keep getting these waves of deep depression and I think about killing myself","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SuicideWatch\/comments\/fspkbg\/i_keep_getting_these_waves_of_deep_depression_and\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Just a quick background. If not needed please skip to the last paragraph as I need some answers. I am 20 years old, male, former lifter and avid crossfitter. Had asthma as a child but for some reason i grew out of it at a relatively young age, maybe 9 or 10. Sister was the same way. Bad asthma as a child and cleared up with age. \n\nBack in August I had a severe double collpased lung. (Bi-lateral pneumothorax) was told my right lung got down to the size of my fist and my left lung was pretty close. Luckily after a week and a half of being short of breath and severe chest pain my partner convinced me to go to the local clinic and get it checked. They did x-ray and sent me to ER. Was told if I went another week with it I would not have made it. Spent 19 days in 2 different hospitals going through 3 different chest tubes. I had 4 lung surgeries in that time which caused my asthma to return bad. (I was told it was completely normal) \n\nIt has been pretty manageable but as I have been working from home due to the covid-19 self isolation, I have noticed a severe increase in chest discomfort and short of breath. I have tried to look for every possibility and my doctor told me to check my house and room to see if there was anything in my room that could be triggering it and behind my bed I found what appears to be a black mold. \n\nSo my question is, is this a normal trigger for asthma? Its too late to call my pulmonologist and i am having severe anxiety with the virus going around. Any answers would be very helpful. \n\nThank you!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Asthma","subreddit_id":"t5_2s8vp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Asthma","subreddit_subscribers":11830,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Mold Question","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Asthma\/comments\/fspqsd\/mold_question\/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

I met this girl and we instantly clicked and we started dating pretty fast, but at the time we didn't care how fast we started dating and we genuinely enjoyed each other's company. The thing is that she wasn't necessarily allowed to date anyone. Her parents didn't want her dating until she had her future set. All was good until one day her sister ratted us out and she had to minimize how much we would be talking to each other. My toxic traits started showing up and I ended up revealing to her that I didn't trust her fully. I was insecure that because we were in a LDR and being so far from her she would find comfort in other guys. I told her how I felt because I always valued communication and clairvoyance with my S\/O's. I ended up bringing her down when I said I wouldn't. This was all during February going into this month and I realized all the mistakes I made and I confessed to wanting to fix myself and put things forward for our future together.\n\nIn the end though, it wasn't enough and I always kept overthinking that she would lose feelings for me and she did. Right now I'm being ghosted after pouring my heart out and I'm fearing the end of a whole relationship, not one that's romantic but even the small remote chance of us being friends as well. \n\nI know I did things extremely wrong, and probably extremely toxic but in the end I just want her to be happy. The Stay At Home Order in California doesn't make things any better and I feel so alone. I can't stop thinking about all the lies she might've told me to keep my mental straight.

I am 24, I have been apart of BDSM for about 8 years. Yeah I know I was young... I love it still, there are aspects of it that are hot and adventurous, and hell i love the control and power exchange. But I always realize that its another human being, they still have feelings, I still have feelings, so I feel like the things people like in the vanilla lifestyle should be present as well. I have lots of experience, I have ranged from a daddy dom to a master, I can be strict and sadistic or gentle and caring. But most of all I want to explore and try new things and need someone just as open to that as me\n\nYou:\n\nBeing completely honest, I am not looking for a specific type of sub. I am looking for a woman of any age, and of any experience. I do not mind if you are really experienced and want to teach me new things, or if you are really new and maybe even scared to try. All I am really looking for is someone to be open to exploring new things and be interested in more than just BDSM or sex.\n\nGeneral:\n\nIt is alot to ask for someone to dive right in and submit to me. I would like to earn your trust, be that person you talk to when something good happens or be the one you talk to when you're down. I want to be able to talk, and i mean talk about anything and everything, asking questions, being the devils advocate, debate, be interested in each other's hobbies, teach one another, explore our personalities, our pasts, and not just small talk\n\nMe:\n\nI am 5'11, lean, physically active, but I am a well rounded individual, I will try everything once and i am open minded. I enjoy the outdoors, sports, scenery and architectural wonders. I like video games and TV shows including anime. I work out and listen to music(mostly old stuff cause I find it easier to listen to stuff I know then decide whether I like the new stuff or not). I am the best at making dumb comments during movies that I think are funny, I am pretty easy going, and am super easy to talk to if you get the chance to know me.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you I have not lost you already, why not start a conversation with a little about yourself, or talk about something you enjoy? I hope to hear from you very special people. Please DO NOT be shy to reach out if you have any interest...oops I dont mean to yell.\n\nI dont bite and as they say, nothing ventured, nothing gained, as well as what have you got to lose? so why hesitate? just send a message and see where it goes!\n\nTLDR I am a great guy with experience but still have a lot to learn, so send a message, I promise it won't kill you\n\nP.S. If you play league, we can bond and play games together(other games too)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BDSMpersonals","subreddit_id":"t5_2smyd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BDSMpersonals","subreddit_subscribers":95933,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[26M4F\/T] #online Helping you live your best life .... through kink","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BDSMpersonals\/comments\/fspwys\/26m4ft_online_helping_you_live_your_best_life\/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}

I will try not to get too much into a rant but I want to give details where possible. My daughter is 17 months, I am 9 months pregnant. (40+1) \n\nDD has hit a hundred milestones at once. She's cutting at least four teeth (the eye teeth - she just finished cutting two molars on the bottom and she already had the front eight on the top and bottom. Can't get a good look at the top\/back to see if those molars are cutting but have definitely not come all the way through yet) \n\nWe thought she had a UTI and she is on antibiotics but I screwed up her urine sample so the result is unfortunately inconclusive and we are to finish the round of antibiotics to be certain. \n\nShe seems to be learning an absolute ton right now. She has been speaking since just before her first birthday but now she's really starting to catch on and is saying two word sentences like \"I that\" \"here go\" \"I do\" and that type of thing. She understands a lot it seems. Just today I was getting her bath ready and she was way too eager to get in so I tried to distract her but I didn't expect it to work. I said \"go get your cups!\" And she ran off immediately and grabbed two of her stacking cups, chucked them in the tub, ran off, grabbed two more, came back and continued until she had them all. \n\nShe has been throwing wicked tantrums, mostly for me. I think it's because I have physical (and I'll be honest - emotional) limitations right now. There are just so many things I can't do right now. That and all the stress about the real world right now is just really getting to me. \n\nMy husband has been great about it all but there is still only so much we can do and only so much that we know. I really want to work on communicating with my daughter. She seems to be understanding us way better than we realized - again today I realized just how much the word No sets her off and I've been trying to be conscious enough to communicate \"no\" a different way. I'm wondering if anyone can help us figure out how to understand her better? We've been trying to ask her questions when she seems like she's starting to get frustrated and that does help a bit. \n\nThe other issue which is my biggest concern right now is about her eating. She has suddenly become angry and fussy for meal times. She has a few dishes that we rotate when she's a bit picky but she's refusing even those. We've been able to get her to eat maybe two bites before she rejects it then we try something else. We rotated through 6 meal options today and she didn't eat much of anything. We ended up giving her a fruit and veggie pouch because we were just desperate to get her to eat. Today she ate a (healthy) muffin, yogurt, a banana, oatmeal and a fruit pouch. As well as a few bites of actual meal type food at lunch and dinner. We're concerned about A) enabling her behavior and B) her not getting enough to eat. \n\nShe's been really happy to go on walks, have a bath, play in her kitchen and read books but otherwise she seems just angry. With our second child being due any moment now we could really use some advice\/kind words\/encouragement. \n\nTL\/DR: very pregnant, fairly stressed about daughter's current mental leap, need suggestions about tantrums and picky eating in a 17 month old. Might as well throw in anything you've got about introducing a new baby to a 17 month old. Try to be positive, very overwhelmed with current events, my families health, grocery shopping and job security.

I got maybe a little too drunk, but I met this guy we can call Matt. Matt was a fair bit older than me, but definitely not old. He was 26. I was super into him. He was so attractive. He was tall (I'm 5'2, he's 6'3), muscular, rugged-looking, and was much bigger than me physically. We exchanged numbers and I essentially turned into his little slut.\n\nHe would sometimes pick me up from school during lunch hour to fuck my throat. He was an electrician and had one of those vans that didn't have any windows in the back, so I'd hop in his car, we would drive to another parking lot, and we'd get in the back of the van where I would often lay on my back and he'd straddle my head and just fuck my mouth until he came. Sometimes he would get me off too, but I kind of liked when he didn't. It made me feel like his toy.\n\nHe picked me up from school almost every day that he wasn't working. If I hadn't sucked his cock yet that day, I would then. But it was after school that he would fuck me and call me names such as a whore, slut, fuck toy, cum whore, etc. He loved spanking my pussy and would do it until my pussy was burning red. He would slap my face and choke me and gag me with his fingers to show me just how deep he wanted his cock to go. \n\nHe also loved seeing me swallow his cum. If he came in my pussy, he sometimes would wait for some of his cum to leak out of me, or he would finger me to get some out, and make me eat it from his hand. He told me I was lucky he was giving me his cum, so if it wasn't in my pussy, I should swallow it, otherwise it's a waste.\n\nOne time my parents went out of town on a holiday, but I still had school so I stayed behind. During that week, I stayed with him at his house. I woke up almost every day with his cock in my mouth or because of him pinching my nipples or clit as hard as he could. For my first year of university I went to the school that is local to my city, so he continued using me for another year. But I ended up transfering to a different school in my 2nd year, which is a few hours away from where I'm from. I'm in my 4th year now. He used to fuck me and use me when I visited in my 2nd and 3rd year, but he has a girlfriend now. Every partner I've had since him is too afraid to be rough with me, but I crave being fucked the way he fucked me. If he ever made me cry from the pain of him fucking me or abusing me, he would just keep going. I long for the day that someone fucks me like that again.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidslutsclub","subreddit_id":"t5_37wpv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/stupidslutsclub","subreddit_subscribers":234447,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My high school to uni slut story","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/stupidslutsclub\/comments\/fsq08u\/my_high_school_to_uni_slut_story\/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}

Hes my only real friend. I'm 25, Bill is 28. I've been grinding my ass off and will graduate college and start a good career this year. Bill only had 1 temporary job his whole life working with his step-daddy and now pretty much refuses to get an actual job for minimum wage. His mom bought him a new-ish car a few months ago with less than 20k miles on it because \"i cant work if i dont have a car\" which is total bullshit. Theres countless restaurants and bars and gas stations in bicycle distance. Hes had the car for months and he still isnt working and still has him mom pay for it plus insurance. He literally said \"im picky i dont want just any job working minimum wage. im not going to be a fucking janitor\" when he has no education, very little experience, and  This is how spoiled and delusional he is. He has his mom buy him beer every night from the gas station where she is a manager and he plays video games constantly and drinks every single night. Not to mention he somewhat bullied me when we were kids.\n\nI haven't bothered to see him for over 6 months because I can't respect someone like that enough to want to be around them. Its kinda just sad walking into his room, seeing what he does all day and having a blast doing it, smelly manchild room, long due for a haircut. We don't text much but when we do I just feel disgusted by him and sometimes we get in little text arguments that always leads to me basically telling him to get a job and him acting like I'm the devil for saying that. Well last time we texted he basically played victim super hard and said ive changed and hes done with me etc etc. and blocked me which is a first in the 17 years I've known him. Next day I blocked him on everything else except his phone number.\n\nI've waited years for him to wake up. It would be awesome if he decided to take control of his life. I'd love to have a friend to grow with and to encourage and motivate each other, but thats just not going to happen. I've tried motivating him so many times and telling him we need to move out together and we could take over the city, but he wont budge.\n\nMy main question is, should I go officially end this in person? Is that the RP thing to do? He lives 40 minutes away which isnt a huge deal. I know itll be a lot easier to get it done over text or a voicemail, but again I haven't even seen him in 6 months+ and barely talk anymore. But we were friends for 17+ years, and my pride is telling me the manly thing to do is tell him to his face.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the advice guys.

Of course I got back into smoking everyday and then right back to morning afternoon and night. All was well and I was back to smoking everyday until last night I woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat and puking and shaking. The only time this has ever happened to me is with weed withdrawals but I was smoking last night so idk how I would\u2019ve withdrew. I decided today though that I\u2019m gonna try and quit again. The only issue is that there is so much anxiety for me revolving around going to bed tonight because I\u2019m so scared of that happening again. I literally felt like I was dying.  I don\u2019t really know where I\u2019m going with this but thanks for listening to my ted talk and here goes night 1 again :\/","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"mentalhealth","subreddit_id":"t5_2qirg","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/mentalhealth","subreddit_subscribers":157977,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Day 1... again.

I try to find things to blame it on like astrology or some shit but I truly feel like I'm just not wanted anywhere. I feel like a burden.\n\nI grew up in a traditional family household and was considered the \"good\" child until I got to high school. My parents were super strict church goers, while I never liked the idea of religion bc it was hypocritical. I started acting out, sneaking out to see boys and friends, doing regular teenage things. But I did notice that I got punished a lot for it, whereas if my brother did the same thing, he wouldn't. We're latinos, so the male usually gets a lot of leniency and more love. When I lost my virginity, and they found out I smoked weed, my mom wouldn't talk to me for weeks. She wouldn't even dare tell my dad because I would've gotten beat. But with my brother, he told then casually in conversation that he smoked, etc, and all they said was \"don't do it again i guess\". I've always felt like a burden.  My dad is an older generation than my mom, so whenever I would get into arguments with him, my brother and family would say \"Do you want him to have a heart attack?\" But I'm super liberal where they are all conservative, so there was tons of disagreements in our house. And I wasn't one to let people walk all over me or disrespect me. Also, our parents used to beat us as punishment up until I turned 20. Not like slaps on the wrist type but like with a belt and metal hangers type. At one point my dad got really angry when I got home late (after my brother had been out until 3 am the night before) and my dad ended up choking me out and I couldn't breathe. After that they promised to never put their hands on me again. My mom has hit me occasionally since then. \n\nI've had depression since I was 10, and growing up I went through really bad friendships and relationships that only made it worse. I had 1 relationship in my life that was manipulative and mentally abusive, and it was 6 years until I developed the strength to leave. I just ended a friendship of 9 years because I was blamed for their mother dying, and I \"didn't notice that they were upset.\" Which I still don't understand because why couldn't they just tell me? I'm not as argumentative with my friends as I am with my family, so I took all the name calling and disrespect she threw at me. And we were in the middle of a trip in Los Angeles. She left me stranded in a city I didn't know and went back to an airbnb at 11 pm at night in an uber. And since I didn't have a working phone, I had to find a train station to find my way back home without directions. I got to the airbnb at 1 in the morning. This was recent.\n\nBut anyways as I said I live in a latino household and depression is \"something from the devil\" so no one ever took me seriously when I started to become suicidal, and to this day I've never received help (I'll admit  now that I'm an adult its my fault but I'm very scared of seeing a therapist). I started having anxiety when I moved out for college, and with it came anxiety &amp; panic attacks. My panic attacks got really bad that I had to move back in with my parents at 19. I'm 23 now and been living here since. My depression and anxiety has caused me to have lower grades, stop taking care of myself, lose motivation, and become super forgetful. I feel like no one cares, and clearly I'm to exhausted to do anything. Now that I'm older I can recognize toxic behaviors and now that my parents chilled out a little bit, I guess they understand the severity of depression, but I noticed they take it seriously in others than they do with me. It's not that I want to be coddled or get attention, because I'm not affectionate or attention seeking at all. But I just see the differences. My dad was diagnosed with depression, and my mom will come to us and say \"Hey please don't bother your dad he's not feeling well and having a bad day\", and I would think about how they never said that about me and instead yelled at me saying I'm sensitive and should get over it. My dad has a panic attack and he gets hugs. I have a panic attack and I'm told I'm crazy, need to see a therapist, or go to my room and stop acting insane. And I can see its all changed my behavior. I get insecure when someone tells me I'm awkward. I was always extremely shy but I used to be more outgoing growing up and now I'm scared to talk to anyone, super socially anxious. I spend a lot of days in my room by myself.\n\nI feel like teenage rebellion should be normal, and I can't comprehend why my parents would react so badly if they wanted to have kids. I think my parents thought I would be this perfect little princess, but I turned out the complete opposite. I remember hating shopping with my mom. She wanted to dress me up, and I just didn't like her style, I wanted my own. They'll blame me for the smallest inconveniences. I was forced to get my own phone because they would read my messages, and when I tried to keep a journal for venting purposes, they would read that too. My mom used to make me give her my social media passwords. And she would say \"you live in MY household\" or call me ungrateful, or say I didn't love her when I've never felt like that. She would say \"I don't owe you anything, but you owe me because I fed you, clothed you, gave you life etc etc\" But like what did you expect when you decided to have kids? I also don't know why they hit us because when I think of it, I could never hit something that came out of me. I've babysat so many kids, and not once did I have to hit or get angry with them for them to listen to me. I do resent my parents a lot. For this reason I'm traumatized and I don't want kids of my own. I get along more with my mom as an adult now. My dad, after all the beatings and stuff, I really just can't stand him. We can't go on trips together because we fight. He's retired now so It's worse because he's always home and bored.\n\nMy biggest issue is with my brother. We used to somewhat get along as kids, &amp; then when I got to high school I just .. we stopped talking. I always felt like he blamed me for my arguments with my parents but he never even wanted to hear my side of the stories. Sometimes I would have panic attacks and black out in the middle of arguments, but I think he just thought maybe I was insane. I would get him gifts and rides and clothes i guess to get him to talk to me, but it's never worked. I tried asking him about his life, but he's always cold with me. I tried so hard. We're only 11 months apart (I'm older). I feel really betrayed because whenever he would get in trouble I would always defend him, and I would get it 10x worse when I got involved. And when I got in trouble, he was never there. I feel like siblings are supposed to have each other. But even as kids, he would exclude me from our own cousins. I wouldn't talk whenever we visited our cousins in our home country because he would bully me with them. Or make fun of my spanish. They all love him. I get jealous a lot when I see my cousins get along with their siblings, or my friends talk about how they love their siblings, because I feel like I'm just my brother's roommate. For that reason I've always tried to find a sibling in all my friends, and get extremely hurt when it doesn't work out. I truly don't know what I did to make him hate me so much. And my mom will say \"No, he doesn't hate you.\" But I have a really good intuition. I've always known when someone doesn't vibe with me or like me at all. \n\nIdk if its something I'm doing. I always try to reflect on my behaviors to see if I'm doing wrong. I hurt a lot. I used to be more argumentative, and I had to be unless I wanted to be called names or get told off. but now I've given up and prefer to isolate. I don't know if I can handle it anymore. I've thought about transferring schools again. I wouldn't mind not talking to them any of them. But I don't want it to get to that point. Back then I wasn't ready to move out, but now I know that I am. I met friends through twitter that helped me realize that mental health is important, and that I deserve to feel frustrated instead of shaming me for it. But I still get the thoughts occasionally of just not being here anymore. Or what would it be like if I was just never born? I try not to cry as much. I hold a lot of it in. I'm not sure what to do. I really could go on, but this is all the simplified version. \n\n\nTL;DR: Everyone hates me and I'm slowly giving up. This turned into a vent post.\n\n\nedit 1: i wanted to add with my brother, he never shares things with me. he gets furious when I borrow his clothes, or when i ask to use his playstation when he's not around. but whenever he's asked me to use something from me like my laptop or car i've never complained. idk i feel like maybe its a small detail, but when you see other siblings behave differently, this stuff starts to bother me. he also has me blocked on all social media. \n\nedit 2: in my high school days, it wasn't really that bad. i only had sex with one guy and only smoked weed a few times. i never went to parties. i don't think it matters now because its a free world, but to latinxs its a huge deal. either way, my mom would always tell me \"why are you more like this person?\" so many times. &amp; even to my brother said a bunch of time \"don't be like your sister.\" those comments really hurt me.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"offmychest","subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/offmychest","subreddit_subscribers":1936464,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"i'm not sure what i did to my friends and family to make them hate me so much (23, F)","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/offmychest\/comments\/fsqbo8\/im_not_sure_what_i_did_to_my_friends_and_family\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I hope you're doing well during these crazy times. On a positive note - what better time to get to know each other? I hope this mini-interview helps you learn a little about me and maybe even entices you to reach out! \n\n**Who am I?** \\- I am 27 and I live in the great state of Texas. Before you ask, yes, I do have a slight accent. I do know my way around a farm but I no longer live in the country. You can normally find me at the dog park or doing something outdoors. I enjoy hiking, drinking outside on patios, and time spent by the lake. Don't be fooled, I have my nerdy side. I play a fair share of video games of all genres. I absolutely love series - GOT, Breaking Bad, The Wire, and on and on. I work full time and have a life outside of this dynamic. Appearance wise, I have an average body. Think dad-bod-ish. I am working out consistently to improve myself overall. I have blonde hair and blue eyes. I am a towering 5'7. \n\n**What I am looking for?** \\- I am seeking a dominant woman who would like to build a relationship based on open communication and trust. This relationship can be either as great friends or more if it reaches that point. I want to be able to confide our deepest and darkest secrets to one another and not bat an eye. I want to laugh together, vent about our day, and be able to talk about anything at all together. I want to care for you as a person and have you do the same for me. I am single and monogamous. I think it is obvious that I am seeking something longterm. I have no age preference other than 19+. I do not care about your body type, I am more interested in how well we connect emotionally. That being said, I will have to have some sort of physical attraction to you for this work. I am open to online and equally open to meeting up irl. I would like someone open to video chatting and voice chatting, there is only so much emotion that can be conveyed over text. Please be open to verifying once trust is established. \n\n**What does my experience consist of?** \\- I have had several partners online. I have yet to find the type of relationship I am after. I have read books and have been searching on &amp; off for a dynamic that works for me since high school.. I have a general knowledge of the BDSM world. I do not claim to be an expert but I don't think I fit the role of a true beginner very well. I do have a box of toys and various items acquired over the years. I have a good idea of what I like and don't like. That being said - I would like more than anything to learn and grow together. I am most to most new ideas and not easily scared off. I have a few interesting fetishes myself. \n\n**What can I offer?** \\- I feel I can offer a true meaningful relationship. I know that this is something I truly want and I am committed to finding a woman who I can truly serve. I am offering the ability to control most every aspect of my life without question. I am most interested in your pleasure. I want my submission and acts under it to truly bring you pleasure. If things go well overtime, I am open to the idea of an in real life FLR. I am honest, respectful of your time, and intelligent. I have my life together and I am not in search of anyone to fix me. \n\nI hope this ad gave you a general idea of me. If you would like to chat or have any questions whatsoever, please PM me to speak some more! Please tell me a little about yourself in the first message. I am hopeful to find someone to get to know and to get the laughs, submission, and fun times rolling! \n\nThank you for your time!

I know it'll get ugly when I'm married awhile and financially stable. Bf's mom said \"I want to be a grandma! You gotta give me at least one! Not now of course, y'all can take your time. But I want to die a grandma!\" Not looking forward to when she starts hearing the tick of my biological clock. Probably not even gonna tell her when I get sterilized. \n\nAnyway though, a bit of context: in my area sex ed is hard to come by and unplanned pregnancy is rampant. Most people don't start their families on purpose, they kinda just know they want kids at some point and when the first accident happens it's like \"whelp, now's the time to start a family and I'm starting it with the person that got me pregnant!\" So a lot of families are really toxic. Not a lot of thought goes into \"is this partner a good partner? Will they be a good parent? Do they even want kids? Do they want them sooner or later? How many? Will we agree on parenting styles?\" Lots of single moms, strings of boyfriends in and out of kids' lives, or dads that are unavailable physically and\/or emotionally because they just abandon all hopes and dreams and go into the oilfield to support their families. \n\nPeople are usually shocked I don't have kids. I couldn't understand the shock at first. In my head it was like, I work at a fast food joint for $8\/hr, I'm still not sure what to do with my life, live with my parents, not ready for marriage, why would I have kids? I had lunch with a friend I hadn't kept much contact with. I hadn't seen him in a year and he asked if I'd had a kid since we last talked. I was like uh, no. And he was like, \"I thought you would have gotten pregnant by now! I'm really surprised you didn't.\" I was like....wtf is that supposed to mean? I've never been overtly sexual and I've always tried to present myself as responsible and intelligent, I couldn't figure out why he would say that to me. \n\nI realized recently that when my boss was my age, she was already married with kids. I have another coworker who I met when she was 24 and I was younger, and she already had kids. I'm the oldest childfree woman at work. I realized that the shock isn't so much that I haven't had kids, but that I managed to not have unplanned kids.
