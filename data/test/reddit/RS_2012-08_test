I am responsible for at least $500/month on that, but right now there's no tenant, so I have to shell out $1200/month for that. \n\nAnyway, since my entire life blew up, I've been pretty nihilistic and spending like an insane person and I'm just here wanting to end that and get on track.

I don&amp;#39;t want to change the way he is because with all his flaws I love the man he is, he&amp;#39;s a good man, he just has to realize that I&amp;#39;m not as tough as he thinks I am, after all, even though I act cynical and almost like a guy; I&amp;#39;m still a sensitive girly girl when it comes to love.\nThanks everyone :&amp;#39;) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1343861452,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

Bear with me here! (tl;dr at the end)\n\n\nI'm a 28 yr old female who hasn't been in a relationship in 10 years. Before that, I'd had two boyfriends - 1 short term, 1 long term (by high school standards, about 10 months). \n\nI went through a really rough time right after high school, during which I gained ~100lbs. I lost all the weight within a few years but I truly feel like I destroyed my body. I'm a healthy weight now, but I've got stretch marks galore, my thighs/butt are riddled with cellulite and I'm jiggly all over.\n\n\nOver the last 10 years, I never made an effort with guys because I'm super shy, moderately awkward and suffer from the aforementioned body image issues. Recently I started seeing a guy I've liked for awhile and it's been going well. We've been out on a few dates and have another lined up. \n\nThe problem now is my body image issues are getting out of control. We haven't gone beyond kissing yet and I'd really like to take things further, but I'm terrified that he'll be grossed out by my body (because I am). \n\n\nAlso, I have a couple of tattoos which suddenly, out of nowhere, I'm feeling really anxious about. I'm passionate about tattoos, I like to think I plan mine out well and \"sleep on it\" for a long time before getting them to be absolutely sure, and I know I want more. He knows I have them so they clearly aren't a problem for him, but the crazy part of my brain won't let up.\n\nIt's extra crazy because I know a lot of my issues stem from the way women are commonly portrayed in the media, because I'm always comparing myself to the \"ideal\" body type. I know how damaging my way of thinking is, but I see girls with great bodies and skin everywhere and it kills me knowing that I completely screwed myself up all those years ago.\n\n\nI went back to school last year for a BA after spending years in the retail industry, struggling to find work in my field (I have a college diploma). Because I feel really good about my decision to return to school, I've come to terms with the fact that I'll receive my first university degree when I'm 32 and will likely be working in retail for the next few years, but it's not \"the norm\" for a girl my age and I feel like it's just another strike against me. \n\n\nMy close friends aren't particularly helpful, though I appreciate that they do what they can. None of them have ever struggled with their body on the scale I have and they're all in serious relationships, talking about houses, babies and marriage. I'm in no rush to get married, I don't want kids and home ownership isn't even on my radar because I want to be able to travel and move around after I graduate. I just want to be able to enjoy myself with this guy and be excited for what's to come, instead of doubting myself constantly and throwing up my walls to avoid being hurt.\n\n\nFor anyone who's read this far, I really hope that all made sense. If anyone has any insight, maybe someone who's gone through something similar, I would really like to hear it! Thank you in advance :)\n\n\n**tl;dr** - 28F, 10 year dry spell coming to an end, stirring up debilitating body image and self esteem issues.

Before that, I&amp;#39;d had two boyfriends - 1 short term, 1 long term (by high school standards, about 10 months). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went through a really rough time right after high school, during which I gained ~100lbs. I lost all the weight within a few years but I truly feel like I destroyed my body. I&amp;#39;m a healthy weight now, but I&amp;#39;ve got stretch marks galore, my thighs/butt are riddled with cellulite and I&amp;#39;m jiggly all over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 years, I never made an effort with guys because I&amp;#39;m super shy, moderately awkward and suffer from the aforementioned body image issues. Recently I started seeing a guy I&amp;#39;ve liked for awhile and it&amp;#39;s been going well. We&amp;#39;ve been out on a few dates and have another lined up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem now is my body image issues are getting out of control. We haven&amp;#39;t gone beyond kissing yet and I&amp;#39;d really like to take things further, but I&amp;#39;m terrified that he&amp;#39;ll be grossed out by my body (because I am). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I have a couple of tattoos which suddenly, out of nowhere, I&amp;#39;m feeling really anxious about. I&amp;#39;m passionate about tattoos, I like to think I plan mine out well and &amp;quot;sleep on it&amp;quot; for a long time before getting them to be absolutely sure, and I know I want more. He knows I have them so they clearly aren&amp;#39;t a problem for him, but the crazy part of my brain won&amp;#39;t let up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s extra crazy because I know a lot of my issues stem from the way women are commonly portrayed in the media, because I&amp;#39;m always comparing myself to the &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; body type. I know how damaging my way of thinking is, but I see girls with great bodies and skin everywhere and it kills me knowing that I completely screwed myself up all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went back to school last year for a BA after spending years in the retail industry, struggling to find work in my field (I have a college diploma). Because I feel really good about my decision to return to school, I&amp;#39;ve come to terms with the fact that I&amp;#39;ll receive my first university degree when I&amp;#39;m 32 and will likely be working in retail for the next few years, but it&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;the norm&amp;quot; for a girl my age and I feel like it&amp;#39;s just another strike against me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My close friends aren&amp;#39;t particularly helpful, though I appreciate that they do what they can. None of them have ever struggled with their body on the scale I have and they&amp;#39;re all in serious relationships, talking about houses, babies and marriage. I&amp;#39;m in no rush to get married, I don&amp;#39;t want kids and home ownership isn&amp;#39;t even on my radar because I want to be able to travel and move around after I graduate. I just want to be able to enjoy myself with this guy and be excited for what&amp;#39;s to come, instead of doubting myself constantly and throwing up my walls to avoid being hurt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For anyone who&amp;#39;s read this far, I really hope that all made sense.

Its comparable to a programming graduate having to use vbs  scripts all day every day. \n\nAnyways, the place has went to hell, they are understaffed and overworked. The manager has turned into some sort of metric loving monster and the enviornment has turned very stressful and hostile. It is not enjoyable, in the least.\n\nAs an example, I was tasked to replace/reimage devices in one of out campuses in a differant city, not really a problem except for the extra 50 miles a day. I did the math on the devices that I am expected to polish off in 15 work days, 274 devices minimum. After a bit more math, the best I can possibly do in a day with my current resources is 6/day, I will probably adverage 4 or so a day. To compound the problem I do not have badge access to my workplace, or any of the departments, eta 2-5 days. At max I will be able to get 90 device complete in 15 days, I notified my manager of this and was shutdown about it.\n\nThere are so many things wrong with this department it blows my mind. No documentation, no practices, no coordination, no cooperation.....etc\n\nTo make matters worse, I look like I'm 16, I have caregivers being skeptical and asking if I'm even out of highschool yet. Asking their coworkers if I look trustable right infront of me, talking down to me like I am just a little kid. Its demeaning and makes my job that much more difficult.\n\nThis place has changed, the pay isnt so good, there are no benifits, its going to hell, and its putting a ton of stress on me. Obviously I cannot quit, I need the job, but what can I do to make this better?

Its comparable to a programming graduate having to use vbs  scripts all day every day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the place has went to hell, they are understaffed and overworked. The manager has turned into some sort of metric loving monster and the enviornment has turned very stressful and hostile. It is not enjoyable, in the least.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an example, I was tasked to replace/reimage devices in one of out campuses in a differant city, not really a problem except for the extra 50 miles a day. I did the math on the devices that I am expected to polish off in 15 work days, 274 devices minimum. After a bit more math, the best I can possibly do in a day with my current resources is 6/day, I will probably adverage 4 or so a day. To compound the problem I do not have badge access to my workplace, or any of the departments, eta 2-5 days. At max I will be able to get 90 device complete in 15 days, I notified my manager of this and was shutdown about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are so many things wrong with this department it blows my mind. No documentation, no practices, no coordination, no cooperation.....etc&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, I look like I&amp;#39;m 16, I have caregivers being skeptical and asking if I&amp;#39;m even out of highschool yet. Asking their coworkers if I look trustable right infront of me, talking down to me like I am just a little kid. Its demeaning and makes my job that much more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This place has changed, the pay isnt so good, there are no benifits, its going to hell, and its putting a ton of stress on me. Obviously I cannot quit, I need the job, but what can I do to make this better? To improve my experiance? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need some help here reddit :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[Disclaimer: Please excuse any major spelling/grammer mistakes, I am on my phone typing this out during lunch]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1343855846,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

But I don't mind anyone giving a shot!\n\nAny other tips people could offer? Like specializing in champs. I've tried to not focus on playing any single role or small pool of champions but I've noticed that I do have better results in some roles and with some champions. Usually I do very well when I get to hard-counter-pick something but often I find myself bit lost when going top especially. \n\nBotlane:\n\nI have very high win ratios with almost all support champs (60%+) and have been doing very well in support role. I suppose this is mostly because general support players around this ELO are not very good and/or don't like playing support to begin with. I have lower winrates with the supports that don't scale really well outside of laning (taric, leona) but I remember snowballing botlanes like crazy in the games we won.\n\nI have on/off days when playing ad carry. I guess it has a lot to do with the lane matchup and my opponent's skill. I think I play really well in teamfights as an ad carry but my laning just sucks balls. I farm well but usually mess up when fighting in lane unless its faceroll lane or really poor bottom comp from our enemies. I'm 14-13 with Corki and 8-7 with Graves.\n\nSololanes: \n\nI enjoy playing mid but I have a hard time carrying games and I'm usually a bit at a loss in teamfights. I usually end up ~tying midlane and unless the enemies are doing a lot of dumb stuff I very likely don't help my team enough from playing mid. I still have ok winrate with Karthus (26-22) and I can play him comfortably vs almost all match-ups but aside from that I feel like I'm not very competent mid player. I'm also 8-6 with TF and I'm fairly comfortable with him, should maybe just pay more attention to being counter-picked.\n\nIn toplane I'm not even sure about my winratios. I have ok understanding on counterpicks and the mechanics of the toplane. But too often I find myself picking a champ I'm not very comfortable with or I have a matchup I don't know well or at all. I'm afraid of going to top vs jax or irelia, for instance. I can play Yorick very confidently, though(11-6). And I've had good games with Renekton too (6-2) but I'm not sure when I can pick Renek and when I can't.\n\nI'm 17-12 with Kennen too and play him mostly mid, sometimes top. I'm very careful about the matchup when going Kennen top.\n\nJungle: \n\nI feel very comfortable in Jungle too, and have 16-11 with Nocturne and 16-8 with Mundo, but only 9-9 with Nautilus. Those are my most played jungles. 8-10 with Lee but I haven't played Lee Sin in ages.\n\nI can spot a lot of mistakes the junglers on my side do when I'm not jungling and I close to never fall behind the enemy jungler when jungling. I might gank too little especially if my opponent is playing a very aggressive early ganker like Lee Sin or Alistar and this sometimes leads to my team losing very early because of my lack of presence. Occasionally my teammates also get really angry at me because of this (the blame the jungler-syndrome sometimes I guess.)

I knew before year 2 that I didn't want to marry her and that much of the relationship was based on lust not love. \n\nBefore we started dating we were seniors in high school and she was in a committed relationship with a douche since 10th grade. She was depressed a lot but didn't want to leave him because he'd \"been there\" for her during hard times. She would tell me things about her relationship such as \"all we do is fuck\"\"We have sex all over the place\". Although she didn't want to leave him she didn't feel bad for cheating on him and did so with me (sex) and I knew for sure she kissed other boys during her relationship with him. (I had assumed that since she was cheating on him with me that she didn't have any interest in anyone else which I was proven wrong about 8 months into our relationship when I read a journal entry)  I was also told that during our fling she wasn't having sex with her then bf at all.  Eventually I told her if she didn't break it off with him then I would find someone else. Charlotte didn't so I did. I dated a girl for about a week when Charlotte started to flirt with me again and tried to rekindle our fling. I told her no and that night she ended it with her douchebag bf. A week later my then gf ended it with me because Charlotte would always follow me places and my gf thought I was still with her on the side.\n\nI then proceeded to date Charlotte and for a while it was great, she was still depressed a lot, so I helped her look at her life differently and eventually we weened her off her depression meds. She wanted to spend every minute of everyday with me and for a while I was enthused because it would eventually lead to sex and I felt like I was really helping her. When we graduated High School we spent the entire summer together and when I started college she did not. She still needed me every minute of every day and would get upset if I didn't text her all the time.\nI made the time for her because I cared about her and wanted to make sure she didn't go back on meds because she was lonely. I told her a lot that I needed to focus on my schooling and that I would make time for her but it never seemed enough. I struggled that semester and eventually dropped my classes and took the following semester off. I told her the following fall that I was going back to school and that she should go too.\n\nBy this time I was pretty much convinced that I didn't see a future with her, but thought that if she got a job and started onto her career path that things would change and she would become more independent and I wouldn't feel like I needed to take care of her all the time. Which I hoped would make me want to stay in the relationship. \nShe gets enrolled into college and eventually gets a good job that relates well to her field of study before her first semester is over. Her job is about 30 mins away and so is her school, she doesn't have a car nor her license. So I make sure she gets to and from where ever she needs. She doesn't gain her independence and one evening when we were arguing over something I don't remember I told her I couldnt handle it and that our relationship was over. I went home and cried. Not because I was sad over losing her, but because I knew I had pretty much ruined her chances at finishing school and she would surely lose her job. I felt that there was no way she could move on in life and she would definetly go back on her medication and would spend all day at home crying. I was also very afraid her depression would eventually lead to taking her own life because I had heard her talk about how she used to try when we were in High school.\nAfter the second day I couldn't even look myself in the mirror I was so angry at myself. I went back over her house and consoled her and asked if she would take me back. Things went on as they did before, she needed me more and more, sex happened less and less to the low point of maybe once or twice a month. And yet we still spent every minute I wasn't working or at school, together.\n\nNow i think I am about as close to the present as I can get. We still do date things such as go out to dinner, go mini golfing etc. But I don't want to marry her, I still tell her I love her, but deep down I know its not the same way I used to and not the way she loves me. I know that one day I am going to leave her, I just tell myself I can hold off until she has her feet planted and me leaving her doesnt collapse her entire world shes created.\n\nSo I now ask upon you RA, is what I'm doing as terrible as I think it is? Is there a special place in hell for me?\n\n**Wayyyy TL;DR I've been dating a girl for over 3 years, relationship is doomed.

We can smile and chalk it up to irreconcilable differences, and go our own way. \n\nHere is a model separation agreement: \n\n1. Our two groups can equitably divide up the country by land mass, each taking a similar portion. That will be the difficult part, but I am sure our two sides can come to a friendly agreement. After that, it should be relatively easy. Our respective representatives can effortlessly divide other assets since both sides had such distinct and disparate tastes. \n\n2. We don't like redistributive taxes, so you can keep them.\n\n3. You are welcome to the liberal judges and the ACLU. \n\n4. Since you hate guns and war, we'll take our firearms, the cops, the NRA, and the military. \n\n5. We'll take the nasty, smelly oil industry and you can go with wind, solar, and bio-diesel. \n\n6. You can keep Oprah, Michael Moore, and Rosie O'Donnell. You are, however, responsible for finding a bio-diesel vehicle big enough to move all three of them. \n\n7. We'll keep capitalism, greedy corporations, pharmaceutical companies, Wal-Mart, and Wall Street. \n\n8. You can have your beloved lifelong welfare dwellers, food stamps, homeless homeboys, hippies, druggies, and illegal aliens. \n\n9. We'll keep the hot Alaskan hockey moms, greedy CEO's and rednecks. \n\n10. We'll keep the Bibles and give you NBC and Hollywood .\n\n11. You can make nice with Iran and Palestine and we'll retain the right to invade and hammer places that threaten us. \n\n12. You can have the peace-niks and war protesters. When our allies or our way of life are under assault, we'll help provide them security.\n\n13. We'll keep our Judeo-Christian values. \n\n14. You are welcome to Islam, Scientology, Humanism, political correctness, and Shirley McLain. You can also have the U.N., but we will no longer be paying the bill. \n\n15. We'll keep the SUVs, pickup trucks, and oversized luxury cars. You can take every Subaru station wagon you can find. \n\n16. You can give everyone healthcare if you can find any practicing doctors.. \n\n17. We'll continue to believe healthcare is an earned luxury and not a right. \n\n18. We'll keep \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" and \"The National Anthem.\" \n\n19. I'm sure you'll be happy to substitute \"Imagine,\" \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing,\" \"Kum Ba Ya,\" or \"We Are the World.\" \n\n20. We'll practice trickledown economics and you can continue to give trickle up poverty your best shot. \n\n21.
