I've convinced my wife that if we can sell her car, she will take my beloved Civic, and we will buy a CRX and end up on top financially we can do it!\n\nI like in Kansas City Missouri, and I've searched most of craigslist within a 10 hour drive of my house and I don't see much I like. I've seen a couple really good looking ones for a good price but they disappeared within a couple hours.\n\nI'm looking to only spend $1,500-$2,000 on the car. I know that's pretty low for what I want. But I've been pretty lucky with car so far, my current Civic I bought for $2,000 2 years ago, it looks great, and I've only needed to fix it once and it was a $80 part that I fixed myself. I either want one that is very sound mechanically but with some cosmetic issues, or one that is almost perfect cosmetically and needs some work. Either way this car needs to be semi reliable and drivable from day 1.\n\nThe issue I'm running into is all these cars have been lowered and swapped for larger engines. I want a CRX to get really good gas milage, not to race on a track. Also I really like the way they look. I understand if I get an HF with original engine I'm looking at 40mpg, but really I just want 33+ (not to get worse than my current Civic).\n\nI do realize it will be probably hard to find with an original engine that still runs good unless I want to spend very high dollar.\n\nSo do you have any advice? What should I look for when trying to buy the car? Mainly I'm just concerned that they have been ruined by kids who try to drag race in the car. My main goals is to get one with a straight frame and not needing to swap the engine, that seems slightly above my skill level.\n\nSorry this is so long, I ramble.\n\nEDIT: I just bought a '91 CRX HF yesterday and runs fine but needs some body work.

For the past 2.5 (nearing 3 in October) years, I have been renting below my means and working hard at starting my business (which I won&amp;#39;t go too much into). This is what has allowed me to build up my savings. I am a naturally frugal person, and am much more disciplined than most Americans with my money(the main exception being food/eating out/groceries). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have always dreamed of being a &amp;quot;business owner&amp;quot; (that was my childhood word for self-employed) and it feels great to be my own boss and to not have conformed to the parts of the &amp;quot;American dream&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t subscribe to (namely, a college education and a 9-5 job). My other long time wish has been home ownership.  One thing about renting that I do not like is the feeling that any improvements or alterations are at my cost and the landlords benefit (let alone the rent itself). I feel I would really love owning a my own place, and taking pride in caring for it. I also like real estate as an investment mode because it is fairly hands-free once the property is secured. Just sit on it and let it build equity,  while watching the market to sell at the RIGHT time. Overall I feel this is a lower-risk investment type, and it doubles as my housing. The third main benefit is that it would allow me more space to meal plan and keep leftovers (I currently have limited fridge/kitchen access). Plus, if I choose to re-locate I could just rent out the property. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know for sure I want to move out of the room I rent now. But, is this the right time in life for me to purchase? I prefer a Condo to a home because: 1) it has less maintenance, specifically the yard which I don&amp;#39;t have much use for anyway. 2) It will make me feel a bit more secure as there are many neighbors to keep an eye on me and usually they are in gated communities. 3) they come with some amenities (pool, bbq, gym). 4) I generally prefer a smaller spaces (or, as small as is functional and cozy) and do not believe that biggest is the best in this case. I have to clean and maintain the thing after all, so as small as possible! 5) The property tax will help lessen my tax burden...my 1099 last year was 80k and being single with no dependents and few deductions.....that hurt!!! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My main concerns are: 1) America&amp;#39;s economy fails and I have to hold onto the property longer than planned (3-5 years, or longer as a rental-income) and/or struggle to find tolerable tenets. 2) my job situation changes, or my desires change and I want to move out of this area, but am locked in to living in the property for 2 years due to FHA financing. (in this case, I could sell, if the market is right..which, who&amp;#39;s to say?)

I&amp;#39;m afraid because I know basically everything gives me a migraine. I hardly even like playing music anymore too which is one of my talents (and use to sooth the pain).

(If it matters, I'm 26/F and he's 33/M) He has known he has MS for about a year and a half. He has always been an emotional person (mood swings, takes everything way too personal, etc) but things are getting pretty bad. He has been taking things out on me and slowly it's getting worse. Bad day relating to symptoms, bad news from doctors or insurance...he takes the negative feelings out on me. By this, I mean he completely freaks out. He'll have me sit down with him and for at least an hour, he'll go over all of my personality flaws and what he says gets very cruel. A couple days ago, after one of these episodes, he went to the computer and asked if I wanted to look at wedding cake designs with him. (We're not even engaged) This behavior is all very hurtful.\n\nAbout a week ago, I was very depressed, told him my negative thoughts about life, which did not involve him. I needed him to comfort me. He completely flipped out and started screaming at me for having the audacity and selfishness to dare to bring any negativity to him. (His words...) After much screaming/hurtful words he violently grabbed me by my hair and thew me on the couch and yelled for another hour. This is the first and last time he has ever done anything remotely like this which is why I'm giving him another chance.\n\nThere are other little things that upset me, but everything adds up. He always has me help him prepare meals, which I have absolutely no problem with. But he'll have an attitude with me the entire time (think snobby teenager) and find things to nitpick/complain about.

He has always been an emotional person (mood swings, takes everything way too personal, etc) but things are getting pretty bad. He has been taking things out on me and slowly it&amp;#39;s getting worse. Bad day relating to symptoms, bad news from doctors or insurance...he takes the negative feelings out on me. By this, I mean he completely freaks out. He&amp;#39;ll have me sit down with him and for at least an hour, he&amp;#39;ll go over all of my personality flaws and what he says gets very cruel. A couple days ago, after one of these episodes, he went to the computer and asked if I wanted to look at wedding cake designs with him. (We&amp;#39;re not even engaged) This behavior is all very hurtful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a week ago, I was very depressed, told him my negative thoughts about life, which did not involve him. I needed him to comfort me. He completely flipped out and started screaming at me for having the audacity and selfishness to dare to bring any negativity to him. (His words...) After much screaming/hurtful words he violently grabbed me by my hair and thew me on the couch and yelled for another hour. This is the first and last time he has ever done anything remotely like this which is why I&amp;#39;m giving him another chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are other little things that upset me, but everything adds up. He always has me help him prepare meals, which I have absolutely no problem with.

We weren't a couple, not really, we just enjoyed each others company and got naked every once in a while which worked out quite well. Randy is 6'1\" and active duty in the military, I'm 6'2\", female and prior service myself. For those of you who don't know one of the first things they teach you in the military is how to drink and we were both pretty adept at handling our alcohol.\n\nNow this night was not a party night, Randy had to work in the morning and I was driving so it really was just a chill \"let's go for dinner and get a drink\" kind of night. We ended up having dinner fairly early in the evening and decided to stop for a drink before calling it a night at a dive bar a block away from the main gate of the Naval Base. Randy lived on base in the barracks and I had an apartment right down the hill so I agreed to drop him off before heading home since he's lazy and didn't want to walk. \n\nIt was a Friday night so the bar was crowded with enough people that getting up meant losing your seat and then you'd be stuck standing the whole night. I was sitting at the bar watching cops on the TV while Randy went out for a smoke, chatting and making friends with the guy sitting next to me. All in all it was ununeventful night. Randy and I split a pitcher of Irish Death (kind of like Guinness), smoked more than we should have and that was it. I closed my tab and we walked towards the back door and the parking lot. That's the last thing I remember....\n\nI woke up in a bathroom, or maybe \"blacked-in\" would be more appropriate since it wasn't like I was passed out on the floor or anything like that. It's like someone flipped a switch and suddenly I was standing naked in a bathroom, completely disoriented with no idea where I was or how I got there. I still felt dizzy, drunk even, like when you get deep in the cups and wake up still drunk in the morning instead of hungover. But that should have been wrong, I hadn't even had that much to drink. \n\nI opened the bathroom door to see a bit more about where I was. The room was dark and I could barely see 2 beds, one was covered in clothes and the other appeared to contain a body. Thankfully, the body turned out to be Randy. He was also naked and I wondered in we had slept together? Not that it would bother me if we had, since it was a regular occurance for us, but what bothered me was that I couldn't remember. I couldn't even remember if I had been sleeping in his bed or the other one.\n\nIt didn't really matter which bed I had been in, but it was cold in the room so I crawled in with him to sleep. His alarm went off a few hours later waking me, I still felt foggy and confused about our night and whay had happened. I woke Randy up in a panic so he could get to work and he asked for a ride to his ship since he was running late which was fine except when we got outside we couldn't find my car. I couldn't remember where I had parked, driving on base or talking to the gate guard. I couldn't even remember walking out of the bar. \n\nWe finally found my car two parking lots over backed perfectly in a stall all by itself (which never happens for me), Randy made it to work on time and I went home to pass out again. Later he texted me to find out if I remembered anything and to figure out what happend, he didn't remember much more than I did, but according to him I was the one driving when we left the bar. \n\nAnd that would have been the end of the story if Randy had been the only one to contact me that day.... around 9am I got a call from a blocked number.

I was pregnant in February when I was a sophomore and everyone at my school knew and now everyone hates me. Hardly anyone was there for me and I got an abortion with the help of my mom and she was pretty supportive but always told me bad things would happen if this ever reoccured. Also I didn&amp;#39;t know who the dad was. I promised myself that if this ever happened again I would kill myself and I just took two pregnancy tests that turned out positive and my mom CANNOT find out so the only appealing solution is to just end it all. My boyfriend and I used a condom every time and always checked to see if it broke so I&amp;#39;m pretty confused. \nHowever, the first time I was pregnant, it turned out to be a molar pregnancy (the fetus turned into a tumor instead of a baby) so I was technically never really pregnant.

Hardly anyone was there for me and I got an abortion with the help of my mom and she was pretty supportive but always told me bad things would happen if this ever reoccured. Also I didn't know who the dad was. I promised myself that if this ever happened again I would kill myself and I just took two pregnancy tests that turned out positive and my mom CANNOT find out so the only appealing solution is to just end it all. My boyfriend and I used a condom every time and always checked to see if it broke so I'm pretty confused. \nHowever, the first time I was pregnant, it turned out to be a molar pregnancy (the fetus turned into a tumor instead of a baby) so I was technically never really pregnant.

If do you prefer penetrating or being penetrated. Can you delve more into straight men and the attraction ( you talked sbout in Previous comment\\). Do you date men/women? If you date men when sexy time comes - do they blow you?  Sorry this is insanely fascinating.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbeotvn?context=5)|Yes I do.  I prefer being penetrated.  Straight men are the primary consumers of trans porn.  Gay men prefer their penises on men, not people that look like attractive women.  Several things contribute to why straight men are attracted to transwomen.  One is simply the taboo aspect, anything that is taboo has the potential to become a turn on.  Their is the risk aspect.  If they are discovered with a transwoman, their reputations could get ruined, they could get ridiculed, etc, and the act of risking big can be a turn on in itself.  Finally, transwomen cannot fake having an orgasm or enjoying themselves as simply as women can.  This visual cue, of a transwoman's erect penis while one penetrates her, or here clear ejaculate, are clear signs that she is enjoying what you are doing, whereas with a genetic woman there might always be that doubt in the back of one's mind that she is just faking very well.  I date both.  The men blow me sometimes though for actual dating, like my current relationship of a year, I prefer that they not touch it at all.  Save that for the genetic girls and femboi's, not my manly man.  That's a bit odd, I know.\n[That makes sense because I'm sure that a lot of those straight men may be closeted bisexuals. This might be a way for them to indulge in their fantasy without feeling, for a lack of a better term, gay.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbfa4jh?context=5)|I don't know if it's fair to call them bisexuals.  That would imply they harbor some attraction towards men, and one does not need to have any attraction towards men to have an attraction toward tgirls.  Think of it as 3 flavors of ice cream.  Just because you enjoy strawberry in addition to the standard vanilla doesn't mean you harbor secret desire for chocolate.  I'd say your take on it only accounts for less than 10 percent of guys into tgirls.  Transchicks are just hot in and of themselves.\n[As a trans woman myself, i am very curious how you deal with being called a shemale? i mean you linked to websites that use those terms. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbeoh35?context=5)|I have no problem with it.  I have felt pressure from the trans community to develop a problem with it, and I don't like that.\n[As another \"trans\" person who doesn't care about labels, I like you.

As for how often straight men whom know about my status show interest, extremely often, such that nearly every single one who knows me in real life  has at some point made a play for me.  My last group of friends before my current relationship consisted of 'white thugs'; pot dealers and small timers but all around 'hard men' with personas to protect.  70% made hard plays for me the moment they got me alone.

Cannot get or stay hard to stick it in manly butt.\n[This is kind of a multi-parter. Have you ever had sex where you do the penetrating? Could you compare an orgasm from regular male ejaculation to one like you described that is hands free from being penetrated? (As detailed as you care to make it :\\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbg33yq?context=5)|Yes I have, and have only been able to cum from penetrating 4 times in my life, and all were with women before I transitioned.  A regular male ejaculation feels like like an explosion where it's feeling pretty good all throughout, then all of sudden it's feeling really good, then out of this world good, then it's over and hyper sensitive.  A hands free orgasm from anal has a different build up.  At first it hurts.  It takes some time, for me at least, of working at it to get it in, and once its in, I need it to go in as deepest as it will go and just stay there without moving until the pain subsides and the anus stretches to accomodate it's new resident.  At that point, the penis and ass are one, at least for me, and it would hurt me more for them to pull out all the way abruptly then for them to stay inside, as he outer sphincter closes tighter around the slimmer base of the penis then any other part of the anus, almost like a cock ring around the base of his cock.  Which is one reason why guy's love anal so much, it's much tighter.  So once it's all the way in there and not hurting anymore, very short, shallow strokes, only removing an inch or two of penis at a time from it's new home are the way to go, and generally take a few minutes of slow motion for it stop hurting and start feeling good.  It's at that point that I can finally throw my head back and let the guy make love to me, as i'm not ready for fucking quite yet.  After a good 5 minutes, the motion can become quicker without hurting, and that's when the fucking can begin.  Approaching an orgasm this way feels like taking 2 steps foward on every inwards thrust, and 1 step back on every outward pull, very slowly edging toward the orgasm.  If graphed, the penetrating orgasm looks like an exponential curve, and the hand-free, pentrated orgasm looks like the graph y=2x, basically a straight line at a 45 degree angle.  The regular orgasm feels like it is fired out of you, whereas the hands free one feels like it is pushed out of you from within, with the period between the standard this feels good and the orgasm itself lasting much longer, and is able to be prolonged for as long as one wishes, similar to edging while masturbating, only hands free, so the pleasure is from slamming the prostate down on the penis head grinding against it.  When I am close to coming hands free or trying to push myself over the edge at last, my hips will start gyrating at a very high rate of speed, only moving a centimeter up and down and around, getting as much friction from his cock on my prostate as possible, similar to the speed at which you might expect rabbits or other members of the animal kingdom to copulate.   When the orgasm finally comes, it lasts longer, as if sounding throughout one's body as waves rather then a fire hydrant saying \"ahhh\".  \n[Interesting description of a hands-free orgasm!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbg4jhj?context=5)|Glad you liked it =)\n[Hi.

You get on top and take your time getting into it until it feels really good.  I suggest you be on top and his legs be bent at the knee so you can tuck your feet so they are touching his ass or even slightly under him.  You will need this leverage in order to gyrate quickly enough with his cock on your prostate to push you over the edge.  Use your hand to get yourself 70% of the way there, and then take your hand away, using only the feeling of him inside you to push you foward.  Keep doing this getting closer and closer alternating between your hand and just the feeling of him  inside you.  You should eventually get to the point where you can take your hand away at least a few seconds before you start to cum, and then just keep practicing until you can stretch out those few seconds.  My motion when I am getting close to cumming looks like I am just fucking myself on his dick back and forth, very minimal up and down motion, almost like my hole were a guys hand as he was beating himself off furiously quick right before he was about to come.  It definitely makes beds squeak!  Let me know if this works for you, and good luck!\n[What age did you start your transition?

Just be supportive.  Being transgender is completely different than being a homosexual.  Homosexuality is about sexual orientation, whereas transgenderism is about gender identity.  Basically very strong feelings of being the wrong gender are called gender dysphoria, and transgender people are people who experience such severe gender dysphoria that the best medical way to treat the resulting depression is for them to take hormones and transition to the other gender.

It's no wonder I'm so insanely devoted to him.  Our neighborhood is a bit ghetto and he is like the neighborhood superhero.  One night we were outside our building late at night just hanging out and a crack head started approaching our buidling so my boyfriend lights up his face with a flash light and asks what he wants.  Crack guy, who was white, says he is nephew of black lady in building that no longer lives there after being busted for selling drugs, so bf knows what he is here for, and tells him to keep walking.  Crack guy says \"I'm not afraid of you\", and bf says \"That's all I needed to hear\" and takes off running in his direction, which at 6'4'' and 250lbs, looks like a linebacker running at a kicker.  I have never seen a crackhead run so fast in my life, and my bf gave chase for several blocks before finally giving up realizing there was no way in hell he would catch him.  Another time I was letting the neighborhood kids play with our black lab while I observe from inside my apartment with my door wide open so the dog is always in view, as his retractable leash is tied around our doorknob.  Another obvious drug buyer goes to enter our building and our dog growls and sniffs at his crotch, leaving a tiny spot of drool on his pants.  Guy flips out and threatens to call animal control saying the dog bit him, starts threatening kids speaking up as witnesses saying the dog didn't bite, just sniffed, and I'm asking him if we can't work something out monetarily because I don't want my dog taken away.  Guy bites and asks how much, but I have no cash on hand so I say so but that we will pay.  Guy rages and starts dialing but kids distract him by arguing that if he would take money that he was not really bitten.  Get scared I'll lose my dog and run inside to wake sleeping boyfriend taking a nap between his day job and side work, and he runs out there and tells me to call the cops while he turns the table on this guy, as it's no longer him vs. kids and a transgirl.   Guy leaves before cops arrive, we tell our story with kids corroborating, bf looks like a hero, cops put out a bolo for guy for threatening kids.   Last story, kids are playing on a side street that ends in a dead end, car goes flying through intersection and unto dead end road, almost hitting kids if they had not gotten out of the way at the last second.

Speaking of porn, do you feel like the world could use some more realistic representations of trans people having sex in porn? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbgni0g?context=5)|Well thank you so much!  And it was my pleasure! Sounds like a plan, I hope you approve =) Google Alhena Adams and Lucky, when you do =) As for more realistic representation of trans people having sex in porn, I think that's a bit presumptive that the representations we already see are not genuine, when I would argue that they are.  That's definitely what sex with me is like, but then again I do the porn, so maybe I'm not the best person to gauge the difference between porn sex and non porn sex since It's the same for me whether camera's are running or not.  If you ever watch the video of Lucky and I, that was all 100% legit, everything I said is legit, we genuinely were ecstatic to get to have sex after our first attempt being interrupted by his grandfather bursting into the bathroom where we were in the shower trying to get him inside me after I got him off with a bj and he was still hard.  We met working on the front line at mcdonalds around the same time the company had approved me for my first hardcore scene and told me to start looking for someone to perform with as the guy they used for hardcores in my region had moved across the country, and the same day we met at work, I told him about the potential porn job and we ended up at his grandparents' house in his shower, and we didn't get an opportunity to fuck again until we were on camera getting paid for it.  It was like the camera wasn't even there once they called action.  So while I do get what you mean when you say more realistic representation of trans people having sex in general, I'd need to hear specifics about what you consider to be so unrealistic about their current portrayals to give you my honest opinion on the matter =) \n[Well, stimulation itself is not the only part of sex, and coming itself doesn't always mean it was fun, but enough being prudent, I get your point :\\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbgxm85?context=5)|Ah, I do see what you mean in that regard, that part throws me off a bit too, but I can forgive the producers for trying to cover all their bases in terms of what might appeal to their customer base.  There are some men that really want to suck cock but can't get over the idea of doing it to a man but can accept living the experience with a tgirl, and they might be the ones most likely to spend money on online porn for all we know =)  But I agree, I prefer when that's not the focus =)  There will never be any of that in my porn =).  \n[Mobile internet.

If do you prefer penetrating or being penetrated. Can you delve more into straight men and the attraction ( you talked sbout in Previous comment). Do you date men/women? If you date men when sexy time comes - do they blow you?  Sorry this is insanely fascinating.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Yes I do.  I prefer being penetrated.  Straight men are the primary consumers of trans porn.  Gay men prefer their penises on men, not people that look like attractive women.  Several things contribute to why straight men are attracted to transwomen.  One is simply the taboo aspect, anything that is taboo has the potential to become a turn on.  Their is the risk aspect.  If they are discovered with a transwoman, their reputations could get ruined, they could get ridiculed, etc, and the act of risking big can be a turn on in itself.  Finally, transwomen cannot fake having an orgasm or enjoying themselves as simply as women can.  This visual cue, of a transwoman&amp;#39;s erect penis while one penetrates her, or here clear ejaculate, are clear signs that she is enjoying what you are doing, whereas with a genetic woman there might always be that doubt in the back of one&amp;#39;s mind that she is just faking very well.  I date both.  The men blow me sometimes though for actual dating, like my current relationship of a year, I prefer that they not touch it at all.  Save that for the genetic girls and femboi&amp;#39;s, not my manly man.  That&amp;#39;s a bit odd, I know.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbfa4jh?context=5\"&gt;That makes sense because I&amp;#39;m sure that a lot of those straight men may be closeted bisexuals. This might be a way for them to indulge in their fantasy without feeling, for a lack of a better term, gay.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s fair to call them bisexuals.  That would imply they harbor some attraction towards men, and one does not need to have any attraction towards men to have an attraction toward tgirls.  Think of it as 3 flavors of ice cream.  Just because you enjoy strawberry in addition to the standard vanilla doesn&amp;#39;t mean you harbor secret desire for chocolate.  I&amp;#39;d say your take on it only accounts for less than 10 percent of guys into tgirls.  Transchicks are just hot in and of themselves.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbeoh35?context=5\"&gt;As a trans woman myself, i am very curious how you deal with being called a shemale? i mean you linked to websites that use those terms. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I have no problem with it.

If yes, would you be able to do a scene with a female? ( e.g. able to be erect throughout the scene)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Nope.  I still love women and have no problem getting/staying erect for them, though I can&amp;#39;t do so unless I am genuinely turned on by them, into the way they smell, etc.   I can only top guys that look very girlie/sissyfied/femboyish/emo-twinkish.  Cannot get or stay hard to stick it in manly butt.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbg33yq?context=5\"&gt;This is kind of a multi-parter. Have you ever had sex where you do the penetrating? Could you compare an orgasm from regular male ejaculation to one like you described that is hands free from being penetrated? (As detailed as you care to make it :)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Yes I have, and have only been able to cum from penetrating 4 times in my life, and all were with women before I transitioned.  A regular male ejaculation feels like like an explosion where it&amp;#39;s feeling pretty good all throughout, then all of sudden it&amp;#39;s feeling really good, then out of this world good, then it&amp;#39;s over and hyper sensitive.  A hands free orgasm from anal has a different build up.  At first it hurts.  It takes some time, for me at least, of working at it to get it in, and once its in, I need it to go in as deepest as it will go and just stay there without moving until the pain subsides and the anus stretches to accomodate it&amp;#39;s new resident.  At that point, the penis and ass are one, at least for me, and it would hurt me more for them to pull out all the way abruptly then for them to stay inside, as he outer sphincter closes tighter around the slimmer base of the penis then any other part of the anus, almost like a cock ring around the base of his cock.  Which is one reason why guy&amp;#39;s love anal so much, it&amp;#39;s much tighter.  So once it&amp;#39;s all the way in there and not hurting anymore, very short, shallow strokes, only removing an inch or two of penis at a time from it&amp;#39;s new home are the way to go, and generally take a few minutes of slow motion for it stop hurting and start feeling good.  It&amp;#39;s at that point that I can finally throw my head back and let the guy make love to me, as i&amp;#39;m not ready for fucking quite yet.  After a good 5 minutes, the motion can become quicker without hurting, and that&amp;#39;s when the fucking can begin.  Approaching an orgasm this way feels like taking 2 steps foward on every inwards thrust, and 1 step back on every outward pull, very slowly edging toward the orgasm.  If graphed, the penetrating orgasm looks like an exponential curve, and the hand-free, pentrated orgasm looks like the graph y=2x, basically a straight line at a 45 degree angle.  The regular orgasm feels like it is fired out of you, whereas the hands free one feels like it is pushed out of you from within, with the period between the standard this feels good and the orgasm itself lasting much longer, and is able to be prolonged for as long as one wishes, similar to edging while masturbating, only hands free, so the pleasure is from slamming the prostate down on the penis head grinding against it.  When I am close to coming hands free or trying to push myself over the edge at last, my hips will start gyrating at a very high rate of speed, only moving a centimeter up and down and around, getting as much friction from his cock on my prostate as possible, similar to the speed at which you might expect rabbits or other members of the animal kingdom to copulate.   When the orgasm finally comes, it lasts longer, as if sounding throughout one&amp;#39;s body as waves rather then a fire hydrant saying &amp;quot;ahhh&amp;quot;.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbg4jhj?context=5\"&gt;Interesting description of a hands-free orgasm!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Glad you liked it =)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbgvu19?context=5\"&gt;Hi. Friendly TS here. My boyfriend and I have been trying for a while now, but have been unable to get me there... any tips?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Sure!  You get on top and take your time getting into it until it feels really good.  I suggest you be on top and his legs be bent at the knee so you can tuck your feet so they are touching his ass or even slightly under him.  You will need this leverage in order to gyrate quickly enough with his cock on your prostate to push you over the edge.  Use your hand to get yourself 70% of the way there, and then take your hand away, using only the feeling of him inside you to push you foward.  Keep doing this getting closer and closer alternating between your hand and just the feeling of him  inside you.  You should eventually get to the point where you can take your hand away at least a few seconds before you start to cum, and then just keep practicing until you can stretch out those few seconds.  My motion when I am getting close to cumming looks like I am just fucking myself on his dick back and forth, very minimal up and down motion, almost like my hole were a guys hand as he was beating himself off furiously quick right before he was about to come.  It definitely makes beds squeak!  Let me know if this works for you, and good luck!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbgaoeq?context=5\"&gt;What age did you start your transition?

What advice can you share with me if I find myself in a predicament much like your parents were in?  I always have thoughts like &amp;quot;what if my son is homosexual?&amp;quot; and usually get pissed when I think about all the &amp;quot;gay hate&amp;quot; and disowning that occurs because it isn&amp;#39;t religiously accepted is completely unfair. My apologies about the slight rant, just something I feel strongly about. Would it still be considered homosexuality if someone wanted to undergo the change or is it something entirely different in and of itself?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Sure, pretty much every ethnicity I think.  Just be supportive.  Being transgender is completely different than being a homosexual.  Homosexuality is about sexual orientation, whereas transgenderism is about gender identity.  Basically very strong feelings of being the wrong gender are called gender dysphoria, and transgender people are people who experience such severe gender dysphoria that the best medical way to treat the resulting depression is for them to take hormones and transition to the other gender.  It&amp;#39;s ok to rant and ask questions, it&amp;#39;s cool that you care enough about your son to learn all you can, just in case. =)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbes4i8?context=5\"&gt;Has your work been to pay for surgery?

I find that most porn is a fantasy and I feel that porn involving trans-woman tends to be unrealistic because I have never met a trans-woman in reality that I have been attracted to.

You say trans-porn is unrealistic because you have not met trans-women that look like the ones in the porn in real life, well I assure you that we girls in the porn are real and people do get to sleep with us so I&amp;#39;d say it&amp;#39;s realistic for them.  Transwomen in general are rare, and ones hot enough to porn are like unicorns, so I don&amp;#39;t blame you for not believing in them =)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbf1phq?context=5\"&gt;I was referring to porn in general.

When did your transformation occur exactly? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5 years ago, though just bothered with the license thing in the last year.  In my state, all you need is a doctor&amp;#39;s signature on the forms stating you have undergone hormone therapy that has resulted in irreversible changes.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbfpxwq?context=5\"&gt;Have you seen that show called Orange Is The New Black?  Anyway, there&amp;#39;s this guy who is a trans (had the sex change) who is in the prison with the main character.  So it got me interested in how the state decides what jail/prison a trans goes to.  Apparently whatever private part you have is where you go. I guess it makes sense, but I couldn&amp;#39;t imagine identifying myself as one gender and having to be put in a cell with the opposite.  Do you identify as a woman completely? Do you ever consider a sex change?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I have not, but now I want to.   If I was put in male prison, men would kill each other over me.  I&amp;#39;d either belong to the alpha male of the most dominant gang, or be forced to spend all my time in solitary or under some form of hard core protection.  In all likelihood, I&amp;#39;d be prostituted by whomever won me.  It&amp;#39;s a scary thought, though I won&amp;#39;t lie and say that srictly as a fantasy, certain elements of that scenario turn me on.  That being said, I am certain I would be terrified if facing that situation in reality.  I do identify as a woman completely.  I have considered the sex change but would only go through with it if technology advanced enough to give me the real deal, as opposed to something that merely looks like it.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbfhdr8?context=5\"&gt;What&amp;#39;s the catalyst that allows you to legally be considered irreversible?  I&amp;#39;m assuming the tipping point is that you&amp;#39;re considered completely sterile.  Do you have to go through tests to prove that or is it just assumed?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Assumed after a year or so on hormones.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbfjtso?context=5\"&gt;Yay LGBT rights!

There are like 5 erotic stories in existence that properly capture whatever it is about that fantasy that turns me on, and my boyfriend served some time in the past and is the huge white guy you would picture being the head white guy if he was in prison (which he was back when he was, they called him boss man).  It&amp;#39;s no wonder I&amp;#39;m so insanely devoted to him.  Our neighborhood is a bit ghetto and he is like the neighborhood superhero.  One night we were outside our building late at night just hanging out and a crack head started approaching our buidling so my boyfriend lights up his face with a flash light and asks what he wants.  Crack guy, who was white, says he is nephew of black lady in building that no longer lives there after being busted for selling drugs, so bf knows what he is here for, and tells him to keep walking.  Crack guy says &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not afraid of you&amp;quot;, and bf says &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s all I needed to hear&amp;quot; and takes off running in his direction, which at 6&amp;#39;4&amp;#39;&amp;#39; and 250lbs, looks like a linebacker running at a kicker.  I have never seen a crackhead run so fast in my life, and my bf gave chase for several blocks before finally giving up realizing there was no way in hell he would catch him.  Another time I was letting the neighborhood kids play with our black lab while I observe from inside my apartment with my door wide open so the dog is always in view, as his retractable leash is tied around our doorknob.  Another obvious drug buyer goes to enter our building and our dog growls and sniffs at his crotch, leaving a tiny spot of drool on his pants.  Guy flips out and threatens to call animal control saying the dog bit him, starts threatening kids speaking up as witnesses saying the dog didn&amp;#39;t bite, just sniffed, and I&amp;#39;m asking him if we can&amp;#39;t work something out monetarily because I don&amp;#39;t want my dog taken away.  Guy bites and asks how much, but I have no cash on hand so I say so but that we will pay.  Guy rages and starts dialing but kids distract him by arguing that if he would take money that he was not really bitten.  Get scared I&amp;#39;ll lose my dog and run inside to wake sleeping boyfriend taking a nap between his day job and side work, and he runs out there and tells me to call the cops while he turns the table on this guy, as it&amp;#39;s no longer him vs. kids and a transgirl.   Guy leaves before cops arrive, we tell our story with kids corroborating, bf looks like a hero, cops put out a bolo for guy for threatening kids.   Last story, kids are playing on a side street that ends in a dead end, car goes flying through intersection and unto dead end road, almost hitting kids if they had not gotten out of the way at the last second.  Car can&amp;#39;t move without running over a kid, so boyfriend runs over to car, reaches in, and pulls keys out of the ignition, throwing them over the car at the kid&amp;#39;s mother who holds on to them until police arrive and arrest them both.  I got really fucking lucky =).&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbfu82h?context=5\"&gt;The show is great.

My favorite thing to tell him when he brings home his paycheck and gives it to me to manage our money or brings home bags full of groceries of everything I like is that &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re the best daddy in the world&amp;quot;, and I am so very grateful for all of it, so thank you for giving me even more to appreciate him for by providing me with the knowledge that I&amp;#39;m not the only one that would do so =)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbfq36g?context=5\"&gt;I&amp;#39;m personally a Libertarian and believe people should pursue their own happiness. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;That&amp;#39;s very cool, I&amp;#39;ll have to educate myself a bit more about Libertarianism.

Hmmm.  I&amp;#39;ll let you know if I think of any more, haha.  For porn, travelling to NYC for a shoot was fun, I stayed with a sister tgirl in the bronx the 2 days I was in town, which felt pretty cool.  She was into diaper play and initially it seemed silly to me but I could tell my poking fun at the predilection was not winning me any favors so I decided to suspend my misgivings and give it a try and let her diaper me.  It was a lot more fun than I expected, and peeing into a diaper when it is kinda chilly outside actually feels really nice =)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbgnaju?context=5\"&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to try diapers one day, it sounds like a lot of fun &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I recommend it!

I&amp;#39;ll try to keep you in mind and check out some of your porn when my internet comes back :p.  Speaking of porn, do you feel like the world could use some more realistic representations of trans people having sex in porn? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Well thank you so much!  And it was my pleasure! Sounds like a plan, I hope you approve =) Google Alhena Adams and Lucky, when you do =) As for more realistic representation of trans people having sex in porn, I think that&amp;#39;s a bit presumptive that the representations we already see are not genuine, when I would argue that they are.  That&amp;#39;s definitely what sex with me is like, but then again I do the porn, so maybe I&amp;#39;m not the best person to gauge the difference between porn sex and non porn sex since It&amp;#39;s the same for me whether camera&amp;#39;s are running or not.  If you ever watch the video of Lucky and I, that was all 100% legit, everything I said is legit, we genuinely were ecstatic to get to have sex after our first attempt being interrupted by his grandfather bursting into the bathroom where we were in the shower trying to get him inside me after I got him off with a bj and he was still hard.  We met working on the front line at mcdonalds around the same time the company had approved me for my first hardcore scene and told me to start looking for someone to perform with as the guy they used for hardcores in my region had moved across the country, and the same day we met at work, I told him about the potential porn job and we ended up at his grandparents&amp;#39; house in his shower, and we didn&amp;#39;t get an opportunity to fuck again until we were on camera getting paid for it.  It was like the camera wasn&amp;#39;t even there once they called action.  So while I do get what you mean when you say more realistic representation of trans people having sex in general, I&amp;#39;d need to hear specifics about what you consider to be so unrealistic about their current portrayals to give you my honest opinion on the matter =)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbgxm85?context=5\"&gt;Well, stimulation itself is not the only part of sex, and coming itself doesn&amp;#39;t always mean it was fun, but enough being prudent, I get your point :)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Ah, I do see what you mean in that regard, that part throws me off a bit too, but I can forgive the producers for trying to cover all their bases in terms of what might appeal to their customer base.  There are some men that really want to suck cock but can&amp;#39;t get over the idea of doing it to a man but can accept living the experience with a tgirl, and they might be the ones most likely to spend money on online porn for all we know =)  But I agree, I prefer when that&amp;#39;s not the focus =)  There will never be any of that in my porn =).&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jhdaw/iama_transgender_woman_adult_film_actress_ama_nsfw/cbh8sz5?context=5\"&gt;Mobile internet.

I can't imagine that they could be, based on my own experiences. Before I get accused of being ugly or not able to get any I should describe myself: I'm 25, white, in good shape (I lift weights, do cardio, etc., have a nice body), tan, and my face is good enough that I constantly get hit on by both women and men when I go out. I'm masculine and don't give off any hint of effeminacy, to the point where sometimes girls don't believe I'm gay when I tell them.\n\nThat said, it's impossible, and I mean IMPOSSIBLE to be sexually satisfied. The reason is this, I'm attracted to young, muscular, good looking and importantly, MANLY guys. I mean, so are we all, right? Sounds straightforward. But if you admit that, I can't see how you're sexually satisfied as a gay man. Unfortunately the stereotypes are true and I've almost never met a gay guy who wasn't in some way effeminate or \"soft.\" Masculine gays do exist, but are so rare that often they don't fit my other requirements of being young, handsome, etc.; and let's say there is someone who fits all of this, they must exist in such small numbers that at least personally I've never met one in years of looking. And I mean looking online as well as in bars and going out. They just don't exist. The main problem is the lack of masculinity part; I'd say it's a super-minority of gay men who are actually masculine. Often I meet a guy who describes himself as such, only to find out that the description itself only made sense \"relative to other gays,\" but that they're not actually masculine and you can scope them out in a few seconds. I know, you can accuse me of being the same: I will disagree, but even if I grant you that, it changes nothing. I have effeminate gay friends, they're great people, I have nothing against them; they agree with me, and have the same problem. They'd love to hook up with and serve a masculine, handsome strong young guy, and they can't find one.\n\nThis leaves me with very few options. The men who fit the profile of what I'm looking for are straight, almost without exception. Going after straight dudes though is difficult. Not impossible, because you can convince almost anyone to experiment a couple of times. But that route is very difficult; even if you play all your cards right and befriend the straight guy and seduce him slowly and have him try it out, he won't do so more than a few times. That is if he does at all, because even if you do everything right you will only succeed in a minority of cases.\n\nThe other option is to pay straight guys, and this is the route I've taken. Unfortunately this is harder than it sounds. In the US and Europe guys are not in that bad economic shape for them to agree to do this. Maybe they would for an obscene amount of money, which I don't have, but they won't let you suck them off for a few hundred dollars. Not white guys at least, which is what I prefer; if I liked black guys, that's quite easy to pull off in the US, because of various cultural and other reasons straight black guys are just more willing to take money to let you suck them off, but unfortunately I'm not attracted to black guys. The only option I have really is to go to Brazil, where there is a combination of extreme poverty (daily salary for working class guys is like $20/day for hard labor) and also a culture that is more \"open minded\" in the sense that it's not considered \"gay\" if you're on top. Even there it's not very easy, but if you're willing to pay enough you can find a very handsome, muscular, manly, etc., guy who will let you suck them off or who will fuck you.\n\nAnyway aside from that, what options do you have? I'd like to hear from others here, although I don't really expect honest answers, you guys have an online reputation to manage or something. But this has been my experience, and that of other gay guys I know who have been close enough to me to admit that they have the same problem.","link_flair_text":null,"author":"narcissus88","downs":0,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1jiuug/are_you_sexually_satisfied_im_not/","report_reasons":null,"thumbnail":"self","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m wondering if other gay guys are sexually satisfied.

{"domain":"self.Paranormal","link_flair_text":null,"selftext":"This is a repost, I'll just go ahead and tell you. The thing is, I created the original, and im reposting here because r/nosleep just trolled me. Plus, I believe its more fitting in a paranormal community rather than \"spooky story\" because this legit happened to me and my family. We've never really told anyone, I've told maybe 3 people in my life.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I didn't have friends. I had brothers and cousins. We spent all of our time roaming the woods. We lived in a fairly secluded hollow in a southern state, so the majority of our time was spent running through the woods, swinging on vines and shit. Real country boy activities. I remember only bits and pieces of this, because I was 3-4 when it started, but what I clearly remember is waking up one night to the sound of my own voice. I thought \"I'm not talking?!?\" and then I looked in the corner of the room. There I saw a little boy, my size, huddled in the corner rubbing his arms as if he were cold. I don't believe I said anything, but he looked over at me, ran towards the window, and leaped through it. Now, You would expect the glass to shatter and it be this loud bang, but nothing happened. I began to get scared and started crying and screaming. My mom runs up the stairs to check on me. Turns out I just had a \"bad dream.\" or atleast that what she came too. Well, for the next few days, I felt like someone was following me, and I kept catching this little motherfucker peeking at me from behind walls and shit. Those are the memories I have at that house, because shortly after I told my mom what all was happening, we fucking dipped out and moved. Apparently, I had been told several strange things by this \"little kid\" and I would go tell my mom. Things like \"Tomorrow a snake is going to crawl in the cabinet, you need to close the hole up.\" My mom would laugh it off, and sure as shit a snake would be in there the next day. She told me later in life the reason we moved is she woke up in the middle of the night to me sitting on the couch talking plainly to someone who wasnt there. I dont remember it, but she said I just kept saying \"I'll be your friend if you leave them alone. I love them. Don't bother them.\" and when she said something to me, I turned my head... stared directly at her.. and smiled. She told me that when I smiled, she heard ,as she put it, a \"god awful\" roar that shook the room, then a blast of air hit her, knocked her down. She said the worst part was when I jumped off the couch and screamed \"YOU PROMISED YOU WOULDNT DO THAT. YOU NEED TO GO AWAY... GO AWAY BAD MAN... GO AWAY\" Remember, This part I have no memory of, and I to the day remain skeptical of this shit... but it keeps going... My mom apparently had some big deal where she went into my room and strongly told whatever it was that it wasnt welcome and had to go........ She never told me what happened next, but a week later we had a new home. I liked this home. It had a bunch of race cars and shit on the wall... a real knock out place for a 4-5 year old kid. Everything returned to normal. My brother went to live with our biological mother (I lived with my grandparents.. they adopted me because my mother said she didnt want me... they saved me from abortion) so it was just me in the home with my mom and dad. I had started a preschool literally a quarter of a mile from my home because my mom started working to help pay for our new home. Then... shit got wierd again. I was a preschool one day when a teacher called my mom going bat shit crazy... Apparently I told the woman that \"Susie said she loved you, and that her shoes that she loved were lost in the water.\" That might not seem like much, but susie was her sister who was kidnapped raped and dumped into the river. That lady never got onto me or anything after that... She always would stare me down and make me nap alone... Then the shit started happening at home. This time, my parents thought it was just a kid having and imaginary friend. This is were shit gets strange for me, because I can remember most of this. I'll indicate when i cant. I was 5, and had been preoccupied with my imaginary friend Uncle Daniel. My mom thought I was terrible at giving imaginary names, and that being my name is Daniel, I just projected it from my imagination. Anywho, I had become best buds with Uncle Daniel. I can never remember seeing what uncle daniel looked like, but I remember the voice. I would play with toys in my toyroom, and that homie was right beside me! Cowboys and indians and shit ya know? Then one day, he told me to go tell me mom that when we went to the beach next week, that we needed to take the VCR (kids, this was before DVD) because the television was broke and if we wanted to watch anything, we would need it. She laughed it off and just went on with business as usual. This hadn't been the first time Uncle Daniel had told me to tell her things... Usually I wouldnt and he would be angry with me. This time I did, and when we went into our condo at the beach, My mom turned pale. -I dont remember this part I am about to tell you, this is from my mothers mouth.- She grabbed and started shaking me saying \"Who told you that... who told you that\" she said I went completely blank faced and said to her \"MARY (moms Name) TAKE YOU HANDS OFF OF THE BOY\" and pushed her back with force. She said she started crying, and we left the beach after being there only 3-4 hours. She told me she couldnt look at me. We went home. My mom was wierd around me for the next couple of days. She wouldnt really look at me when talking to me, and had been calling about getting me evaluated by therapists (sp.) She said she didnt even have the chance to set up an appointment before things went CRAY CRAY. She said she woke up one night, and there I was on the couch again, talking just plain as day to someone she couldnt see. -No memory of this- she said she was apprehensive about saying anything to me, but she listened for a while. I was argueing with my imaginary friend Uncle Daniel. Apparently, he and I didnt see eye to eye with something he was gonna do, and I was basically breaking up with him. She said I told him I didnt want to see him anymore, and that he needed to go back. She said she had no idea what I meant by go back, but I stood up on my feet and started screaming \"GO BACK GO BACK GO BACK\" and thats when 2 pictures fell off the all, she heard HEAVY footsteps in the kitchen, and the door opened by itself. She said she spent the next 30 mins crying until I walked up to her and told her it was ok, and he was gone and she shouldnt be sad anymore. Wierd right? Well, He didnt go away. I remember this clearly, i was laying in bed with my dad one night because he had been particularly nasty to me that day and I didnt want to be alone... I all the sudden felt something tugging on my shirt, and when I turned, nothing was there. The bed we were in was up against the all, so there was a tiny crack between the wall and bed. I felt fingers... I to the day can remember each finger grabbing my side and pulling my shirt under the bed. I started screaming.. my dad hops up and asks me whats wrong... I tell him, and he instantly drops to the floor and looks under the bed... Nothing. At this point, my mom burst in from the other room and is freaking out. Now, This part gives me chillbumps still, and I'll try to explain completely. My parents have different versions of what happened, but ill give both. My dad, A non religious man who just believed I was being a kid, said to me later in life that he was looking at me, but suddenly I didnt look like myself anymore. I had changed and he couldnt figure it out. He said he asked me \"Are you ok.\" and thats when I supposedly told him \"The boy is my friend. I'm not going to hurt him.\" My dad said that it was in such a creepy voice that he fucking booked it out of the room. Each door he would go to would shut in front of him as if someone was slamming them shut. Then he said it just got calm again. He said he didnt sleep that night, but shrugged it off the next day after talking to co workers. My moms version of the story is different. She said that she felt someone holding her hand, and when she looked, I was standing beside her, but I was also on the bed. She said that the \"version\" of me on the bed looked contorted. She said she had an overwelming sense that things were ok, and that she looked at the \"Version\" on me holding her hand and said \"Please, He is a good boy, just leave him alone. You are scaring him all the time now.\" She said that somehow, The me on the bed looked normal, and the thing holding her hand howled and dissappeared. When I woke up the next day, Uncle Daniel was gone... And I didnt see him again until a few years later. The next couple of years were simple... I didnt have any sort of scary shit happen other than watching scary movies and being afraid of the dark. The next couple of weird things are actually comforting to me. My sister passed away when i was 8 years old. My mom had received a call from a Colordo police department and she was on the toilet seat crying (no she wasnt shitting or pissing.. she just broke down and had been folding towels) She said she walking in my room to wake me up, but say me sitting on the bed talking to someone. She tells me that I was giggling and saying \"So I wont see you again? Sissy dont go?\" I believe you should know, I called my sister sissy. My mom said she saw an impression on the bed next to me that lifted when she came in... She broke down. I apparently kept telling her \"But no, sissy is here. Sissy is here\" Weird I know. but this HAPPENED. I turn 10. A few months later my grandfather and grandmother pass away. It was about 3 months apart. I had a dream they were on their couch. They told me to tell everyone they were ok... So I did... this oddly brought peace to my entire family... but I was just a kid. So, remember Uncle Daniel? Well, I am 10 years old and my family decides to go on a road trip to las vegas... its a long ass drive, and it took us three days. One night, We were in Arizona and the while we were asleep, the water faucent turned on in the bathroom. I went and turned it off being the only one awake. I lay down... it cuts back on. I walk in there, and cut it off again, irriated because I was tired. (I rememeber all of this) I went to go lay back down, And there was Uncle Daniel, sitting in a chair next to our bed. I SCREAMED, and my mom woke up. She said I was shaking, and she knew what I had seen. she said some shit like \"Begone foul spirit... i told you to leave him alone\" or something like that and he just disappeared... We left immediately.\n\nSo, Thats pretty much sums up my story. I know there it will be met with a lot of reddit skeptisim, but I promise you, these things happened. I never had any experiences after this other than things you can chaulk up to coincidence (basically being able to call when someone was going to get hurt, something would go wrong, or an accident would happen) I have never told any of my friends, they all wouldnt believe me anyhow. I did tell 2 different girlfriends that were pretty serious, and my mother backed me up. They somehow felt closer to me after hearing these stories. I would expect that they would turn tail and run. Anyhow, I guess the reason I am posting this is to see if anyone has had similar experiences, Or maybe when they were a child this happened. I'm not some freak of nature, and I'm a normal contributing member of society. Still, sometimes when I dream, Im talking to people I shouldnt be...\n","downs":0,"author":"[deleted]","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1jiseq/childhood_experiences/","report_reasons":null,"thumbnail":"self","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a repost, I&amp;#39;ll just go ahead and tell you.

This is completely real. (I touched on it in another thread)\n\nWhen I was a kid, I didn't have friends. I had brothers and cousins. We spent all of our time roaming the woods. We lived in a fairly secluded hollow in a southern state, so the majority of our time was spent running through the woods, swinging on vines and shit. Real country boy activities. I remember only bits and pieces of this, because I was 3-4 when it started, but what I clearly remember is waking up one night to the sound of my own voice. I thought \"I'm not talking?!?\" and then I looked in the corner of the room. There I saw a little boy, my size, huddled in the corner rubbing his arms as if he were cold. I don't believe I said anything, but he looked over at me, ran towards the window, and leaped through it. Now, You would expect the glass to shatter and it be this loud bang, but nothing happened. I began to get scared and started crying and screaming. My mom runs up the stairs to check on me. Turns out I just had a \"bad dream.\" or atleast that what she came too. Well, for the next few days, I felt like someone was following me, and I kept catching this little  motherfucker peeking at me from behind walls and shit. Those are the memories I have at that house, because shortly after I told my mom what all was happening, we fucking dipped out and moved. Apparently, I had been told several strange things by this \"little kid\" and I would go tell my mom. Things like \"Tomorrow a snake is going to crawl in the cabinet, you need to close the hole up.\" My mom would laugh it off, and sure as shit a snake would be in there the next day. She told me later in life the reason we moved is she woke up in the middle of the night to me sitting on the couch talking plainly to someone who wasnt there. I dont remember it, but she said I just kept saying \"I'll be your friend if you leave them alone. I love them. Don't bother them.\" and when she said something to me, I turned my head... stared directly at her.. and smiled. She told me that when I smiled, she hear ,as she put it, a \"god awful\" roar that shook the room, then a blast of air hit her, knocked her down. She the worst part was when I jumped off the couch and screamed \"YOU PROMISED YOU WOULDNT DO THAT. YOU NEED TO GO AWAY... GO AWAY BAD MAN... GO AWAY\" Remember, This part I have no memory of, and I to the day remain skeptical of this shit... but it keeps going... My mom apparently had some big deal where she went into my room and strongly told whatever it was that it wasnt welcome and had to go........ She never told me what happened next, but a week later we had a new home. I liked this home. It had a bunch of race cars and shit on the wall... a real knock out place for a 4-5 year old kid. Everything returned to normal. My brother went to live with our biological mother (I lived with my grandparents.. they adopted me because my mother said she didnt want me... they saved me from abortion) so it was just me in the home with my mom and dad. I had started a preschool literally a quarter of a mile from my home because my mom started working to help pay for our new home. Then... shit got wierd again. I was a preschool one day when a teacher called my mom going bat shit crazy... Apparently I told the woman that \"Susie said she loved you, and that her shoes that she loved were lost in the water.\" That might not seem like much, but susie was her sister who was kidnapped raped and dumped into the river. That lady never got onto me or anything after that... She always would stare me down and make me nap alone... Then the shit started happening at home. This time, my parents thought it was just a kid having and imaginary friend. This is were shit gets strange for me, because I can remember most of this. I'll indicate when i cant.\nI was 5, and had been preoccupied with my imaginary friend Uncle Daniel. My mom thought I was terrible at giving imaginary names, and that being my name is Daniel, I just projected it from my imagination. Anywho, I had become best buds with Uncle Daniel. I can never remember seeing what uncle daniel looked like, but I remember the voice. I would play with toys in my toyroom, and that homie was right beside me! Cowboys and indians and shit ya know? Then one day, he told me to go tell me mom that when we went to the beach next week, that we needed to take the VCR (kids, this was before DVD) because the television was broke and if we wanted to watch anything, we would need it. She laughed it off and just went on with business as usual. This hadn't been the first time Uncle Daniel had told me to tell her things... Usually I wouldnt and he would be angry with me. This time I did, and when we went into our condo at the beach, My mom turned pale. -I dont remember this part I am about to tell you, this is from my mothers mouth.- She grabbed and started shaking me saying \"Who told you that... who told you that\" she said I went completely blank faced and said to her \"MARY (moms Name) TAKE YOU HANDS OFF OF THE BOY\" and pushed her back with force. She said she started crying, and we left the beach after being there only 3-4 hours. She told me she couldnt look at me. We went home. My mom was wierd around me for the next couple of days. She wouldnt really look at me when talking to me, and had been calling about getting me evaluated by therapists (sp.) She said she didnt even have the chance to set up an appointment before things went CRAY CRAY. She said she woke up one night, and there I was on the couch again, talking just plain as day to someone she couldnt see. -No memory of this- she said she was apprehensive about saying anything to me, but she listened for a while. I was argueing with my imaginary friend Uncle Daniel. Apparently, he and I didnt see eye to eye with something he was gonna do, and I was basically breaking up with him. She said I told him I didnt want to see him anymore, and that he needed to go back. She said she had no idea what I meant by go back, but I stood up on my feet and started screaming \"GO BACK GO BACK GO BACK\" and thats when 2 pictures fell off the all, she heard HEAVY footsteps in the kitchen, and the door opened by itself. She said she spent the next 30 mins crying until I walked up to her and told her it was ok, and he was gone and she shouldnt be sad anymore. Wierd right? Well, He didnt go away. I remember this clearly, i was laying in bed with my dad one night because he had been particularly nasty to me that day and I didnt want to be alone... I all the sudden felt something tugging on my shirt, and when I turned, nothing was there. The bed we were in was up against the all, so there was a tiny crack between the wall and bed. I felt fingers... I to the day can remember each finger grabbing my side and pulling my shirt under the bed. I started screaming.. my dad hops up and asks me whats wrong... I tell him, and he instantly drops to the floor and looks under the bed... Nothing. At this point, my mom burst in from the other room and is freaking out. Now, This part gives me chillbumps still, and I'll try to explain completely. My parents have different versions of what happened, but ill give both. My dad, A non religious man who just believed I was being a kid, said to me later in life that he was looking at me, but suddenly I didnt look like myself anymore. I had changed and he couldnt figure it out. He said he asked me \"Are you ok.\" and thats when I supposedly told him \"The boy is my friend. I'm not going to hurt him.\" My dad said that it was in such a creepy voice that he fucking booked it out of the room. Each door he would go to would shut in front of him as if someone was slamming them shut. Then he said it just got calm again. He said he didnt sleep that night, but shrugged it off the next day after talking to co workers. My moms version of the story is different. She said that she felt someone holding her hand, and when she looked, I was standing beside her, but I was also on the bed. She said that the \"version\" of me on the bed looked contorted. She said she had an overwelming sense that things were ok, and that she looked at the \"Version\" on me holding her hand and said \"Please, He is a good boy, just leave him alone. You are scaring him all the time now.\" She said that somehow, The me on the bed looked normal, and the thing holding her hand howled and dissappeared. When I woke up the next day, Uncle Daniel was gone... And I didnt see him again until a few years later.\nThe next couple of years were simple... I didnt have any sort of scary shit happen other than watching scary movies and being afraid of the dark. The next couple of weird things are actually comforting to me.\nMy sister passed away when i was 8 years old. My mom had received a call from a Colordo police department and she was on the toilet seat crying (no she wasnt shitting or pissing.. she just broke down and had been folding towels) She said she walking in my room to wake me up, but say me sitting on the bed talking to someone. She tells me that I was giggling and saying \"So I wont see you again? Sissy dont go?\" I believe you should know, I called my sister sissy. My mom said she saw an impression on the bed next to me that lifted when she came in... She broke down. I apparently kept telling her \"But no, sissy is here. Sissy is here\" Weird I know. but this HAPPENED.\nI turn 10.\nA few months later my grandfather and grandmother pass away. It was about 3 months apart. I had a dream they were on their couch. They told me to tell everyone they were ok... So I did... this oddly brought peace to my entire family... but I was just a kid.\nSo, remember Uncle Daniel? Well, I am 10 years old and my family decides to go on a road trip to las vegas... its a long ass drive, and it took us three days. One night, We were in Arizona and the while we were asleep, the water faucent turned on in the bathroom. I went and turned it off being the only one awake. I lay down... it cuts back on. I walk in there, and cut it off again, irriated because I was tired. (I rememeber all of this) I went to go lay back down, And there was Uncle Daniel, sitting in a chair next to our bed. I SCREAMED, and my mom woke up. She said I was shaking, and she knew what I had seen. she said some shit like \"Begone foul spirit... i told you to leave him alone\" or something like that and he just disappeared... We left immediately.\n\nSo, Thats pretty much sums up my story. I know there it will be met with a lot of reddit skeptisim, but I promise you, these things happened. I never had any experiences after this other than things you can chaulk up to coincidence (basically being able to call when someone was going to get hurt, something would go wrong, or an accident would happen) I have never told any of my friends, they all wouldnt believe me anyhow. I did tell 2 different girlfriends that were pretty serious, and my mother backed me up. They somehow felt closer to me after hearing these stories. I would expect that they would turn tail and run. Anyhow, I guess the reason I am posting this is to see if anyone has had similar experiences, Or maybe when they were a child this happened. I'm not some freak of nature, and I'm a normal contributing member of society. Still, sometimes when I dream, Im talking to people I shouldnt be...","link_flair_text":null,"downs":0,"author":"[deleted]","domain":"self.nosleep","is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, I haven&amp;#39;t ever really told this story so here you go.

This is a huge problem.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jia6d/i_am_ronald_goldman_phd_psychology_educator/cbexzvi?context=5)|What is legal is related to what the public believes and supports. Generally, the public believes that male circumcision is beneficial or harmless. That's why we need more education.  Because we do not do female circumcisions in the U.S., it's easier to oppose it. By comparison, in Europe where male and female circumcision is rare, they think both are horrible acts to do to children.\n[What has lead your organization to make the claims that circumcision is \"physically, sexually, and psychologically harmful,\" compared to an organization such as the American Academy of Pediatrics who made it a point to reverse their previous stance on the subject and now states that the benefits outweigh the risks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jia6d/i_am_ronald_goldman_phd_psychology_educator/cbexdya?context=5)|The AAP has many conflicts of interest, including political, financial, personal, and cultural. Their position is generally based on American medical literature. The circumcision literature reflects the pro-circumcision bias of circumcised American researchers who seek to find benefits and avoid studying the harms of circumcision. The answer to the research question depends on what question is chosen as the focus of the research. The pro-circumcision bias in American medicine reflects the pro-circumcision bias in American culture. The United States is the only country in the world that circumcises many of its male infants for non-religious reasons.  Here is an interesting fact. Most doctors do not know the functions of the foreskin. I asked the WHO circumcision expert about the functions of the foreskin, and he did not know. He also promotes his own circumcision devices, a conflict of interest.  When there is a disagreement in a couple about circumcising a son, it is usually the father that wants the circumcision.

They are withdrawn in traumatic shock. They cannot escape physically, so they escape psychologically. In any case, we would not approve of cutting off other healthy body parts simply if we could make the surgery painless.  In many ways, circumcision is an exception to medical and ethical standards and principles. \n |Local anesthesia is not always used, is not effective in eliminating circumcision pain, and its effect wears off before the pain does after the surgery.

Trauma is often repeated behaviorally, directly and indirectly. For example, extensive study shows the association between childhood abuse and subsequent abuse of one’s children when an abused child becomes a parent. Similarly, those who are circumcised are likely to support the circumcision of others. There is an iceberg of underlying emotional factors that are generally connected with fears, anxieties, pain, sexuality, and threats to self-esteem.

Female circumcision is deemed genital mutilation whereas male circumcision is not. This is a huge problem.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;What is legal is related to what the public believes and supports. Generally, the public believes that male circumcision is beneficial or harmless. That&amp;#39;s why we need more education.  Because we do not do female circumcisions in the U.S., it&amp;#39;s easier to oppose it. By comparison, in Europe where male and female circumcision is rare, they think both are horrible acts to do to children.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jia6d/i_am_ronald_goldman_phd_psychology_educator/cbexdya?context=5\"&gt;What has lead your organization to make the claims that circumcision is &amp;quot;physically, sexually, and psychologically harmful,&amp;quot; compared to an organization such as the American Academy of Pediatrics who made it a point to reverse their previous stance on the subject and now states that the benefits outweigh the risks?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The AAP has many conflicts of interest, including political, financial, personal, and cultural. Their position is generally based on American medical literature. The circumcision literature reflects the pro-circumcision bias of circumcised American researchers who seek to find benefits and avoid studying the harms of circumcision. The answer to the research question depends on what question is chosen as the focus of the research. The pro-circumcision bias in American medicine reflects the pro-circumcision bias in American culture. The United States is the only country in the world that circumcises many of its male infants for non-religious reasons.  Here is an interesting fact. Most doctors do not know the functions of the foreskin. I asked the WHO circumcision expert about the functions of the foreskin, and he did not know. He also promotes his own circumcision devices, a conflict of interest.  When there is a disagreement in a couple about circumcising a son, it is usually the father that wants the circumcision. We support women to deal with this situation. Here&amp;#39;s a great &lt;a href=\"http://www.circumcision.org/strength.htm\"&gt;personal account] ([Link to www.circumcision.org&lt;/a&gt; of a woman who found her strength talking to her husband about circumcision.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jia6d/i_am_ronald_goldman_phd_psychology_educator/cbezqta?context=5\"&gt;2) Respectfully, I requested information supporting the claim that circumcision is so severely damaging yet it seems like your response was to instead wag a finger towards the pro-circumcision stance. Perhaps I simply misunderstood your reply or perhaps I didn&amp;#39;t communicate my request well - I&amp;#39;m looking for medical/professional studies indicating the negative claims you have asserted. Are there any you could recommend to support these claims?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Infants do not &amp;quot;sleep&amp;quot; through circumcision. They are withdrawn in traumatic shock. They cannot escape physically, so they escape psychologically. In any case, we would not approve of cutting off other healthy body parts simply if we could make the surgery painless.  In many ways, circumcision is an exception to medical and ethical standards and principles.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Local anesthesia is not always used, is not effective in eliminating circumcision pain, and its effect wears off before the pain does after the surgery. The major effect of anesthesia is that it makes adults feel better, not the infants.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jia6d/i_am_ronald_goldman_phd_psychology_educator/cbex911?context=5\"&gt;What your response to people when they say circumcision is healthier because it will cut down on STDs and UTIs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to make that claim, but when you look at the studies there are flaws and very low rates of incidence.

Those who are thoroughly educated on the topic don&amp;#39;t tend to cut - why aren&amp;#39;t parents looking for every shred of evidence to avoid having to pay a doc to take a scalpel to their child&amp;#39;s healthy genitals?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been saying for a long time that circumcision is a psychological issue disguised as a medical issue.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Research on infant responses to circumcision, trauma theory, and clinical experience support the view that circumcision is traumatic. Trauma is often repeated behaviorally, directly and indirectly. For example, extensive study shows the association between childhood abuse and subsequent abuse of one’s children when an abused child becomes a parent. Similarly, those who are circumcised are likely to support the circumcision of others. There is an iceberg of underlying emotional factors that are generally connected with fears, anxieties, pain, sexuality, and threats to self-esteem. Together they contribute to a compulsion to repeat the circumcision trauma. This compulsion to repeat the trauma can take the form of a compulsion to generate studies that are intended to show “health&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jia6d/i_am_ronald_goldman_phd_psychology_educator/cbf0eb2?context=5\"&gt;My wife comes from a religion wherein circumcision is routinely performed on young boys (but not infants).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;This is why we advise young couples to talk about circumcision before committing to the relationship.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jia6d/i_am_ronald_goldman_phd_psychology_educator/cbex5ar?context=5\"&gt;In 30 seconds or less, how can I convince my wife and my friends that circumcision is neither healthy nor necessary for a newborn boy?

Unlike most of my friends from high school who went on to higher education, I joined the Marine Corps. After bootcamp and then School of Infantry, I was stationed in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii on the isle of Oahu. Up to this point, the only authority figures my peers and I had were drill instructors and SOI instructors. We arrived on the lawn of our new barracks in our alpha uniforms with gritted teeth expecting more of the usual rough treatment we&amp;#39;d become accustomed to. Then I saw him. On the third floor of the barracks a crowd had gathered on the balcony. Everyone had beers in their hands and a couch was tossed over the balcony. On the couch wearing a kevlar and flak jacket and holding his fist victoriously to the sky in a manner that would suggest he was riding Falkor from the Never-ending story was a man who would later be identified as my squad leader and for all intents and purposes, my new boss. The couch broke into various pieces upon the lawn but my squad leader rolled for a ways before standing up again, dusted himself off and went back inside with applause and cheers from the upper deck. This same night it comes to pass that the duty NCO, who is the man in charge of the barracks, comes down and finds my peers and I and assigns us each to our rooms and tells us that we are under orders to remain in the barracks for our first night. So I walk into my room and there&amp;#39;s already someone inside, having wild sex with a chick. Now at this point, I&amp;#39;m 18 years old and I must have had an unsuccessful high school life because I was a virgin, so it was definitely awkward. I introduced myself, explained that I was new there and I offered to leave the room so they could have privacy, but the NCO who was right outside insisted I had to remain in my assigned room for the first night. It was his ass on the line if we disappeared. For some reason the nude couple in my room both found me terribly interesting. They were both hammered but they stopped mid-sex, and butt-naked and came over insisting that we all have a long talk to get to know each other. So I chat with the naked couple for about an hour before finally hitting the hay and they decide to finish doing the nasty in the bed right beside me.

Didn&amp;#39;t want want an Office Space situation where my life has no meaning so I joined the Marine Corps to think about it before I dug my college debt-hole. Ended up being stationed in Hawaii. Surfed, partied and lived the good life there. Did two tours and one day while responding to an IED attack, found myself wrist deep in people&amp;#39;s abdomens because the corpsman (field medic) needed an extra set of hands. Purpose found.

This guy could write a fantasy novel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s debatable to say that you make less money in the marine corps. For one, as a married marine he will be given a home to live in for free, and not have to pay bills or taxes. He will have access to shopping districts on bases that are tax free which will sell pretty much everything. His paycheck will be less, but he will be given a bonus every four years. To give you an idea of how much, I was an infantry rifleman in the marines (enlisted, not officer) and in 2008 when my enlistment was up as a corporal my reenlistment bonus was in the neighborhood of 90k. Furthermore, if you retire after 20 years, you make 50% of whatever your pay grade is at retirement for the rest of your life. 75% after 30 years. I&amp;#39;m going to college myself now and my current employer retired after 20 yrs from the air force and decided to start a restaurant. He&amp;#39;s been doing that for 15 years now. Between his retirement checks and his income from his second career, he has a 4-story house, bought houses for his 2 kids, and is currently worth around 6 million dollars.
