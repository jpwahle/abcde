Some more interesting than others. On their own, some of these may not seem that remarkable. All told together, they are really... unbelievable. I completely understand when people say they don't believe me.\n\nBut I have to put them out there, because I have no one to tell them all to. I've never written them all down, but they weigh inside my head begging to be let out. Something inside constantly tells me that someone else has to hear them. Some of them I can tell people, some of them I can only tell a few people. Some of them are secrets. Some of them involve death and tragedy, others are personal, shameful or humiliating, so providing details or identifying information is impossible.\n\nAll I can say is every one of these stories happened or is currently happening to me, my family or people we are close to. I don't have an explanation for all of it. Maybe it's not as unusual as I think and more people than I realize have similar stories. I grew up pretty well off and went to a private school, may that explains most of it. Or maybe I just live in a simulation and none of this is real. Anyways, here goes:\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nI have four brothers. We all grew up in the US and we're all still alive. My dad passed away a decade ago and my mom is still going strong. They were ~40 when I was born and I'm 37.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**Story 1**\n\nMy mom grew up middle class in subruban New York. She had a very normal, average life for that time period as far as I know. Her father was a travelling salesman and her mother was a housewife who occasionally worked part time doing random jobs. Her father was about 20 years older than her mother, and a veteran of both WWI and WWII, but that was the most remarkable thing she knew about her family growing up. They weren't wealthy, but they weren't poor. She went to the local public school.\n\nHer best friend from kindergarten all the way to today was the daughter of a man who would go on to become a self-made billionaire. Yes, an actual *billionaire*. He has his own Wikipedia page and is now deceased. That's as much information as I'll give about him.\n\nHe was a tyrant, an absolute psychopath, both physically and psychologically abusive to his wife and daughter (my mom's friend). Not all billionaires are necessarily psychopaths, but he certainly fit the stereotype to a T, combined with the old school chauvinistic machismo and hidden personal life of the 1950s.\n\nWhen they were 18, my mom's friend fell pregnant by her boyfriend. My mom had no idea, and as far as she knew they both went off to different colleges after high school graduation. In reality, the billionaire locked his daughter in their basement after graduation, where she lived and did not leave for the final 6 months of her pregnancy. When she finally gave birth in their house, she was immediately forced to give the baby up for adoption and never saw it again.\n\nYears later she confessed to my mom what happened, and my mom has painfully pleaded with her over the decades to look into what ever happened to the baby. She said she will never look into it for fear that she'll find out the baby went on to live a tragic life, and she couldn't handle finding that out.\n\nSince then, she married and went on to have 5 more kids with the same boyfriend, who was (predictably) abusive as well. They divorced and she married once more to a man who was caught sexually abusing the friend of one of her children. Recently, as an elderly woman, she revealed to my mom that she was repeatedly sexually abused by a family friend when she was a small child.\n\nAs I mentioned, her father died, and she inherited a substantial portion of his wealth. Somewhere out there may be living an adopted middle aged man or woman who is one of the grandchildren and heirs to an actual billionaire, but has no idea.\n\nMany years ago I once briefly dated the woman's daughter, who is my age. I never talked to her about the adopted baby (my mom is the one who told me the story) but as far as I know none of her kids know about their long lost older sibling.\n\nJust remember, no matter how good you think someone has it - this woman has more money than you or I will probably ever see - you don't know how good their life is. She's had the most tragic life of anyone I know.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**TL;DR** I'm not going to give a TLDR. If you don't want to read it, don't. If you don't want to believe it, don't. This is for me to get off my chest, regardless of how you take it. I can't and won't prove any of it.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TrueOffMyChest","subreddit_id":"t5_2yuqy","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TrueOffMyChest","subreddit_subscribers":1900915,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"The stories of my family and friends are fascinating, tragic and improbable.

It saddens me that since graduating high school, my mental health and my physical strength, have been a huge play with being able to ride this year, and since graduation. Before stopping, at my local barn, there was a horse I'd really gotten to become wonderful buddies with, and we had even started to pick up on each others signals, and he would recognize me every time I went there...So if you can imagine, even though I knew this was most likely going to happen, still, it was a big upset after my muscles had stiffened, and weakened again after draining myself out completely empty, and not wanting to do anything after high school.   \n\n\nWhile most of my pain and weakness is mainly off my mental health reasons, my EDS problem(s) are an entire \"other category\" of stuff that makes it difficult for riding twice a week. This was the routine schedule before graduation, then after only the first year after, it was once a week. During school, after school after graduation, basically all the time it had almost seemed, the EDS factor effects my overall pain level in those areas, along with my knees, and shoulder blades, and occasional slips\/dislocations of the knee and shoulder. It really sucks, I bet some of you might know, but, we all know what happens to your stamina and \"skill leveling,\" if you have weakened, sore, or stiff muscles\/bones\/joints. Of course, it may not be your fault all the time necessarily, but in my case it was, at least in the fact that I couldn't control it, and it was \"just is\" type of matter, rather than me contributing to my issue. Way, way back, the same thing happened to me in marching band ballet, either performing or at rehearsal\/classes.   \n\n\nI've decided, until I have it some what managed, and are working on it more frequently, there is something else I'd like to work on. I would also love to brush up on my education I was taught at my career center from a couple years ago. I graduated with a certification in equine science, but it's hard for me to retain memory well, even with things I love to learn. I learn best through auditory and visual teaching.   \n\n\nRegardless, the other reason for asking - it's almost Christmas &amp; my mom will be asking for gift ideas. Yes even though I'm 22, she still loves to do that lot lol. I was pondering for a while earlier on something I hadn't asked for at all out of every year, not even the past couple of years. I've immensly missed the feeling of riding as explained above, so she naturally knows this, much more out of everyone, as well as my bf. She herself, actually used to ride in college as an extracurricular class. In my early adult days, we've decided I should just write what specifically I would like from her, to ask instead of writing down a list and making that a hassle.   \n\n\nToday I started searching up some book(s) recommendations on education and \"encyclopedia\" picture book types on horses. On a couple of websites, I noticed lots of classics were listed, but not many new ones were. I've done some research on the reviews of a couple of the books. I'm going to put down at least 3 that seemed iffy to the viewers, and iffy to me while sifting through the information. I'll also put down 3 that seemed to have very good reviews and comments about the types of education that was taught in the books. If you guys are an experienced rider, or have knowledge in equine science, I would really love to encourage your comments and let me know which of these you've read, or haven't read, or what are on your bucket lists!! Even if you aren't any of the above, and just casually ride or love horses, I'd love to hear from you as well!!!

I'm stumped.\n\nMy name is Bulat, I'm 24 years old, born and raised in Russia. At the end of February I left my fucking country with my most beloved girl in the world. I thought we could overcome any obstacles together, but a month ago she left me.\n\nI don't know how to live for myself. I spent all the money to move, I thought I would live and work together with her, but as soon as we moved into the new apartment, we broke up and a week later I was also fired. They fired me because I couldn't handle the stress of the breakup. Now I have no income, and the rental agreement is in her name. I can't live with her because she has started walking Turks home and asking me to come out so she can get laid. It hurts like hell.\n\nNow I'm living with other Russian guys, I promised them I'd pay them next month, but I don't know if I can get a job. I have no money even for food. I have no higher education because I was kicked out due to anti-government protests back in 2017. I also can't apply for asylum, because too much time has passed since then. Also, I'm not persecuted in Russia. And if I return home and get drafted into the army, I will not be able to leave Russia because the border guards will not let me out.\n\nI can't go home. Those cannibals took my two brothers to the war, a couple of friends have already been killed. It's scary to imagine what's happening to my friends from Ukraine now.\n\nI don't know what to do and where to go. I made a resume in English, but it's fucking cheesy. I don't understand how to live. I have a technical mind, I love to learn new things, I'm not afraid of change. but my fucking government and the passivity of the people I lived with has led to the fact that we are all fucked now.\nI have a sister in the states, but she says it's impossible for me to find a job there. They say there are enough migrants of their own. I can't find a job in Europe either. I can't find anything at all. I don't want to believe that I, as a 24-year-old guy, was left on the street in a country that is completely foreign to me, with absolutely no prospects. What am I supposed to do?\n\nAll this hopelessness keeps pushing me to suicidal thoughts. I communicate with a volunteer psychologist, she keeps me sane, thank her for that. But it can't go on like this forever. It seems to me that I have lost this life.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"helpme","subreddit_id":"t5_2qpmh","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/helpme","subreddit_subscribers":52848,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I'm stumped.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/helpme\/comments\/z983e6\/im_stumped\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

This was NOT expected. He did an entire month away at one of the programs we ranked in our top 3. His interviews went well. He has decent scores and research, nothing out of the park but we weren't reaching on programs either. I had been bracing myself to figure out where we are going to move, and it feels like we have a non-start. We have some backup plans, and it's not as bad as not matching residency. He can get a hospitalist job worst case scenario. It just feels like so much. I'm 36 weeks pregnant with our second kid and we have no idea what's going to happen in 6 months. Our family asked us what now, and we have no clue. Just feeling listless and disheartened. I was hoping to talk about the house and our loans and all sorts of things. We're going to order Chinese food and watch anime and sort of wallow instead. 😓 We'll come up with a game plan. He's reached out to programs to soap already, but he's on nights this month so his schedule is flipped. He woke up, read the email, sent a few emails, and went back to sleep. This just sucks. Our friends are kind of shocked as well. We knew it was a possibility, but didn't really plan for this as he had 7 interviews and a strong away rotation where they REALLY liked him. Just wanting to vent to people who get it, as all of my friends are either out of medicine or have no plans for fellowship. It's a weird feeling.\n\nUpdate: we are so lucky to have the program we have. The specialty (which I never mentioned re-reading my post) is hem-onc. Our home program has been working hard to get an in-house fellowship and got railroaded for a few years, and the department reached out to my husband and offered him a spot to rotate with their bone marrow transplant team for his gap year. They are still trying to get an in-house program off the ground and have stated that he would be nearly guaranteed a spot once it's completed, but that may mean an extra gap year. We will still apply next year, but there's an opportunity for him to provide BMT hospitalist coverage if he goes unmatched for a second year. His program director reached out on her vacation to offer any help, and they are already talking about what he will need as far as research and how to support him. He has reached out to a few programs, but what we've found is ALL of them matched internally. It's been a long week, but we are so thankful for the advice and encouragement.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MedSpouse","subreddit_id":"t5_32t39","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/MedSpouse","subreddit_subscribers":8675,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Didn't match fellowship","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.91,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MedSpouse\/comments\/z9883v\/didnt_match_fellowship\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}

Just games in general I am passionate about and I hope you are as well.  Besides that. I think mental health and self care is really important. Along with communication and having balance in life. I have a strong set of morals. I prefer to take things slow at first. I always had dreamed of loving someone from a long time of being friends. I don't mind long distance either but after a year or two of dating I'm going to push for moving in with you if things are well between us. I also don't mind if there's a timezone difference either will work things out.\nA little about me. I'm really nerdy. I'm goofy and weird. I can be nice. Kind.  Caring and Understanding.

I love roleplay and sometimes miss sex in it cause my friend doesnt like sex scenes, I have liked doujinshis....but I dont think I have ever desired sex with anyone, I have had crushes on guys and girls so I might be biromantic, but I have never imagined sex with a real person....someone who is not an anime, game or book character, I constantly obsess over anime men, it keeps me sane and helps me cope with my trauma but I feel angry at people in relationships, especially those who play otome games and read smut and do it with their partners, I made a similar post like that but now it is more different. I have very negative view of people who do friends with benefits and one night stands, in my mind they use people and in my humble and little experience most people just parade around with their partners, where I live, people hate the lgbtq and parades and make fun of them - for me public kissing and grinding on a person's lap on a bench and talking about your lover makes me severely uncomfortable. I have kissed a guy once but like to not think about it since he was a fuckboy, I wouldnt have gotten my first kiss at all and he had many girlfriends and left me for dead to pursue girls with friend, due to my trauma I hardly trust and find it hard to enjoy sex as a concept, to me it looks like something i must do, especially with men, they just look like dirty abusive creatures with penises, I try my best to avoid them and not speak to them due to my trauma and being rejected all of my life. I have cried about him no longer being my friend more than him rejecting me as a potential gf.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I try to go on dates but now I realize that i am a girl. I am not mentally slow like guys are, most of my childhood I only had male friends and have warm memories with them but then guys became rude and agressive and mostly bullied me, especially in high school I cried a lot and felt unsafe especially from sporty guys, which make me severely uncomfortable. I find it hard to find any form of attraction to a man which I didnt seem  to have problem with before, I cant fall in love with them I can't imagine sex at all, it looks like a chore I must do, I cant imagine doing it for my own pleasure, I want it to end as soon as possible but i feel the same about hugs and affection in general but sex has always been a problem. My therapist was shocked to hear that I have never masturbated and I am 21, I have tried it, it felt meh and weird and never tried again. My lack of experience drives me nuts, since people thought I was a loser without friends who no one wants all of my life which made me self isolate and develop anxiety which made people hate me and bully me even more leaving me feel lonely, and now I am an introverted loser who has never had a boyfriend, it feels humiliating all of my life and I feel so behind my peers, it is ....weird to date. I am either scared or bored or uncomfortable and most of the guys are ordinary, I am not supposed to hate an entire gender due to my trauma, I dont treat anyone badly per se, but do avoid them and dont verbally talk and and try to leave as soon as possible whcih makes people dislike me, I find small talk and conversations hard ever since puberty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Some guys shame me and call me defective on tinder and badoo for never doing it, others want to make sure I am a virgin even though they f-ed 10 people ....like weird double standarts, I feel like its a fetish at this point. I am open about sex as a topic but as soon as I open it boys tell me how much they love blowjobs and unless my head game is good I am not good at anything in life. Most people look for hookups and I guess being horny makes you an ahole????? to people? To girls? I have been heavily bullied for being more boyishly presenting aesthetically wiht my short hair which got me told I am trans, lesbian and other more hurtful insults, even if I present feminine I feel like I cosplay as a woman by being a girl or am overly mature alcoholic woman no one wants and finds ugly. Most guys who do one night stands and fwb change a lot of partners and are extremely judgmeental, so are girls, this is my life experience, so you can change many partners in love and sex ....but me never doing it wiht anyone or having a partner somehow bothers you????? why? How does that help you in any way? People who don't have a partner are concidered \"lower\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I dont understand why I have never had a boyfriend, Ive always assumed I was ugly or had horrible personality since guys made advances on other girls all the time and in high school the most horrible and manipulative girls had the most attention...god knows why. I dont understand relationships..I will probably die alone as a woman because guys scare me. I know tinder\/badoo are bad places but I cant find guys my age anywhere else, I dont do go to bars and with my dead father and mother's cancer...I dont really have a chance to go to clubs for interests to meet guys. I have thought about dancing but the thought of dancing with a guy and him touching my waist sounds dreadful, it seems the most stupid and smiley girls, or evil and nasty girls seem to get guys's attention and I do not say this to sound bitter...I do not understand how their character's traits despite toxic are able to attract a guy? I can be annoying or whiney or boring for example but I try to read self help books and exercise to cope with that, I dont know if I am doing a good job though. Every guy I texted has complained about being ghosted and yet some guys no longer respond to me when I text them, so I guess it goes both ways?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I dont understand what is attractive to guys but as a teen I have had older men whistle at me and be mean to me and I have had boys call me ugly on the bus to home so I never really wanted male attention, it feels icky, and ironically do I love doujinshis and fanfictions, I guess its because I can finally be loved and not rejected though??? It feels like I have an emotional connection with someone which is why I suspect I am more of a demisexual? I am 21 and most girls my age are on their 4th and hell even 10th boyfriend, one of my collegues married and I am over here with zero boyfriends. I apologize if I sound like an incel, it is not - POOR ME I HAVE NO BOYFRIEND - it is more I don't understand romantic relationships and why I have never had them, why has no boy proposed to me and only I express my feelings and how can I overcome my fear of sex and intimacy? If I dress overly feminine guys open doors for me but i dont need that, I want to expeirence sex at least once, I am not saving my self for someone special but do want it to be with someone I trust and at least like visually, most guys have these shaven hairs and ripped short jeans and philip plain shirts and my mum tells me I am picky. It is ugly to me. I dont feel beautiful my self and dont want to be touched it scares me. High school made me feel like a living breathing tumor that didn't deserve to live and being told I am disgusting all of my life and some guys continuing to move away as if I smell and not wanting to be near me ruined me. There was nothing wrong me with objective stand point but I started to neglect my self and not eat or wash for a short period of time due to the abuse. Despite reporting it noting changed and I can't get over it, it affects how I see guys, I feel like unless I am cold I can't survive.

In every friend group I've been in, I've always felt like an outsider. I was inside a lot of different friend groups in high school but there always felt like an element that connected them on a deeper level than I could. For my basketball friends it was the fact that I was the only white kid. In my show choir band friend group, I was the only one not in regular band classes because I played guitar. When I was a kid in middle school, I noticed I was home by myself a lot more than the other kids because they all lived closer to the school.\n\nWhen I went to college, I met a new group of people immediately during welcome week but we slowly faded as the 1st year went on because I think subconsciously we all realized we weren't very confident people and we were sort of clinging on to each other out of comfort. After them, I wouldn't make another friend the next 3 years of college outside of my housemates. I never joined any clubs or got involved in any way. Essentially, if I wasn't with my housemates or in class, I was alone consuming YouTube.\n\nHere's the weird thing about all this: I feel like I love people. I love being in groups where everyone knows how to make each other laugh. I love adventurous and socially confident people who want to go do new things and travel to new places. But I've never felt like I am on the level of those people. I've always felt pretty insecure about who I am in terms of people valuing me. I still see friends from high school who live in my hometown, but I've never been able to branch out past them. I am an overthinker, codependent, very introspective, and have an anxious attachment style, all things I've learned about myself through therapy over the years. I am so tired of analyzing myself. Of using YouTube as my main source of company. Of feeling like I am low in social status\/value. Of feeling alone and like I am so far away from things like a strong group of friends and an intimate relationship. It's all been bubbling up lately now more than ever.

Happy to be here. I've been a paracosm adventurer since I can remember really, and I still have characters that exist within mine from when I was a kid (I'm 25 now). I often absolutely lose myself in this imagination, I can entertain myself for hours, but also seems to be a big reason I procrastinate or disassociate so much! I'll work on that balance lol. I didn't know there was a name for this today, so i thought id pop in share some of mine!\n\nI have 5 paracosms that I really maintain. These are: \n\n\\- One for music. I have fictional artists in my head with fictional discographies and songs that only exist in my head. Sometimes I repurpose songs I like from real life for these fictional artists, sometimes i have real artists that continue on with fictional albums and songs that I imagine! this dates back to when I was about 10 \n\n\\- One for pro wrestling! I have multiple companies, fictional wrestlers, some real wrestlers that ive stolen for this world, i book feuds, matches, i even imagine podcasts that review the matches in retrospect haha! this also dates back to when i was about 10 \n\n\\- One for mixed martial arts. this is very akin to the wrestling one where its different promotions, fictional and real athletes, and fictional discourse around these events. however, I often flip my phone on the couch to randomise winners, kinda like a coin flip. who's side lands 2 out of 3 times across '3 rounds' wins. i get absolutely sucked into this format and often at times find myself eager to get home and delve in. Weirdly this one popped up when I was 18 \n\n\\- One where it's fictional movies, with fictional directors and actors (weirdly i dont use any real life actors for this one). I have movie series in my head, and i often flip my phone or something else to determine box office results (the system for this one only makes sense in my head i find it hard to articulate) \n\n\\- Another music one where it requires me listening to an artist or band I really like. I curate setlists, imagine myself as the front man performing live with a band, or imagine that i just started this band and these were my first singles. I get lost in this one a lot when I'm walking or on the way to work; i completely zone out. I also get somewhat of a emotional response from this one because I often imagine my friends or parents in the crowd haha. This one has proven great for when i'm walking up a hill! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere have been more in the past that I have since somewhat abandoned, but their existence is still relevant because some link to the universes i currently have.

I'm Alex, nice to meet ya. Welcome to my (mediocre) attempt at finding the right person to experience this vast world with.\n\n       \n                                   ~about me~\n\nPhysically I'd say I'm pretty good looking, I'm 5'9 and a bit on the larger side at 195lbs. I have long curly brown hair and blue eyes. \n\nPersonality wise I'm a pretty big introvert, I'm also fairly shy, but once I open up I'm very caring and affectionate. Personally I'd say I fall into the golden retriever guy stereotype. \n\nAs for my hobbies\/interests I'm a pretty big nerd. I play alot of video games, I watch a lot of anime\/read manga, I like super hero movies\/comics, star wars, programming\/game design, and for my less nerdy hobbies I work out, and I love music.\n\nWhere am I at in life? Well, I'm still in high school, I'm currently in my senior year. I do online school and I'm a decent amount ahead of where I'm supposed to be so I'll be graduating early. Once I graduate I'll be going to college to get my degree in computer science. And that's as much of my life that I have planned currently.\n\nMental health\/trauma I think being upfront is important so I'll go ahead and add this here, I struggle pretty badly with depression and I'm pretty sensitive for a guy. I also grew up in a rough situation so I have my fair share of trauma and parental issues. \n\n                      ~what I'm looking for~\n\nIm looking for a long term relationship, I wanna be with someone I can experience life and grow with. I want someone that'll push me to be better, and ofcourse I'll do the same for them. I want a genuine love, let me be your safe space and you be mine.  So if that doesn't sound like something you'd like keep moving.\n\nPhysically my ideal partner would be on the shorter side, a bit chubby, and goth\/alt. However, I'm not super picky about physical appearance so if that doesn't describe you dont worry. \n\nDistance doesn't matter as long as there's plans to be IRL in the future.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my post! My DMs are open so please feel free to message me!

The reasoning for this was to see how I respond to the patches and having consistent estrogen for a cycle before pursuing anything else, and that some people respond really well and its all they need.  The patches made me irritable af and it was a really shitty month.  This confirmed that I'm sensitive to both estrogen and progesterone.\n\nTried a low dose of prozac (5mg) for about 6 weeks, the reasoning being mostly to help with fatigue and a good complement to hormone therapy -  it did help, was easier to get out of bed in the morning and get things done but I was feeling really on edge all the time with heightened anxiety and couldnt handle that.\n\nI stopped  prozac and the estrogen patches and was cleared to start Synarel nasal spray to induce Chemical Menopause, suppressing production of hormones in the ovaries.  There could be sideffects and worsened symptoms the first month or so. If I tolerated it we'd need to add back hormones to reduce health risks.  she also gave me a script for estrogel and said if i start getting hot flushes or other menopause symptoms to just start with 1 pump of gel a day.\n\n**Start of chemical menopause:**  \nI started Synarel on day 1 of my cycle in September, I didn't notice anything much in the first week.  \nI was getting night sweats so I started the estrogel on day 5.\n\nWeeks 2-3 I had a spike in PMDD symptoms (normal reaction to starting synarel - the ovaries can go into overdrive for a bit before they stop producing hormones altogether.)  \nThis settled down by the end of week 4-ish\n\nI was on 1 pump of estrogel the first 6 weeks (.75mg estradiol), which kept menopause symptoms at bay.  Increased to 2 pumps (1.5mg) in week 7 at Endocrinologists recomendation.\n\n**Today** \\- I'm 3 months into chemical menopause, 92 days since my last period. I've had no noticeable ongoing sideffects, no breakthrough bleeding, still on 2 pumps of synarel spray per day and 2 pumps of estrogel.  No hell week.  \nPlanning a 7 day course of progesterone in february which i'll take time off work for (need to do this every 3-4 months to reduce health risks).\n\nAiming to have a full hysterectomy in 12months when the private health cover waiting period is over.   Endo and Psych have a Gynaecologist they often refer to who will perform surgery for PMDD at age 35 without having to plead your case before an ethics board (which i'm told is  what would happen if trying to go via the public system).\n\n**Curveball - ADHD diagnosis**  \nPsychiatrist threw me a curveball and diagnosed me with ADHD, gamechanger!  but also - chemical menopause won't solve all my problems (sigh).  I've been trialling adhd meds the past few months and we're close to getting them right, anxiety is improving, motivation and focus.  I'm on ritalin and about to trial guanfacine, i'm hoping for improvements in my sleep situation which im still taking seroquel for.\n\n(Acknowleging my privilege in being able to work part time, afford and access these specialists and treatments)\n\nI've learnt so much from these 2 specialists; its been a relief being heard, validated and not having to be on alert and advocating for myself to a health professional which has been a frequent occurence the past 5 yrs. They were able to educate me rather than the other way around.  All of their suggestions have been based on many years of experience and what they've seen in other patients with PMDD.  It's so worth shopping around until you find a good doc!  \n\n\nPMDD doesn't work the same from one person to another, this is just whats been right for me.  Feel free to ask me anything :)   \n\n\nChemical menopause info from IAPMD  \n[https:\/\/iapmd.org\/chemical-menopause#:\\~:text=This%20is%20also%20sometimes%20called,hormonal%20fluctuations%20%3D%20No%20PMDD%20symptoms](https:\/\/iapmd.org\/chemical-menopause#:~:text=This%20is%20also%20sometimes%20called,hormonal%20fluctuations%20%3D%20No%20PMDD%20symptoms).","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PMDD","subreddit_id":"t5_2tokr","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/PMDD","subreddit_subscribers":50684,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Chemical Menopause for PMDD - Synarel - my experience","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PMDD\/comments\/z99593\/chemical_menopause_for_pmdd_synarel_my_experience\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

Yet we all live together, work and study together. The social dynamic would be different to humans with many prey staying together for safety whilst predators are more lone or less in number. Larger prey have a hard time being taken down but with enough predators no one is safe.\n\nStudents and teachers at any time during the day could be eaten, mutilated or raped. Friendships with other predators help protect some prey. Strength in numbers usually protects most little helpless prey. It isn’t common to have a feeding frenzy or a fight break between predators for hunting rights. Some prey even know who will eat them but not exactly when. Friendships between prey and predator is rare but non too uncommon.\n\nPrey usually stay alive by being protected, running away or offering themselves to be used. This doesn’t always work as predators get overly excited and will start to eat during or after rough sex.\n\nI’m looking for someone to play a predator or multiple characters as the GM. Whilst I will play one prey at a time. If my character expires then I shall choose a new one and we can keep playing!!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nPlease be literate and detailed as I will just block you if I do not feel like you are detailed enough. I’d like more than a decent paragraph AT LEAST!\n\nI have no limits at all! But prefer things to be somewhat realistic with sizes and proportions.\nAll characters 18+ I have many refs for my character and I would like you to bring a few of your own.\n\nI’d like this to be as relaxed and chilled as possible haha\n_____________________________________\n\nPlease send more then hi or hey, I’d like to be told everything about your ideas and experience and style.

We really do not get much action, and I have been a freak since I was 10 (I was molested and exposed to hardcore porn by my childhood friend and his next door 12 year old female neighbor) so that is one area my wife and I do not mix well. I grew up in a conservative-religious household, so I never told anyone what happen to me when I was 10, or about my very rare sexual attraction to certain men because people of faith don't take kindly to homosexuality. Anyway, my dad just died of a stroke, I am in a dry spell in my marriage, and I am very down, so I suppose me writing out my most secret fantasy to Reddit strangers is just what you do?! (who cares, people barely read the whole story anyway - keep scrolling if you don't like long stories) - This is a true story that I add my own fantasy on top of it - I will note when my fantasy starts below.  \nI have a friend I have known since I was 15, we work in the same industry, he is a GORGEOUS guy. His family is insanely wealthy and they have always treated me like a son and are better to me than my own family is. He works in large finance here in Atlanta and looks the part. He is 6'3, dirty blonde, very fit and athletic (think tennis\/golf + cross fit), gorgeous smile, pretty green eyes, great personality, very charming. The guy has it all. Ever since I have known him, I have had a crush on him, but always kept it under wraps. My own wife has made many comments about how hot he is and how, \"It must be nice....\" when she would talk about his girlfriends being with him. He has always dated gorgeous women since high school (of course, he is charming, gorgeous, and insanely wealthy), but they are all the same self-seeking social climbing woman type - I never liked any of them. But a few years back he broke up with a girl he really liked (this girl ended up cheating on him with an ATL Hawks player) and he was devastated. It was sad, he was depressed and down for months over this girl and she was off on trips with these other men and posting all over her social media.  \nOne day I invited him over to hang out to get his mind off of her. We hung out for about 2 hours before he had to leave. My wife was out with her friends, so when I gave him that bro hand shake, did the one arm bro hug, and then I put my hand on his shoulder and let it linger there for a few seconds longer than normal I felt that horny urge swell up in my stomach and balls... (he left in reality, but everything below is my fantasy that I REALLY wish happened).  \nI place my hand on his shoulder, I am starting to get really turned on. I scan longingly up and down his perfect frame. I say, \"Can you stick around for a little longer? I hate to see you this down, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better....\" - \"hmm, well I can stay around for a little while longer.\" We are standing by the entry ottoman sofa that my wife has near the door, I start complimenting him on how he is a really good guy, has a lot going for him, and he just needs to have a fling with someone new to get over this girl who screwed him over. He replies, \"Yea... maybe you're right. What should I do?\" I reply, \"Well... why don't you find someone who knows you, cares about you, and wants you to be happy...and....see where it goes?\" He says, \"Well no shit, but where do I find someone like that?\".... I pause, It felt like 30 seconds went by, but I look him in the eye, give him a soft-warm smile, and shrug my shoulders and put my hands up and point back at me as if to say, \"Why not me?\"  \nHe looks stunned. He paused for another 15 seconds, \"Bro...what? I never saw this happening, are you ga-.....what about your wife?!\" I reply, \"Hey man, you're one of my best friends, and we have shared so many stories we have never told anyone and never will. Just, let me see if I can cheer you up.....\" He didn't know what to say, he didn't say anything, but he definitely did not pull back or try to step away to leave...so I slowly take a step closer, I am 8 inches from his face...another step.....I slowly lean in, I grab one of his hands and put my other on his chest. He is breathing heavily, I move in slowly, I see him close his eyes, and then I just go for it.... \"MMMMMMMMMuah!\" I lay on a soft, passionate kiss. He opens his mouth and sighs, I kiss him again.... and again...and again...........and again. I pull on his lower lip with my lips and reach my hand around his lower back to pull him closer to me, our bodies are completely touching each other. I reach my other hand up around the back of his neck and run my fingers up through his hair. I grab his hair, pull his head back, I lick his neck, smell is intoxicating cologne, and begin to kiss his neck. I let out a moan, and he does too. My cock is literally trying to explode out of my pants (and is now just typing this all out), I reach my other hand from around his lower back and I grab his crotch through his pants....  \nI feel what feels like a MASSIVE hard cock. I have always known he has a huge dick, and the rumors\/gossip from high school and college have always confirmed this from girls he hooked up with (and he was very prolific), but I have never seen it myself. I whisper, \"So what I've heard all these years is true..\" He replied, \"What is?\" I whisper in his hear, \"That you have the nicest cock anyone has ever seen.\" and then I lick and suck on his ear. He sighs, and goose bumps appear all over his body. \"Yea? you like that babe?\" He says, \"uh-huh......\" and pin him against the wall. I reach down his pants and grab his cock and it really is MASSIVE. I start playing with his dick and asking him if he likes whats happening, he moaned, \"Yeaaaaa..\" I start undoing his belt and unbutton his pants. I slowly slide those down around his ankles and I see this gorgeous bulge pushing through his tight calvin klein underwear. \"Let me see what we are really working with here...\"   \nI kiss his bulge through his underwear and slowly pull the elastic waist band down and I see his bulging veiny cock start to peek out. I keep pulling it down and suddenly his cock just springs out and starts bouncing up and down, fully erect, and its an inch from my face, and I am 9 inches away from him (do the math). I am starring down this long, thick, groomed cock and I could literally cum just being down on my knees with my life long crush's cock in front of me. I look up into his eyes and smile, he is looking down and nods his head (saying, go ahead). I grab his cock with one hand at the base and reach around with my other hand to squeeze his ass. I grab his cock, slap it on my tongue and my face, kiss the tip, and put my mouth around his dick head. I moan, shake my butt, and start to work my mouth further down his penis. Slowly, I move in and out with my lips and my tongue is licking his tip, I already taste his pre-cum. I pull my mouth off to take a breath, and spit on his dick, put my mouth back on and start sucking his dick really good. My hand on his cock starts softly jerking him where my mouth can't reach, and my other hand is playfully slapping his adorable ass and squeezing one of his ass cheeks. He really starts moaning. I look up while sucking his dick and see his abbs contracting and he is trying to control his breathing so he doesn't cum too fast. I have him hooked and  cant wait to start sucking his balls. I pull my mouth off, lift up his cock, and move my mouth in to start licking and sucking his balls. He has really nice, thick, hanging, balls. I have one  ball in my mouth licking and sucking on it while I jerk him off and look up and give him eye contact - letting him know I am loving this as much as he is. I shake my butt and he bends down and spanks me.   \n\"Mmm, I like that, spank me again.\" \\*SLAP... WHAAP-WHAP\\* He spanks me three more times on my nice bubble butt (yes, I have been told from men and women I have a good ass). I tell him I want him to cum in my mouth and now that his cock is nice and wet from my spit, I put my mouth back to his dick and start jerking his shaft again with my other hand fondling his balls. He starts to moan and he leans his head back, \"OH FUCK! that feels good man, keep doing that.\" \\*suck, uggck, gluck\\* I keep working my mouth deeper and deeper and all the sounds of a good blowjob start coming out of my mouth. We are both moaning, I keep sucking his dick enthusiastically. He puts both hands on my head and starts pushing my head in deeper on his cock and I start 'glucking' on his cock and coughing as his dick hits the back of my throat. I pull back to gasp for some air and start two handing his dick. He says, \"Ohhh! Babe, I am going to cum!\" I get so turned on by him calling me Babe, I start tightening my grip and start jerking him really hard, the sound of his soaking wet dick is sloshing in between my hands has him twitching and I feel his balls tightening - he is about to cum! I jerk and jerk and jerk and then, \"OHHH FUCK! UHHH!!!\" he starts spraying cum everywhere! SPURT! a rope of cum shoots across my face and gets in my hair, SPURT! his cum rope hits my lips and nose. I keep jerking him- SPURT! another cumshot goes straight into my mouth. I put my mouth back on his dick and start licking his tip. SPPURT! a slightly weaker cumshot empties his balls into my mouth. Then a slight trickle of cum and semen slowly pour out of his penis and my mouth is just coated with his jizz. I swallow the cum, pull my mouth off, and look up at him. His eyes are closed, head up, and he gets weak in the legs, so I guide him down on the ottoman couch in our walk way. We are both out of breath and gasping for some air. I put my head on his knee while he is sitting and I am on my knees on the floor.  \n\"What the fuck was that man?\" I just smile and shrug. His cock is still hard and pulsing. He says, \"You know, I've always liked butt plugs, my ex used to plug me when we had sex.\" I reply with a flirty tone, \"Oh yea?\" He says, \"Yea...\" and winks at me. I lay him back on the couch and push his legs back up to his chest. His perfectly toned, bare white, ass is spread and I see his tight little asshole. He winks it at me and I dive in with my tongue and start eating his ass out. Kissing, licking, gently stroking his balls and sliding my fingers lightly over his penis. I stick one finger into his ass and start fingering him. He moans, \"Oh yea! Keep doing that hun.\" I push my finger up and find his prostate and start stimulating it and he lets out a deep, gutteral, moan, \"OHHH! MMMM, ya! ya baby! keep doing that! oh! OHH! OHH!\" and his body contracts, and I look up at his body and he shoots another cumshot up his stomach and chest.  \nI slllowly cat crawl on top of him and lick his cum off his body. He is deeply breathing again, I keep crawling up his body and start kissing his cheek, jaw, and neck. \"How was that baby?\" He whispers, \"So good baby.\" I whisper in a sultry tone, \"Can you go one more time? I would love to fuck you in the ass.\" He pauses, and whispers back in my ear, \"I'm down.... but go really slowly. I've never had a dick in my ass before.\" I moan back to him, \"I've never done this to a man either.\"   \nI stand up and start taking off my clothes. He props himself up with his elbows while still laying down on his back to watch me better. My top is off and my nipples are hard, I throw my shirt across the hall, and undo my pants. My 7 inch rock hard cock springs out and I tell him to flip over. While he is flipping over I am admiring his fit body, tight wash board abbs, muscular back, shoulders, and arms, and lastly - his gorgeous plump ass cheeks are just asking me to come slide my dick into it. I grab a handful of lube and lather it on my cock and balls. Any extra lube I start fingering it into his butt and he starts moaning.   \nI mount him while he is prone down on our ottoman and I plop my cock down inbetween his butt cheeks and smack his ass. He moans again and I slowly slide my tip into his asshole and he lets out a loud sigh! \"OOOoo! slowly! slooowwwwly!\" I pull back a little, then slowly advance it in again a little further. I keep repeating this until I am able to fit my cock half way in and now I start thrusting in and he starts moaning ,\"OH UH! UH! OH! YEA! MM! FUCK! YES! AHH! MMHMM! FUCK YES!\" \\*thrust thrust thrust thrust\\* I cannot believe I'm fucking my life long crush and best friend right here in my own house on my wife's ottoman! I can barely believe It and my hormones are raging. I feel so close to cumming, my balls start tingling, my stomach gets really light and my chest is opening up as I arch my back. I yell, \"Hey babe, I am about to cum!\" he moans, \"Cum inside me!\" I grab the back of his neck and grunt, \"beg me to cum in your ass and call me daddy!\" He moans, \"please cum in me daddy! fuck yes! empty your balls inside me.\" I sigh, \"Oh yea, 'atta boy.\" I thrust my cock all the way into his ass, my balls are hanging out of him, and I yell, \"FUCK! OHH! UGH! AHH! AHHHH! AHHHHHHH!\" I shoot multiple cumshots deep into his ass. He is moaning and panting.  I slap his ass and SUDDENLY-   \nI hear the front door lock twist, the door handle turns and the door opens. A rush of outside cold air flows in and my wife walks in. She looks up and sees me balls deep into my best friend, we both look with an 'OH SHIT' face, caught, her jaw drops, she drops her purse on the ground, and puts her hands over her mouth in shock.....  \nIf you want me to keep writing the rest of this story in a part 2, let me know by upping this and letting me know. Remember this is all a fantasy of my real life.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"gaystoriesgonewild","subreddit_id":"t5_2y1t6","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/gaystoriesgonewild","subreddit_subscribers":191068,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I (28M) am married to a woman, but have always fantasized about having sex with my gorgeous life long male best friend.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.95,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gaystoriesgonewild\/comments\/z99emm\/i_28m_am_married_to_a_woman_but_have_always\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I got sick of worrying about money after spending 5 years in the military and 7 as a paramedic. Nursing pays well and if I worked 4 twelves a week i could realistically make 120k without OT or nights added in. But nights suck and 12 hour shifts can eat your soul, especially since I have kids and my wife is also a BSN. So if I put time into school i would like to advance my salary as well because I don't mind working hard as long as I am compensated. So that led me to business and\/or administration and the choice between MHA or MBA. I think an MBA would be a good fit because my background is versatile and i adapt well to new things. \n\n\nI do love healthcare and i like caring for people but the way bedside is moving i can't see things getting better in the next 5-10 years without major change. Our ER is currently getting abused and all the older nurses complain that post COVID nursing is horrible, which is all I've known. \n\n\nSo I'm looking for any registered Nurses who made the jump to an MHA or MBA. I'm located in MN and would like to attend the U of M Carlson school of business or their public health college for the MHA. I've only lived in MN about 6 years and It seems  MN seems like it has lots of opportunities to utilize either an MBA or MHA. I also love it here.\n\nI have a Bachelor's of Science in Emergency Medical Services and I am shy about 30 credits of a BSN but do not want to waste time or money going to school for another bachelor's because it would take about 5 semesters to finish part time.\n\n\nI would post in r\/nursing but those people HATE MBAs and MHA lol and i completely understand. Some of those threads were not very helpful so I decided to post here. \n\n\nSo any advice or stories would be helpful or just nice to hear.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MBA","subreddit_id":"t5_2rbd9","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/MBA","subreddit_subscribers":175873,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Nurse looking to the future","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.88,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MBA\/comments\/z99est\/nurse_looking_to_the_future\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I don't drive yet, so my mom has had to drive me to campus (takes roughly hour and a half) roughly 17 times this semester. Actually, less than that as my stepfather has driven me a few times to take off her workload. Each and every time she drove me, she spent a good amount of time complaining about this and saying I should have looked into needing to be on campus before applying. Me being me, I've mentioned the fact that my mom hates driving me to school so exams are difficult to friends. And mentioned that she expects a lot from me, as she expects straight As, on top of handling the household chore, and I had a part time job at the time. When I say household chores, I mean handling pretty much the entire care of more than 10 cats (long story), sweeping, dishes, laundry, vacuuming, and mowing the lawn. This was a lot for me, so I did complain to a few friends about how this was too much, and she expected so much from me. Shortly before the event, I had left my part time job, so I had more free time. In this free time, I was... messaging a guy. NSFW stuff. Still, I'm 21 and it's not illegal. Anyways, one day my stepfather tells me to give him my phone. Since he paid for it, I gave it to him, but asked him to not go through my messages, as they were private. Yeah, no. He sent DOZENS of screenshots to my mom and a family friend that stays with us regularly. Apparently, I'm an asshole for complaining, as well as \"planning to sneak a boy over.\" Yeah, I talked about him coming over and us doing stuff. It was just like a fantasy. It wasn't going to happen, I'm too much of a chicken. And I keep getting shamed for the stuff I'm into. I could go into the shit I'm currently in for it, but I don't even think anyone could handle reading all of that in one post.

I’m currently looking for someone new for either a dating or FWB relationship. I live in the Sherman Oaks area of the SFV and I can host or travel. I would prefer not to have to travel too far. \n\nPhysically, I am 28 years old, white, 6’02”, thin, blue\/green eyes, with dirty blonde hair. I’m d\/d free, covid vaccinated with the booster, and HWP. I drink mostly socially but don’t smoke or use drugs. I don’t necessarily care if you do, but if you are looking for someone to smoke with I’m probably not your match. I work full time, exercise 4-5 days a week, and I do have a dog. I just like to throw that out there for anyone allergic or who has a strong dislike of dog hair. \n\nMy interests include movies, television, music\/concerts, games, sports, running\/hiking, coffee, bars, and hanging with friends. I am very into movies &amp; tv, especially horror. Currently playing the new God of War. Also very into music and have been wanting to find someone who enjoys going to concerts and finding new artists. Some of the artists I’m into right now are Weyes Blood, Angel Olsen, The Chats, Wednesday, and Alvvays. I do enjoy sports a lot, mainly baseball and football. Of course everyone in LA loves hiking but if you know any cool spots I’d love to check them out. I love exploring the city and trying out new places I haven’t been too especially new bars\/breweries! Any activity I can bring my dog to is a plus as well!\n\nAs far as kinks go I enjoy quite a few. I definitely enjoy the rougher side of sex, including spanking, bondage, and toys. I love oral, both giving and receiving. I am fairly open to trying new things so feel free to tell me what you like and dislike. I firmly believe that having a healthy sexual relationship is built on communication and trust and I understand that doesn’t happen overnight. Hard limits include any blood, scat, permanent harm\/changes to the body, etc.   \n\nThere’s definitely more I’d love to discuss and chat about! If any of my post resonated with you, shoot me a message and let’s chat. I am only looking for IRL with the intention of meeting up in person so if you are not comfortable with that just yet, no worries! If you need a conversation starter just let me know what you’ve watched recently or what music you like.

Up until puberty I never had any problem with being seen as a “girl”, after all I had XX chromosomes so I guess that’s what I am right? \nThen I started having to wear a bra and found myself wishing my breasts stayed tiny since I didn’t want to have noticeable breasts. I also had no desire to get my period and was disappointed when it came. And I always kind of hated when my mom said “your figure is starting to get womanly”. I don’t want to be “womanly”, something about that label makes me uncomfortable. \n\nHowever I don’t feel like a boy, at all. I’m defo not trasmasc. \n\nSo I wondered am I enby? But no, that’s not quite right either. I wouldn't have a problem being seen as genderless or they\/them so I guess that part fits. But if I had to choose between male and female I’d rather be female so I must have some leaning towards that side? Am I a demi girl?\n\nBut why would I chose female? Wel because... I like traits such as small, soft gentle voice, unnoticeable. I don’t like body hair, etc. so just generalized stuff and stereotypes. Also I think girls are prettier. \nI don't have some internalized feeling though telling me \"I am a girl\". \n\nWhat is gender even supposed to mean? \n\nAnd so then I think... if I have no internal \"gender\"... am I agender?\n\nAnd then I\"m like agghhh... what if I'm just subconsciously attention seeking or I'm just overthinking everything and I'm a cis girl? Multiple therapists have told me I'm likely autistic too which can apparently make it harder to figure out gender... so what if I'm misreading everything... \n\nBut I can't just be attention seeking. I don't WANT too much attention on me. I joined a random discord server recently and it asked for my pronouns and I was so tempted to type she\/her and be done with it because I didn't want to seem like an attention seeker. BUt then I typed they\/she and smiled since I felt more comfortable with it. \n\nAnd then wait, why do I keep thinking I\"m attention seeking for potentially not being cis? Do I have some internalized transphobia here without realizing?\n\nBasically though I can't figure out my gender... and maybe I'm the only one who can truly decide what it is in the end but I was hoping for opinions or insights...\n\nThank you if anyone actually read all of that XD","send_replies":false,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskLGBT","subreddit_id":"t5_2s4u1","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AskLGBT","subreddit_subscribers":24331,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Figuring out gender.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.94,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskLGBT\/comments\/z99vmj\/figuring_out_gender\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

All the things that made me feel shitty They're real and my reaction was totally valid. I was always very sensitive child (got diagnosed with autism and adhd later), got bullied for it and generally didn't cope. I was on SSRI and later SNRI close to half my life (I'm 20 started when I was 10, though tgere were breaks in between). They didn't made me feel better, more like numb.\n\nI also got on different meds to help my with anxiety (I simply couldn't fall asleep for a longest time - still have troubles with it), but the only one I remember is the one I took for last 2 years, which was pregabalin. It actually worked like intended, except no one mentioned possible side effects, or the fact that it's main purpose is treating epilepsy. I only learned that after I wanted to smoke some weed and decided to google if mixing them could be dangerous.\n\nI was also on ritalin for a few months. I hoped it will help me with my trouble with keeping focus - than I learned it doesn't help with focus, but with hyperactivity. But my hyperactivity was manageable, keeping focus was the problem. But apparently in my country they ALWAYS start with ritalin, and only switch to the other drug (don't remember name) that actually helps with focus if it fails. But like how the fact was it suppose to help? So it actually made me even less able to focus since I was tired all the time (since that's how you deal with hyperactivity).\n\nAnyway I was kinda planning to quit it (I already spent some time on this sub), and then one day I just forgot to take it, which made me feel like shit, but I just decided \"fuck it, let's do it\" and went cold turkey. I had a few days of intense muscle pain and cold sweats, but I managed.\n\nSomewhere around this time (don't remember before or after) I googled pregabalin and learned side effectes. One of them is problems with eye vision. Eyesight in my right eye has been worsening since I started taking it (although I only noticed in hindsight) - not drastically, but noticeable. Basicly I had problems with eyes but I was able to keep it (basically my eye muscle were able to compensate so I wans't feeling effects). And then they weren't. So I decided I needed to quit, so after the effect of ritalin withdrawal passed I quit them cold turkey too.\n\nSupprise it actually kinda hepled my ability to focus, since I wasn't in an antipepressant daze.\n\nBut people put insane amout of trust in psychiatry and psychology. My mother managed my therapy for most of my life (obviously, since I was a child). She is a medical doctor (not in psychiatry though) My first therapist was someone her friend recommended. Second was recomended by first. They kinda felt fishy a few times, but I convinced myself I'm overreacting.\n\nThen yo and behold we went to psychiatrist to try to get me new meds, and she asked where I go to therapy to check it out. Turns out, the first one (the one she googled) could only be found in a \"Christian psychologists\" group and didn't finish psychology. We didn't check the second, but I bet he was the same. I since found therapist that actually is licenced (and specialises in autistic adults, so that's good for me), but I spended I think somethinf like 4 years with those guys.\n\nAlso funny story about how I switched from SSRI to SNRI. Mum was on some sort of medical panel, and there was psychiartist speaking. She talked to him afterwards and described my situation, he asked her a couple of questions (one being whether I like sweets) and recomended I switch SSRI to SNRI and to switch pregabalin to something else. I think SNRI did improve my mentals state (at least innitially), though the pregabalin replacement made me basically faint after taking it, so I refused.\n\nFunny part is that in hindsight it might have been better than ANTI EPILEPTIC drug, since I literaly used it to be able to sleep, but my mom insisted I take it when she wanted (which was something like 2 hours before I wanted to actually go to sleep) which made me unable to function when I still wanted, so I refused to switch that one.\n\nBut like... the guy who never seen me in person felt confident to suggest drugs to me after what I assume was like 15 minute conversation with my mother. And she trusted him. And while what he suggested wasn't that bad... he probably could have suggested anything. Including antipsychotics or other really dangearous stuff. And she would have believed him. It makes my skin crawl.\n\nAnyway thank You all. Being able to actually experience emotions is nice, if not always pleasant, and understanding that I'm not a problem helps too. So thanks again everyone\n\nEdit.
