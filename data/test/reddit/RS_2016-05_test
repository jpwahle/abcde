Firstly I'm not entirely sure that this is the right subreddit, so if anyone knows anywhere this would be more suited, please direct me there! \n\nI'm 29f and my partner is 44m. We've been together about 8 months and I'm 3 months pregnant. Yes it's a little soon, it was an accident but a happy one.\n\nI've known my partner for about 5 years prior to us becoming a couple, and was partially aware of what he does for a living when we got together. Basically I was aware he was a glamour and fetish photographer, and aware that his job involved him being with other women, and I accepted it. I have never wanted another partner other than him (although I'm quite keen on watching him with others, or joining in.) The agreement we had was that he would tell me when he was going to sleep with another woman, and show me pics afterwards.\n\nI have since found out the extent of his work and I'm kind of struggling. I searched for, and found, his online profiles, without his knowledge. There have been hundreds of girls that I know about, most of his shoots have been in his home. Hundreds and hundreds of videos, all in the last 2 years. I wasn't aware there were so many. Also there are about 150 videos of him and his ex gf from a couple of years ago. Almost all the girls in the videos work in the adult industry, and about 90% are prostitutes. The videos are pay per view, which is how he makes most of his money.\n\nI'm kind of glad I know now, but I think with all the pregnancy hormones, and the fact that we've not had sex in 2 months (due to a medical issue on my part) has made me feel very insecure. We discussed this and he told me that he would stop screwing other women whilst I'm pregnant and struggling to accept everything. \n\nA few days ago, he put up some new videos on his profile. Of him and his ex gf. I couldn't believe he would betray my trust like that. I began to think I couldn't trust him to keep to an agreement. So I made a fake profile and contacted him asking him to make a video with me, which he readily agreed to. For free. \n\nI confronted him about all this, and he didn't think any of it was a problem. He told me he hadn't told me he was screwing his ex because I would be upset (correct!) and that it was purely business. He also says that happened before he told me he wouldn't fuck anyone. When it came to the fake profile, he told me 'we didn't set a date, I could have been planning to do it after the baby was here'. After the confrontation he did apologise, although I can tell he doesn't think he's done anything wrong. \n\nI don't really know what I'm doing here, I guess I just want some opinions- I literally have nobody that I'm able to talk to about all this. I'm worked up into a hormonal frenzy and don't know how to process all this. I don't think I'll ever be able to trust him again- but all this was never an issue before the pregnancy. I feel like I've opened Pandora's box and don't know how to make myself feel ok again. \n\n\n\n","domain":"self.polyamory","stickied":false,"over_18":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"permalink":"/r/polyamory/comments/4h6yuh/i_dont_know_if_what_my_partner_has_been_doing_is/","from_kind":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/4h6yuh/i_dont_know_if_what_my_partner_has_been_doing_is/","hide_score":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qu5n"}

Had a ton of progress, wrapping up with 335x4 on squats, 425x4 on deadlifts, and 200x5 on paused bench. All of which are PRs for me. Unfortunately (sorta) April 16-21 I was on a cruise ship celebrating my father's 60th birthday, which was the heaviest and lowest volume part of my peak. Given that I think the tail end of UHF didn't have enough volume I think I peaked too early. Came back and started grinding on 305lbs on squats, failed a 385lbs deadlift...it was just horrible. Two days out I was feeling better and pulled 405 fast, and benched 225 with a pause pretty smoothly so I decided to YOLO this meet. I sandbagged my openers and figured I'd just go by feel. As a result I had a TON of fun.

But somehow I recovered well this week and here I came in and SMOKED THIS LIFT.\n\n**187.5kg** - [Make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d1uO7Mkzrw&amp;list=PLP3cQVDywrt5xUOSu0Vwbq8YrC8FYbUSH&amp;index=8). 3 whites. Ties my best meet pull, and also a smoke show. Decided my next attempt would be a bit YOLO. \n\n**200kg** - [Miss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3Okx9Mx_M&amp;list=PLP3cQVDywrt5xUOSu0Vwbq8YrC8FYbUSH&amp;index=9). Grip. I missed my third pull at my last meet the same way. My calluses got soft on my cruise and I just didn't have the bar set in my hand. It's okay, speed tells me I have more in me IF I JUST HOLD THE DAMN BAR.\n\n**Summary**\n\n450kg total, which ties my last meet...which was a year ago almost exactly. But I'm lighter, and I recently switched to GZCL-training which has been way better. Considering this is after a week off and with no plan of attack and with a suboptimal peak...not terrible.\n\nNext meet is USAPL NJ States on August 5th. I'm registered as a 59kg lifter and hired a coach from Renaissance Periodization. I'm just outsized in both height and muscle at 66kg right now. I'm 5'2\", I need to cut and fill out my frame. Additionally, Cody Lefever has agreed to coach me into the meet and we begin Monday so I've got 14 weeks under the Cobra Commander himself.\n\nLessons learned - keep my hands healthy, work on grip, fix my shoulder asymmetry that makes my squats so weird looking, and everything will be good. \n","distinguished":null,"link_flair_css_class":"meet","id":"4h6zmh","quarantine":false}

I like playing videogames and going out in the weekends. I live in the Netherlands so please excuse me if my English is a bit off sometimes ;)\n\nSince I was little i have been introverted and the type of person who spends a lot of time inside his own head. I've always had trouble with connecting with the outside world and people.\nAbout a year ago I suffered from Psychoses and Depression. I have been undergoing treatment from a psychologist. I don't have a lot of symptoms of psychoses anymore luckily. I might still have a milder form of Depression though. But anyway because of my antidepressants I have had this numb feeling. So I started to find ways to suppress this feeling. Unfortunately I stared smoking weed now and then, Wich I think may have led to experiencing symptoms of Depersonalisation and or Derealisation. This also could maybe have come after my Psychoses, I don't know really. Everyday I feel like I'm not fully on earth anymore. I experience life like its a movie or a game. I doesn't feel like I'm alive anymore and everything around me is foggy and vague.\n\nI'm sick and tired of this fucking feeling. I have been in waves of fighting this, but because I'm falling behind with school I'm isolating myself even more. Now I'm fully devoting myself to fight. I'm taking steps towards exercising almost everyday. I'm putting myself out more by talking to strangers and falling flat on my face sometimes. Basically I'm just going to be truthful and more strict towards myself now. \nSo anyone who is experiencing something like this or anything similar or even something completely different, let's stand by each other and fight!  \nLet's just give each other advice, tips and motivation. Let's help each other by being the person who listens and who shows sympathy.\nI know I will stil have to do this on my own, but I feel like having reflection from other people and having support might help a lot.\nThe people who read this post and feel like they want to help or fight, don't hesitate to reply.\nI will also be able to talk through Skype if you wan't to share a story or just talk.

He's not the amazing sweet guy I thought I married..something changed or he lied for 8 years.

Is it true that nobody will want me? I mean, I take care of myself. I exercise, I eat right, I'm really a fun person. I have no kids..But because I'm 38, is all of that meaningless and no guy will ever love me? I've been so depressed since all this happened. He never had hurt me before, I thought we were amazing.

Mainly that I'm shallow when I used to look for a relationship, because I didn't mind any type of personality someone had and my interests were too obscure to have something in common with anybody I meet. I'm also narcissistic, which I'm sure you can tell judging from the amount of times \"I\" is iterated. Finding someone doesn't matter anymore though. I've completely given up on trying to find someone because I'm accustomed to being alone at this point and I'm sick of hearing that there's someone out there for me and various drivel such as that. I have low self esteem with how I look as well. Honestly the only thing keeping me alive, is the fact that I kept a promise to myself to complete all of my goals and leave some proverbial legacy for me and my father on this earth, which consisted of making a graphic novel I've been planning for since I was a kid and developing the story, making videos on YouTube, being competitive at hobbies I like such as SSBM, and making music. Every single one of them unrealistic and unobtainable, but I don't want to limit any of them and just stick to one. Years after years, day in and day out, I honestly see nothing changing and I'm slowly getting more tired of life. I apologize profusely about the long message by the way.","domain":"self.SuicideWatch","stickied":false,"over_18":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"from_kind":null,"permalink":"/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4h73c4/cant_stop_thinking_about_ending_it_all_for_the/","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4h73c4/cant_stop_thinking_about_ending_it_all_for_the/","hide_score":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qpzs","media_embed":{},"saved":false,"score":3,"from_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"locked":false,"retrieved_on":1466416150,"downs":0,"from":null,"gilded":0,"secure_media":null,"subreddit":"SuicideWatch","ups":3,"num_comments":1,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"author":"WaveKingCaesar","author_flair_css_class":null,"edited":false,"name":"t3_4h73c4","archived":false}

And also because she used to live alone. Not even three months after I move in, she gets diagnosed with lung cancer. I was the one who drove her to her appointments in the beginning and took care of her after her chemo days. I've got a lot of chronic health issues so trying to take care of her was pushing me way past my safety zone. \n\nLast Monday she had surgery. They cut her open and removed half her lung. Half her God damn lung. And for some stupid reason, they sent her home yesterday. She has all these other bad health problems on top of lung cancer. And they send her home not even a week after surgery. The stupid oxygen people didn't show up until 10:30 last night and she had ran out of the oxygen they gave her at the hospital. So that was traumatic. If my aunt and dad hadn't been there, I wouldn't have waited. I would've called 911 because I can not handle that shit.\n\nNow it's just me and my dad here with her. She has to be hooked up to oxygen 24/7 otherwise her levels drop down to 80 within a minute. She can't walk without the combination of a walker and at least one strong person to hold her. She keeps crying out in pain and keeps getting so out of breath just from sitting up or lying down. I am so afraid of something happening. \n\nWhat am I going to do when I'm the only one here with her next week? She's almost 100 pounds heavier than me. I am a petite woman. How am I supposed to put her on the toilet? How am I supposed to hold her up when she needs to move? I'm 20 years old. I do not have that level of life experience. I can barely take care of myself on my own. Honestly I could never live alone because of my health. My life now consists of going to work, and staying at home with her. I have been elected the caregiver, thanks to the cards life dealt. \n\nJust being in the same room as her makes me feel like breaking down crying and makes me nauseous and my heart starts going crazy. I feel like whenever I'm in the same room as her, I am actively fighting off a panic attack. Every time I check my phone at work, I almost throw up because I'm afraid of seeing a message that something happened. I do not know how to handle any of this. I do not think I am even capable of it. And I know that I am far FAR from the ideal choice for her to be living with. I can't take care of her like she needs. \n\nI've been relying on a combination of energy drinks during the day and a bunch of benadryl at night to get me through this. I know that's making it worse but I can't stay asleep at night and I can't focus during the day. I'm just really freaking out right now and need some advice or help please.

Prior to this I was kind of a bum because of the habits my parents instilled in me from growing up on welfare. And a girlfriend from high school who lived off of(and still does) her parents. Something kind of snapped me into action because I was sick of living like that so I got myself a full time job. It wasn't the $525 a month in welfare I had been getting and it tore a rift between me my parents, sisters, aunt, and girlfriend because they had lost their control over me. Misery loves company. I lost a lot of respect for myself and everyone else I knew for how I lived before. The new job at $15/hr was the kick to the face I needed. Everything changed for the better. \nI learned new skills, how to drive a forklift, handle cash, picked up new computer skills on the fly,improved my communication skills, and learned a slew of shit about the products my employer sells.\n \nMy first year of working I lost over 100lbs, went to the gym, got an actual vehicle to drive. Except I felt out of place somehow. I wasn't very good with my money initially maxxed out my first credit card. Had no savings and just humped it paycheck to paycheck trying to pay rent, keep my bills paid, and have money aside to see friends. Paychecks disappeared pretty quickly. 50% to rent 25% to debt and bills I was almost living like I was when my mother made me go on welfare. Not to say I wasn't having fun or enjoying my life. There was just no savings. Jeans t-shirt and camping with a six pack on a weekend was me(and possibly an amassment of Warhammer figurines). But the last couple of years changed radically. \n\n2 years ago I got promoted at work. I went from seeing $1200 a paycheck to $1600 a paycheck working an office gig. But for some reason I was really fucking good at what I did, I was everyones go to for information. It never clicked that everyday I slaved away at work previously I was learning something new. Never forsaw it transforming into the position that I was in. Everything changed. I started buying nicer clothes. Moved in with a friend to save on rent($675 vs $1200) got rid of my car and stuck to transit. Finally had income mobility as they call it. Well that is until November 1st. On November 1st I took over a management position and had no expectations on salary. Not once in my life did I think I was worth this. But fuck me it happened and I'm still in shock and don't know what to do.\n\nYesterday on the train I wrote out how much I take home a month now and what my expenses are.\n\n$6803 take home for the month.\n\n-$675 for rent\n-$124 for a 2-zone bus pass\n-$60 for a pre-paid phone with data\n-$50 for high speed telus internet\n-$40 for a gym membership\n-$400 for food\n-$400 for clothing\n-$50 eating out\n-$50 Netflix &amp; movie rentals\n-$50 for steam games\n\nMy work pays for my health and dental plans as well. I put down roughly what I've spent in a month since November and 1/3 of that was on a single shopping trip for Arteryx winter gear. I don't drink very much anymore. And I don't eat out except for when I'm out of coffee at home and go to mcdonalds or if I have no other choice. But on average I have $4950 a month I don't spend.\nCurrently my savings account has $33,328 in it. My work pension acct is near $24,000 give or take the market and my puny RRSP is only worth $4200. \n\nWhat the hell should I be doing? I've never had this kind of money before in my life. Shopping at Winners for polo shirts or buying my date dinner last Thursday(yeah I hit it) feels so fucking alien to me. I'm so accustomed to living a shitty mediocre life that I'm too scared to start spending or living more. I booked a week off work for the May long weekend and my boss asked me where I was going. I have no fucking clue where I'm going. I never even considered any of this a possibility.

It is a ton of fun even though I can barely do anything but cruise and push, and after going beyond my limits I have really come to decide I need to get super comfortable with the basics before I hurt myself more.\n\nAny tips on foot position when going between standing and pushing?  I noticed that mine is/was terrible and I tend to make my board go left and right while I push then I am okay when cruising.  The last few times I tried focusing on keeping my foot centered on the board when pushing and not moving it to keep myself more stable (using my rear foot to steer).  This resulted in a huge increase of confidence, stability, speed, and keeping myself in a straight line when pushing.\n\nWhen snowboarding or surfing I am regular, although the more I look at skateboard videos and think about it, I am not sure if I should be regular on skateboard.  Trying to push goofy for the first time it felt like my very first time on a skateboard (unstable, bad balance, weak leg).  The reason I think I might have an easier time goofy is mostly because I tend to unconsciously approach my board from the left which causes me to readjust or trip up.\n\nShould I just practice goofy and regular until I feel confident skateboarding both ways before I try to determine which is for sure for me?  I never had this thought or issue snowboarding regular.  Skateboards seem harder than surfing or snowboarding but that might just be my experience.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NewSkaters/comments/4h76ns/foot_placement_and_stance_tips_anyone_switch_from/","over_18":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"permalink":"/r/NewSkaters/comments/4h76ns/foot_placement_and_stance_tips_anyone_switch_from/","from_kind":null,"hide_score":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2tqri","media_embed":{},"score":3,"saved":false,"author_flair_text":null,"locked":false,"from_id":null,"downs":0,"from":null,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1466416193,"secure_media":null,"subreddit":"NewSkaters","ups":3,"num_comments":2,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"author":"PinkiePaws","author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_4h76ns","edited":false,"archived":false}

I'm 18 and I feel lonely. Not sure where this all began, but man is it starting to take its toll on me. Please excuse me, my head is spinning in 300 different directions as I'm writing this and I'm unable to focus (I cant write this in any chronological order).\n\nGoing to school I do my best to be happy and smile - or at the very least make people think I am (and I think many people are buying into this act). I'd hate to portray myself as \"that person who kills the mood with his negative energy\". In order to do this, I try to add to peoples conversation with a quick joke or something of sorts. And while this has proven successful numerous times, my ability to talk 1 on 1 with someone is deteriorating (just to give a full picture of my situation: I'm *not* socially akward). Where does that leave me? I rarely get someone to message me, or coming up to talk to me... just because it's me. I've lost what I once considered a good - maybe even best - friend. Why? Because people moved on to people more interesting. I've become so uninteresting that even I wouldn't want to hang out with me. \nI specifically remember one time on my 18th birthday. Me and the rest of my class were on a field trip in the nation's capital. We agreed to celebrate my birthday by going out, so we planned to do so after having dinner. As dinner came and passed, I decided to leave for 2 minutes to take a phone call from my parents wishing my a happy birthday. After the call had ended I walked back, only to find that *everybody* had left. 30 people had left. I called them to understand what was going on. The answer hurt more than had I been tortured for an eternity: **They forgot me**. On my birthday. *30* people forgot me on my birthday - 18th birthday. I have never struggled to get through a day without crying like I did that day, instead I just tried to stay as silent and anonymous as possible. I felt so fucking miserable that even thinking back on it tears me up. Why? Because it just cemented the fact that I'm so deprived of charisma that I can be considered irrelevant on *my own fucking birthday*. And recently, after convincing myself that \"it's gonna be different this time\", that same thing happens when going out. I can't keep up an interesting conversation for the life of me, and I just end up spending the night watching other people have fun in silence, only to be interupted once or twice with the question \"Are you upset?\". Better yet (this is a personal favorite of mine) I'll get the \"hey dude, can you go home? You're kind of killing the mood\".\n\nYou know what I feel is the best part? I don't blame anyone. While I want to yell at the top of my lungs at them, telling them how they destroy me on a day to day basis, I am in no way entitled to do so. How life is forming is a direct result of the choices one makes, so nor am I resorting to self-pity or blaming others. But I do wanna let everyone know - to whom it may or may not concern - that shit like this *hurts*. It hurts A LOT. \n\nBeing this lonely has made me numb when it comes to family. I've grown more distant towards my parents, and felt absolutely no grief after hearing of my aunt's cancer or my grandfathers death. Furthermore it's put my life at a standstill. I don't do anything that would require time and patience (i.e music or drawing), I don't travel to meet family, I just don't do anything really. All because I don't feel like there is anything or anyone to come home to.\n\nI don't know what I hope to achieve with this post. \"Emotional support\" doesn't really faze me. I also don't know why I decided to write this life-rant now. Perhaps because with 2 months of school left, I'm too anxious about having absolutely no one to talk to afterwards. Or maybe because following yesterdays prom, I got to re-experience the feeling of going out - the feeling of loneliness. Heck, maybe I'm just too stubborn to realize that all I crave is little bit of attention, a little \"hey we know you exist\" kind of thing? I'd usually just let this feeling - of \"supposed (?)\" loneliness subside by telling myself \"come on man, pull it together\" to the point of which it didn't bother me *as much*. Because, in the end, the people that really need help are the ones that had to experience a real life trauma (god bless them, I wish them all the best), and not some whiny teenager like myself... And yet, in spite of all this, something still compels me to post this.","stickied":false,"domain":"self.depression","permalink":"/r/depression/comments/4h79j9/lonely/","from_kind":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"over_18":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4h79j9/lonely/","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqqf","hide_score":false}

I was and am super excited about it. Everyone who works there is around my age and it's a relaxed and casual environment that has the feel of a start up even though it's a pretty well established company. My position isn't exactly the field I was originally interested in getting into (it's like customer support), but I thought I might as well do it since it's a company I've been wanting to work at for a while. It's also worth noting that technically i'm being employed here as a contractor under a contract that's set for 3 months (probably so the company doesn't need to provide benefits, etc.), but they assured me that they've pretty much extended everyone's contracts there and that could definitely be an option for me at the end of the 3 months.

I get that they were undrafted, so no one is really beating down the door to sign them, but it would seem like if every team is given the greenlight to call UDFA's at the same time, there could be a lot of confusion and players not having a chance to see what other teams are interested in them. I assume lots of these kids don't have agents too.\n\nIf I'm 21, dedicated my life to football, and just didn't get drafted, I'm probably going to say yes to the first team that calls, but that kind of sucks if you do that before learning that another team that's a better fit for you is interested too.","distinguished":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"id":"4h7ck8","quarantine":false,"hide_score":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qmg3","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/4h7ck8/signing_udfas/","secure_media_embed":{},"over_18":false,"from_kind":null,"permalink":"/r/nfl/comments/4h7ck8/signing_udfas/","media":null,"title":"Signing UDFA's","created_utc":1462069068,"thumbnail":"self"}

As a result, this VP was terminated, although she is still on board as our Finance consultant. I now report directly to the President. And I got many of the admin duties dumped on me when the VP left (I am the Executive Assistant). We are a small nonprofit with 12 employees. One of the things that happened was that verbal promises made to me in the interview/hiring process by the terminated VP have not been honored (pay raise at 6 months, flexibility in workday if I make up hours). All of the employees in the company come and go at will, or work from home, under an exempt status. I am the only non-exempt employee, and work a straight 8-hour day with no lunch break, and am required to be in the office. I have been informed by the President that if I choose to take a lunch break (which I seldom do), I have to get it preapproved, in writing, and make the time up (which I do). I also get PTO to use, which has to be approved in writing in advance. The problem is that the President called me after receiving a one-day request for PTO from me. She stated that \"she is concerned about the time I'm spending away from my desk and how it might impact other employees who have to answer the phone or the door.\" I am seldom away from my desk so this is a \"thin air\" statement. She further added that she would prefer I take my PTO \"a week at a time versus a day at a time.\" I like to take 3-day weekends, or use my PTO for events that come up with my college-aged students who live away from home. I don't want to take my PTO a week at a time, and there's nothing in the Employee Manual that states PTO must be used a week at a time. When I questioned why I must take it a week at a time, her response was, \"I'm just concerned that if you don't take a week off, you will get burnt out.\" This is ridiculous. How can she dictate what may or may not burn me out? Furthermore, when I addressed the raise that never happened, she said that since I didn't have the foresight to get it in writing, it won't be happening. I told her that either she doesn't believe me, which means she doesn't trust me, or she believes me and chooses not to honor it, which means she doesn't value me. Her response was, \"You are making more than the last person made. You are making the salary I'm comfortable paying you. We are a small nonprofit, and many of our grants didn't come through this year.\" So I feel I was dangled a carrot to come on board, and then told \"too bad.\" Additionally, I have lupus, which I have disclosed to my employer. I missed a 3-day period once in the past 9 months due to a lupus flare (which coincided with my grandmother's death in January). I used 1.5 days PTO available to me, and was forced to take LWOP for 1.5 days. This was another point she addressed. She said, \"I'm concerned you will go into LWOP again if I allow you to take a PTO day for pleasure when you might need it for your health issues.\" She added, \"Do you believe that I need to make an accommodation for you?\" I explained that I didn't need an accommodation--I am not only doing my job, but the job of her terminated VP. I told her that, overall, I manage my lupus very well. I reiterated that the period of my grandmother's death was very stressful--I managed her affairs, was with her when she died, planned her funeral and was trying to finalize her affairs. And I got sick, as everyone in our organization has done at some point with something since I've worked there. I manage my lupus very well with medication and lifestyle. I don't want the President being \"preemptive\" about whether I will have another flare in the future or not, and denying my earned PTO to me based upon her \"future making.\" I merely wanted to be able to take a day off so I can have a mini-vacation with PTO that I have earned. I also want to occasionally be able to take a lunch break, like all of the exempt employees do EVERY DAY without having to ask permission or make up time. I make up my lunch break whenever I am away from my desk for lunch. All of this feels like retaliation for being a whistleblower on the VP. I was not the only one who reported on the VP and her HR violations, but I am the one who started the conversation rolling. Furthermore, I feel that I am being devalued on many levels, and have decided to seek employment elsewhere. How am I going to be able to accommodate interviews if I am being watched so diligently? I was told that when I was hired (of course, none of this was in writing) that I could have a bit of flexibility now and then to allow for appointments, etc., as long as I made up my time. After this meeting on Friday, that doesn't feel like an option. Our President hired an HR firm, and they will on onboard this month. I don't know if I should let them know of some of the struggles I'm having, or if this will automatically label me as a \"problem\" employee with them. I am an amazingly bright woman and hard worker. I retired from the military and worked for the federal government for 20 years. The nonprofit world, which I entered to be a \"do-gooder,\" seems to be a completely different world unto itself. Promises are made and broken, rules are non-existent and then pulled from thin air when the person speaking feels like making them, etc. I'm 55 and while I'm not fearful about finding another job, I'm realizing that it's not as easy as it was when I was younger. A lot of what I'm experiencing feels like she is trying to make me miserable so I will move on. I feel that she will continue to \"have talks\" with me about things that are ridiculous and unwarranted. I'm in the state of Kansas in the United States.

I've been lurking around for a while and finally decided to purchase Kratom. I've only had it once previously several years ago and had a great experience. It was a pre made shot from a head shop that I threw back before work, and I just remember this amazing feeling of euphoria and energy and couldn't believe how much I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it so much that next time, I bought two shots and threw them both back, but puked due to way too much kratom. I have no idea the strain or dose, just remember it was like $15 a shot so I was done after puking $30.\n\nSo I just recently bought a few strains: a green Malay, red maeng da, and Bali Gold. Thursday I T&amp;W a TSP of green malay with grapefruit juice. I felt maybe some warmth and got some vision \"fuzz\" 45 min in, and that lasted about an hour. \n\nFriday morning, I T&amp;W 1 tsp of the Red Maeng Da with grapefruit juice and brought some extra to work. I waited an hour and dosed another .5 tsp every hour on the hour trying to find the \"sweet spot.\" I got to 3 tsp total and ran out, and really didn't feel a whole lot. Some more minor warmth and vision fuzz again, which is why I continued to up the dose every hour. Two hours after my last dose something hit me like a ton of bricks. I got hot and sweaty and nauseous and definitely felt the analgesic properties. I went home from work and \"slept\" it off, and after a few hours I felt better but the analgesia stayed for a few more hours.\n\nToday I woke up and threw back 1.5 TSP of the green Malay around 9 AM. Again, I did not feel a whole lot. I felt some clean stimulation, a little vision fuzz, but that was it. I waited until 8 PM to try the Bali Gold and tried 1.5 TSP. Same results, a little stimulation, vision fuzz, and some minor nausea. \n\nIs there something I am doing wrong? Does it take a few times for your body's receptors to get used to it? I have no experience with opioids. I am 5'10\", 195ish lbs, and pretty built (workout a lot). My alcohol tolerance is probably a little higher than normal. I know the stuff I bought isn't bad because I have spoken to some redditors who have kratom out of the same batch and like it.

Not bad, but not the euphoria and stimulation I remember and read about on the forums.  Does it sometimes take longer for some people than others?

The internship is at a major Bay Area firm where the dress code is \"casual\" (from what I understand this implies business casual OR a step below). Here are the considerations that are making it difficult for me to decide what to get:\n\n1. I feel uncomfortable in shoes that are long and/or large, like Wingtips, and I'd like to avoid anything flashy, so loafers / penny loafers appeal to me as a good style choice.\n\n2. I don't own any nice dress shoes (for formal events), just a $60 pair of Rockports. Hence, I like the idea of buying a pair of [Allen Edmonds Cavanaughs](http://www.allenedmonds.com/shoes/mens-shoes/dress-shoes/cavanaugh-penny-loafers/50025-085-3E.html?utm_source=cse&amp;utm_medium=google&amp;utm_campaign=50025-085-3E&amp;CAWELAID=520006330000195339&amp;CAGPSPN=pla&amp;CAAGID=22449920099&amp;CATCI=aud-106330622459:pla-156619198619&amp;catargetid=520006330000352515&amp;cadevice=c&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwr5G5BRD_n-T0pf7x4ucBEiQAlxHOPzMTeM6DfqDmJ1bqXl5nvsCK6QYfgM_eU69MGztlk5saAu2l8P8HAQ) or [Waldens](http://reviews.allenedmonds.com/7512-en_us/SF42470/walden-penny-loafers-reviews/reviews.htm?sort=helpfulness), which would also go well with chinos or jeans.\n\n3. I'm very hesitant to buy shoes as nice and expensive as the above two, since I'm not sure how long they'd last if I wore them every day for 10 weeks, and I'd hate to wear them out at my first internship (especially one with a low-key dress code).\n\n4. I don't own any casual slipons, and I like the idea of getting Sperry [Gold Cup Kennebunks](http://www.sperry.com/en/gold-cup-kennebunk-asv-venetian-loafer/10639M.html?dwvar_10639M_color=10847061) or [Hampden Venitians](http://www.sperry.com/en/hampden-penny-loafer/16177M.html?dwvar_16177M_color=STS10721#cgid=men-shoes-loafers-mocs&amp;start=1). Shoes like these would be great for clubbing and nights out, when sneakers don't suffice. Unfortunately, even if these loafers are acceptable at my work, I'm afraid they might be leaning toward the informal side, and I feel like it's better to err on the formal side.\n\n5. Sperry [Essex Penny Loafers](http://www.sperry.com/en/essex-penny-loafer/16165M.html?dwvar_16165M_color=STS10201&amp;ref=essex#q=essex&amp;start=1) seem to be a solution, but I'm not sure whether they're nice enough to wear with a suit to formal events, or suitable for clubbing and casual wear.\n\nDoes anyone know of a pair of shoes that might solve my dilemna? My budget is roughly $275, but I'd like to make purchases that will last me for some time.\n\nEDIT: little things","stickied":false,"domain":"self.malefashionadvice","preview":{"images":[{"source":{"width":620,"height":620,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/kB-Jg4KQWRBA3-JkMoSz5QLDCo6XhDXyt-Oqa2Gag_8.jpg?s=e289394831cca8274c162238cede1d39"},"id":"qixJ2ZfUgpY9UzFQ97C7qghXARL4rEYkQojr3Cn0QSA","resolutions":[{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/kB-Jg4KQWRBA3-JkMoSz5QLDCo6XhDXyt-Oqa2Gag_8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=f97694a64e909436ebff0811eb0309f4","height":108,"width":108},{"height":216,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/kB-Jg4KQWRBA3-JkMoSz5QLDCo6XhDXyt-Oqa2Gag_8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=033376b0d0b54dfff9897cf962433a9f","width":216},{"width":320,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/kB-Jg4KQWRBA3-JkMoSz5QLDCo6XhDXyt-Oqa2Gag_8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=6e12ec86a5b448143e48e0b9e011fccb","height":320}],"variants":{}}]},"thumbnail":"self","title":"Got a summer internship, and now I need nice shoes.

From reading reviews &amp; attempting to do some research on my own, I have found that there are varying opinions on which state is the \"best\" to get the ID from. On idgod's FAQ they stated that all IDs are good but South Carolina is better. On the contrary, from doing some research of my own I have found that people frequently stated that Connecticut and New Ohio IDs were in fact idgods best IDs.\nThat being said, I figure maybe providing some background information on my dilemma will help me get an answer as to what ID will be best for me. When it comes to using the ID with my younger friends who are college age, I am not concerned. My main concern is that I would like to go to the bar with some coworkers who are all over the age of 21 with real IDs of course. All of their IDs are Maryland IDs with the exception of one person who has a Pennsylvania ID. From what I've read I should not purchase a Maryland ID for in state use because bouncers will know what flaws to look for. One of my concerns is looking too suspicious by having an out of state ID while all of my coworkers will have in state ones (I plan to say that I attend college in MD). Also, my coworkers are varying ages from mid 20s to early 30s. Though I am younger, I can easily pass for 21 but 22 or 23 would be pushing it. Will having an ID that is not only out of state but says I am 21 exactly while my coworkers are varying ages make me look even more suspicious? Maybe I'm thinking too far into this. Given the info I provided, any advice on what state I should get to look the least suspicious for use in Maryland will be extremely helpful.

About 10 feet diameter. .floating above Grove street about 10 feet of the ground, I couldn't figure out wat it was I didn't think of a space ship or aleins at the time I just watched it..hover, . Then it got even brighter like the sun, i felt heat one my exposed skin.. I got really scared at that point but I couldn't move...I felt frozen sitting up in bed facing the object in the window, then I felt a tingling sensation all over me I looked down at my chest and noticed  small ant like insects?  But they were metallic about the size of ants but looking mire like tiny rectangles,. They were crawling all over me my legs face chest and arms and I could not move I was terrified! !. Just then the\" robot ants\" disappeared into thin air all at the same time the light dimmed and I could move again but for some reason  I layed back down and pulled the covers over my head, the voice was no longer there but I  felt a presence in the room with me I was petrified I began to think that I got to get to my mom's room quik!! But I was so afraid of what ever was in the room with me that I was really having a hard time getting the courage to do it..finally I gathered enough guts to throw the covers off and jump up to my feet I looked at the window there were 4 beings just like the so called greys in the middle of the street they all turned and looked at me all at the same time and  in 1 split second one of them was at my window staring at me it's movement was so fast I could not see it move from the street to my window I freaked out screamed and started to turn and run when I heard a crash in my closet, ,at that point I wasn't sticking around for the next suprize...I high tailed it down the hall through the kitchen jumping over the couch and straight into my mom and step dad's room..dad not to happy at this point but mom new I was really upset so she gave me a blanket and pillow and I laid down on the floor next to their water bed . A was feeling calmer and started to fall asleep then I heard somthing in the room...I screamed  mom!! mom!! but they didn't wake up I said it louder neither of them woke up, I heard shuffling in the room and then a bang against the  water bed I looked down towards the foot of the bed and suddenly a big ugly insect like head popped out it was crawling on the floor at the foot of the bed....and that is where it all started...thanks for listening.

I am considering the possibility of pursuing training as a doula later this year in order to help out my local community and lower income families in my area. I suppose my question is, how many of you would legitimately consider hiring a doula/have one assisting you now? How important do you personally believe this work is?\n\nHere's the deal: I'm 20 years old, going on 21. I have been through a bit of college and it was not the right place for me at the time and I have been trying to figure out what I want to do with my life since. I have always been fascinated by birth and pregnant women and it bothers me that families are not always given access to birthing options that are right for them. I believe that giving birth is probably the most incredible feat the human body can perform and it saddens me that it is not always viewed/treated as such. I recently learned that my home state of Louisiana has the highest c-section rate (40% versus the WHO recommended rate of 15%) in addition to having the lowest breastfeeding rate. The possibility of doing something to bring positive change gives me a lot of excitement.\n\nI am interested in assisting all cisgender, trans, LGBQT and nonbinary folks in a way that is right for them. I am not one of these people that is willing to put personal preference for natural birthing over safety, and I would like to think that I will have the necessary judgement to understand when medical intervention is necessary (as I understand it, doulas are generally not certified to give medical advice but I have read some horror stories about midwives putting mothers and infants in dangerous situations because of their own personal preference and I would never want to do that).\n\nMy demeanor is very patient and calm, and I tend to work well under pressure or in crisis situations. I'm good at calming people and I'm very empathetic. This plan is in its early stages (I was sitting around musing about what my qualities are and what areas of work they would be good for and birth work popped into my mind) but I almost feel as though it might just be the right calling for me for the time being.\n\nAny advice or relevant personal experience would be appreciated, from bumpers or current professional birth workers.

I can clean up when I like, and do enjoy wearing a tie and all that, but my go to style is generally childish. I feel a little conflicted...like I kind of want to change my style to be more grown up so that others see me as such, but I also have always been the type of person that's like \"I'm not gonna change for anybody!\" and still feel that way.\n\nWas just wondering if anybody else thought about this too.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4h7q1z/anybody_else_feel_like_their_personal_stylewhat/","over_18":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"from_kind":null,"permalink":"/r/asktransgender/comments/4h7q1z/anybody_else_feel_like_their_personal_stylewhat/","hide_score":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4b9"}

I am going to get tested next week on my day off, but I really just want some input to clear my mind in the meantime...\n\nFor some background, I am 18 years old and have only had sex once with one guy last summer. We met on Grindr and he seemed like a nice guy. We met up, and me being the na\u00efve gay that I am didn't worry about him using a condom because I was a virgin and he promised he was clean (again na\u00efve, and take partial responsibility). \n\nFast forward a couple months and I create a Grindr again and I see a faceless profile on Grindr meeting all the stats of the guy I hooked up with and then I see he identifies as \"Poz\". So I look up what that term means and my heart drops. I don't even know what to think and my mind is going at a hundred miles an hour, but maybe, just maybe it wasn't him. I had no photo yet since I had just created the profile and it was still being verified and so I ask him for a face pic and sure enough it's him. The same guy who I had unprotected sex with about a year prior. \n\nWhen I told him who I was he blocked me, and it took me creating another account and some name-calling on his part that I was just a hoe looking to blame it on someone and how it's illegal for me to be in his business (what does that even mean). He told me he's known for three years now and that he is undetectable and has been taking antiretrovirals since he's known, and that his HIV status doesn't matter because it's practically gone. Still, we had sex without a condom and he finished inside me (again, na\u00efve, and I still blame myself for being so stupid). Just for the sake of keeping my mind at ease, what are the actual chances of transmission when he's undetectable yet doesn't use a condom?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/4h7r9h/just_to_clear_my_mind/","permalink":"/r/gaybros/comments/4h7r9h/just_to_clear_my_mind/","from_kind":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"over_18":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2tdzg","hide_score":false,"media":null,"thumbnail":"self","created_utc":1462076919,"title":"Just to clear my mind..."}
