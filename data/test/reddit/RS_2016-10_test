We were VERY on and off for 5 years, we have both slept with multiple people and have never stopped having a physical relationship with each other for more than a couple months. We had a beyond thriving sex life for almost 6 years,  granted very unhealthy.\n\nWe have been livjng together and dating exclusively for 4 years. For the last 3 or so years, my boyfriend no longer wants to have sex. He has used every excuse in the book: he's tired, he's drank too much, he feels too pressured, he just doesn't have a high sex drive anymore, I need to initiate (I stopped after a while because I was sick of being rejected). He is adamant that he is still attracted to me and it has nothing to do with me. The kicker is, he regularly looks at a LOT of porn and has developed a specific attachment to one porn star (constantly downloading her porn, weekly for the last year) i have caught him on cam girl sites. When we broke up for three months, he immediately went on tinder and began talking to an ex, in an attempt to get laid. I have talked to him many times about this and say how degrading and hurtful it is that he'd rather do all that than be intimate with me. He always apologizes and says he will try harder to be physical and less \"lazy\" ( his most recent claim Is it's just easier to look at porn to get off. Gee thanks.) but never does. We have this conversation on a regular basis and i still get fucked only twice a month. I got diagnosed with cancer in January and have completed 6 months of treatment. I thought a near death experience might fix us. It did for a very short time, but within 3 months everything was back to normal. So, now I'm 20 lbs heavier from steroids, have extremely short hair that I'm very self conscience of, I can lo longer smoke cigarettes or weed (I loved both dearly) and haven't been able to drink for almost a year. So basically this is the worst year of my life and i have NO vices.  I feel so alone, sad, self conscience and exhausted..... and he's still jerky it on a regular basis to random girls online and reluctantly/awkwardly having sex with me maybe twice a month. I've hit the end of my rope. I've never felt so hideous and unwanted in my life. I look in the mirror and just don't see what is SO unattractive about me that you'd rather imaginary fuck girls online instead of the person you supposedly love. I've just never been so depressed. It's honestly just gotten to the point where I wish he'd just go off and stick his dick in a real girl, so at least then he'd be choosing a real person over me. I've never felt so dead inside. \nI don't know what to do anymore. I just truly believe he thinks I'm disgusting and would rather think about the girls online (that look absolutely nothing like me).\n","distinguished":null,"quarantine":false,"id":"55atyg","media":null,"created_utc":1475280115,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author":"Jujujustforthis","subreddit":"DeadBedrooms","name":"t3_55atyg","spoiler":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_text":null,"archived":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"locked":false,"edited":false,"contest_mode":false,"num_comments":26,"secure_media":null,"domain":"self.DeadBedrooms","thumbnail":"self","permalink":"/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/55atyg/bf25_of_10_years_chooses_porn_over_me26/","score":21,"title":"Bf(25) of 10 years chooses porn over me(26)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/55atyg/bf25_of_10_years_chooses_porn_over_me26/","link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1480187837,"ups":21}

Also I'm on a waiting list for a counsellor so until they get back to me talking to one isn't an option.\n\nThis isn't completely trans related but suicide is slowly coming to be the only way I see my life ending, I feel like I will end up committing suicide at some point but I really don't want to. Here are the main reasons why:\n\n1) I feel like no matter what happens with transition I will have missed most of my youth (I'm 18 almost 19 now) hating myself due to only realising I was trans about a year ago, having started hormones about 5 months ago and being unable to comfortably go 'full time' for probably a year. \n\n2) Within my group of friends, which is weird in the way it works, I am only really close to 2 of them and slightly close with another 2, with the rest only being friends by association. I feel uncomfortable around quite a few of them but because group events I frequently hang out with them. The group often feels very upset with people when they do something and don't invite everyone (i.e. If I had a day out with the 2 I'm close to everyone else would probably be upset they weren't invited) although it's getting better.\n\n3) The majority of my friends are on a gap year and looking to go to uni next year. I don't want to go to uni and study again and am looking to do an apprenticeship for software development (would love to work making games or in esports). When next year comes I feel like I'm going to feel very lonely as they'll all go and make new friends and I'll be left on my own. One of my closest friends is studying in the city we live however my parents are looking to move about a half hour away and I don't think anyone will come and visit (except the 2 closest friends but even then idk). I'm very afraid of being alone, so many people in my family are lonely (don't have many friends and are unhappy about it) and I don't want to end up the same.\n\n4) To add on to the lonely feeling, I've only kind of had a relationship but it wasn't very long and nothing really happened but I only met her through school like my friends. Now I'm no longer going to go to school I have no idea how I'm going to meet any new friends or people to date (especially because I'm closeted and don't really have an eta on when I'd come out fully it's not really fair to get into a relationship knowing this.) and the fact I feel like I don't have many meaningful friends and that I don't have a partner and with the majority of people I'm in contact with will be leaving/I'll be leaving I feel like I'm going to end up really lonely.\n\n5) I don't really feel motivated to do anything with life. I feel like I lost so much of my youth being depressed and not knowing why I hated myself I never got into sports/skills/clubs and I feel like I missed out so much. I kinda wanna play sports but my anxiety is a lot worse and the idea of changing and playing alongside loads of men makes me feel very uncomfortable. Also because I wouldn't have been playing sports since I was young there is no way I'm gonna be really good/great at it and if I'm not going to be anywhere near the best what's the point? I'm pretty good at league of legends and it'd be my dream to be a pro but I'm nowhere near good enough. Even if I was I doubt I'd be able to cope mentally. I also don't think I'd be able to practice enough to get there.\n\nAdding this all up, if I'm going to end up being more lonely and isolated, still unmotivated to do anything meaningful and maybe having missed the boat on being one of the best at something it feels like suicide is inevitable? Please help me I really want to be better, less lonely and feel like I can actually achieve my dreams even though I probably won't.\n\nReally sorry for the really long post but thanks if you read it all, on mobile so sorry for any formatting/grammatical issues.\n\nEdit: I might fall asleep as it's quite late where I am, so if I don't respond for a few hours that's why xx\n\n","distinguished":null,"quarantine":false,"id":"55ayls","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4b9","media_embed":{},"downs":0,"gilded":0,"stickied":false,"hide_score":false,"retrieved_on":1480187915,"ups":6,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":"questioning","is_self":true,"score":6,"link_flair_text":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/55ayls/suicidal_thoughts_getting_worse/","title":"Suicidal thoughts getting worse","num_comments":4,"secure_media":null,"edited":1475283183,"contest_mode":false,"permalink":"/r/asktransgender/comments/55ayls/suicidal_thoughts_getting_worse/","domain":"self.asktransgender","thumbnail":"self","over_18":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":"19, e since 19/04/16 girl? agender? nb? idk","secure_media_embed":{},"archived":false}

[Here's my match history as him.](http://www.dotabuff.com/players/37962491/matches?hero=morphling)\n\nOkay, okay, I'm not really playing him *wrong* but I know I'm not really doing an optimal job. I'm not 100% sure where to keep my agi/str at during many points of the game. I don't want to get snuck up and blown up in 1 shot so I'm not usually sitting full agi until I have a safe enough feeling max hp pool post-linkens. Until then I usually try to match the average hp of my teammates / maybe a touch under if I'm feeling safer.\n\nI'm not making very good use of replicate. Once in a while I'm cloning a hard hitting ally to help us tear down a tower, once in a while I'm using it on an enemy to be a quick gap closer, and once in a while I'm cloning an ally and sending it back as an escape, but I think there's more I can do with it. I've seen in replays some players will farm in two places on the map with a replica, which shouldn't be too hard for me to micro due to some history playing Naga Siren, but I just haven't really executed it yet.\n\nI'm also not really tread switching on him yet. I certainly mean to, and it could be used to really great effect to save me some mana casting waveform (or using morph?) in the early game or activating replicate, but once the eblade and adaptive strike are in play, I want to maximize Agi at which point tread swapping Int to save mana becomes sub-optimal and only tread swapping Str for survival reasons becomes necessary, right? At any rate, the tread switching will come, but I tend to wait until the hero feels like second nature before I open that can of worms.\n\nAlso, my farm on Morphling is kind of bad. Sometimes when I'm not near enough to a teammate to make a replica, I get nervous and hold on to my waveform to escape, but waveform has a lot of waveclear farming potential, so I'm aware that I'm sacrificing GPM for safety. I'm not sure if this is worth it.\n\nMy farm looks pretty bad though, I'm not great at it on this hero. I can certainly get *above* my average lh@10 compared to my other heroes, but my lh@20+ is lesser. This is because some of my other favorite heroes are Ember Spirit, Luna, and Medusa who have abilities/builds that accelerate farm. I'm aware I can buy QB on Morphling, and with better coordination between allies, I could have better replica uptime therefore feeling safer to use waveform to clear creeps. What do you guys think?\n\nAlso, my farming patterns and routes / farm-related decision making needs work, but that's a problem that applies to ALL heroes that I play, not just Morphling, and I'm already working on that, I just want to clarify that I'm kind of thinking specifically about how to utilize morphling's kit and strengths to get more farm on him.\n\nTo make up for it somewhat, my 6.0 KDA on Morphling is higher than my KDA on any other hero that I've played at least this much or more, so I've been able to help my GPM that way, particularly because I like to rotate when enemies are pushing other lanes. In my last game, two heroes were under half health between our bottom T1 and T2 and unfortunately got away from my rotation, opportunity costing me a lot of xp and gold, but thankfully not the match.\n\n12 games is a very small sample size but even still, winning 10 out of those 12 definitely gives me something to consider, and motivates me to grow that sample size and see what it will reward me with, but I know I need to learn to play him more adeptly if I want to continue this trend as my MMR rises from it. That's going to happen naturally of course, because by playing him I'm practicing him.\n\nHonestly, this post is mostly just a generic think-out-loud post / seeking encouragement / morphling tips request. Sorry it's unfocused, I just had misc thoughts about how this has been going for me and nobody to share them with. Thanks for your time guys.\n\n","id":"55ayy8","distinguished":null,"quarantine":false,"author_flair_css_class":"text","is_self":true,"saved":false,"retrieved_on":1480187921,"ups":2,"post_hint":"self","spoiler":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_text":"I am garbage.","secure_media_embed":{},"archived":false,"locked":false,"edited":false,"contest_mode":false,"secure_media":null,"num_comments":4,"thumbnail":"self","domain":"self.learndota2","permalink":"/r/learndota2/comments/55ayy8/im_playing_morphling_wrong_but_its_working/","score":2,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/55ayy8/im_playing_morphling_wrong_but_its_working/","title":"I'm playing Morphling wrong but it's working:","link_flair_text":"Dotabuff"}

Which is how I ended up at her bday.\n\nI've since learned that she's.....well....older, which I figured,  but she looks way younger than she is. I'm 30, she's 48. \n\nI was coming back from lunch and we ran into each other in the middle of campus.  We hailed each other and started chatting,  and I felt like she was gonna hug me *i have issues with touching, and hesitated, but was down for it, lol, wtf?!* but she hesitated and opted for standing too close instead.  \n\nGuys. Idk. Every time I'm around her, I just wanna hold her and take care of her.  I'm suddenly the most confident person on the planet and even though she's got her shit together and I'm waaayyy below her socially,  I just have this.....need and feeling to actually take care of her. Like....In every way. Cuddle her, make her bfast,  bring her coffee in bed, like....everything.  I don't understand it. \n\nHonestly,  she's probably not even into women, but,  dammit!  How do I stop this?! What is it with that \"certain thing\" some ladies have that just. .....make us lesbianriffic? Ugh. Kill me now, thanks!","quarantine":false,"distinguished":null,"id":"55b2j0","hide_score":false,"stickied":false,"downs":0,"gilded":0}

{"selftext":"**TL:DR** - Alcoholic parents refuse to make any effort to be a part of my life or my brother's life. Not sure what to respond to my mom's crappy email with, or if I should just wash my hands of them and move on. \n\nHoly crap, long post, sorry. Condensing is not my forte.\n\n**BACKGROUND INFO** on what my parents are all about and some bullshit situations that occurred: Both of my parents are 59/57 years old. My parents love their cigarettes and booze. They are alcoholics, the non-functioning type at this point. It destroyed their health. My dad had a heart bypass and developed diabetes --- still smokes and makes mixed drinks several times a day. My mom almost died twice due to complications of cirrhosis, and still drinks, and smokes as well. Dad hasn't worked in almost a decade and mom was a SAHM. By the time I was in highschool there was not much food in the house. Alcohol and cigarettes more important. One night after I graduated, mom started throwing up blood. Parents hid it from me. She apparently refused to go to the hospital, and he allowed her to refuse. Next morning I woke up to what looked like a murder scene in the bathroom. My dad was actually on the phone asking the nurse if he should bring her in. Trust me, it was a no fucking shit Sherlock situation. I yelled at him and said, she needs to go to the ER now. He stopped to make himself cigarettes first. She nearly died. Last year she somehow contracted Hep B even though she never leaves the house and no one else has it. She also had really bad anemia somehow and needed several blood transfusions. Being 550 miles away I found out about it really late and the only reason I did was because my sister in law told me she was worried about my mom. I got very suspicious, because my mom quit emailing me so much. She lied (or perhaps did believe) she had the flu. She has a history of being very secretive and lying about her health issues. I called to talk to her, and it was clear that something was VERY wrong. I told her to put my dad on the line, and I threatened him that I was going to call an ambulance. He acted like he was going to be done with me forever if I did that. He was so furious and pissed that I even suggested it. I told him he needs to step up and take some responsibility and take care of her. The next day he finally ended up bringing her, after I believe two weeks of this shit going on, but again, she nearly died. She was in ICU for awhile, again. Like last time, she refused to go to the hospital, and he allowed her to refuse. \n\nThey are neglectful of themselves, each other, and were also of me. for example, when I was little my elbow got broken. I have no idea how it happened, and neither do they, apparently. My mom thinks it was my brother. Mom claims there was too much swelling that they couldn't see in the xray that it was broken. There was a large chunk of bone that was entirely separated. I'm told my arm was like that for a month. I remember not being able to move it for a long time. Somehow my nose was also broken when I was very young. Too young to remember it.  I had sharp cartilage poking through the interior skin of my nose, and if you looked up the one nostril you'd see it. It was painful and constantly kept trying to scab over to protect and heal itself I guess but it couldn't. Whenever the scab would come off it would bleed and you could see and feel something hard as like, bone. My mom had always told me, \"they don't fix children's noses, you have to wait to grow up before they'll do it.\" When I was in middle school, her excuse was that we were constantly in between insurances. My dad always had the same job. It wasn't until I became an adult that I realized she was fabricating lies. We actually had pretty good insurance. In high school I finally convinced them to bring me to a doctor to get it fixed. The cartilage was very zigzagged and there was only so much he could do. \n\nAnyway, when I turned 19 I moved 550 miles away, from OH to CT. A year later I was married. Now I am 27, and my parents have still not visited me once. They never call me either. Whenever I call them, they always say some horse shit about having free long distance calls and insist on hanging up and calling me back. Yet they never call me on their own. They did not visit or call to congratulate me when I got married. I got a congrats email from my mom. They did not send a card or a gift. Out of embarrassment of having estranged-ish parents, I wanted to elope and so that's what we did. Any time I've tried to convince them to visit, they always have an excuse. I offer to buy plane tickets, train tickets, my husband offers to drive 550 miles to pick them up, bring them here, and then bring them home. They always have some excuse. Last one I heard was some bullshit from my Dad about the plane will probably get hijacked by a terrorist. I know he's not afraid to fly, he used to take flying lessons. They often use doctor appointments as excuses, but then don't show up to them. \n\nI have tried maybe buying their love --- by giving them a TV. I pay for their Netflix. We got them a Roku. We have given them laptops, bought them a new stove. And while I'm sure it is appreciated, it hasn't drawn them closer. My brother does not lift much of a finger to help them in the way of anything, so I am told, and my mom often talks shit about him to me. My brother and I are pretty much estranged as well. I found out through his wife, my sister in law, that my mom's health was on the decline and had been falling over a lot.  I tried to convince my parents to move near me, or perhaps even live with us, so that we could be together, so that I could take care of them. Understandably I guess, they don't want to leave their shit hole of a home, even though neither of them have one single friend in the world, and they both don't ever see their families let alone even talk to them, out of spite. Through  trying to convince them to move here, I also found out from my sister in law that my dad supposedly told my brother that in their will he was getting their house and the property they own. It felt like a slap in the face. I feel bad for saying that, because what I care for and wanted is a relationship with them, not an inheritance, but it hurt nonetheless. It seemed weird, considering all of the shit talking my mom has done about them, and claims that my husband and I are both of their preferred ones. I asked my brother about it, and he threw it in my face basically: what do I care for, I moved away. I asked my mom about the inheritance thing, she acted shocked. Then my dad acted like, that's not what he told him, but I don't believe him. Deep down I knew they wouldn't go for moving though, but I had to try anyway. My mom never leaves her house, she is a hermit. I figured what does it matter what state she is in if she never leaves her couch anyway. \n\nMy dad had to force her to come to the hospital to visit her first grand child. It upsets my brother and his wife that they never see their grand child. She will not bring her son to their house because it is filthy, in general and because of nicotine. They were furious when they found out it was because of the nicotine that she didn't want to bring him over. They acted righteously indignant. My mom acted like they were selfish pieces of shit for advocating for their child. I told her, well you know what, it's just not healthy. It is what it is. The last time I visited, after a 10 hour drive, the entire house smelled so bad of cat shit and urine that we drove to the store to buy cleaning supplies and litter supplies and I went down to the basement and cleaned it, and I was absolutely exhausted. it reeked all the way up to the attic. I don't want to and won't bring my baby into that environment either. I think they've seen my brother's kid a total of 2 times and he's over a year old now. They live about 5 minutes away. \n\nThis past July, I had my first baby. The one time my mom actually made an effort to call me was while I was in labor, and she knew I was in labor because I was being induced that day and emailing her updates about starting the inducement and stopped emailing her when labor started. We didn't answer the phone. She did not call again after my husband emailed her and other family members an update about the baby being born and stuff. I may have gotten an email of congratulations. They did not send a card or a gift. I don't feel like I'm entitled to a gift but it strangely felt bad when I received a bunch of presents for the baby from family members I'm not even close to and nothing ever from my parents. Lately she claims she is going to bring stuff with her for the baby and wants to know what I need but I ignored her question, because that's not what I really care about. my mom and I used to email each other a lot. She never emails me on her own accord anymore. She only sends me responses to my emails. She never shares important information or updates or anything about their health, their life, or anything. Well before the baby was born, my mom said she was going to come out here to see him. She acted like she really wanted to be here when he was born, but I didn't want to play hostess after bringing a new born baby home and having my tits out 24/7 trying to master the art of breastfeeding. It was the right move, it was definitely not a time for guests. So we agreed, late august they would come. Late august came and passed. September has now come and gone. I asked in early Sept why they never came, and apparently it was because she never got her tooth situation dealt with. Back in June the cap came off of her front tooth and the dentist said all of her teeth needed to be pulled and she needed dentures. She is acting like it took months for the check to arrive from my dad's account so that she could pay for her tooth situation. For some reason it still hasn't been dealt with and she doesn't want to come here and be a \"toothless wonder.\" She keeps moving the visitation date back, and now claims November.\n\nlast night, I told my mother that my husband did not want any drinking in the house. Last time I was there, which was last year, we treated my best friend and both of my parents and brought them out to dinner. It was a great struggle to convince my mom to leave the house. It was nothing fancy, but it was an expense and my dad took it upon himself to get multiple beers on our dime, He got loud and obnoxious, spilled his second one everywhere and also made some weird inappropriate comments. We were all really embarrassed, and then later that night he kept pounding back liquor and came outside to \"hang out\" with my husband and my best friend while we were sitting around a fire. He kept bringing up the past, something that happened when I was 13, I was falsely accused of some shit, and he was trying to claim it wasn't my fault, but I told him I didn't want to talk about it or think about it anymore, it's been over a decade and I've moved on and want to look forward not behind. It really pissed him off, and he proceeded to curse at me and yell at me and call me names in front of my husband and best friend. It was extremely embarrassing and my husband was floored and prepared to deck him because when I got up to leave my dad wouldn't back off and followed me. My dad called me a bitch and made some comment to my husband about encouraging my husband to physically abuse me and my husband essentially insulted his character for saying such a thing and told him he isn't that kind of man. Later dad apologized and felt really embarrassed. I can brush it off because I am used to it. When I was younger, he even got physically violent towards me once. My sister in law tells me that the first thing my dad said when he showed up to their son's 1st birthday party was \"where's the beer?\" and proceeded to drink my brother's beer, which was not for the party, and it was not that kind of party. It upset her a lot. That's just how he is, he runs on alcohol. My husband has no tolerance for it, and he doesn't want drinking going on in the house when it could bring on behavior like that. I agree with him. So I told my mom this already, a couple months ago, and her response to me was that she told my dad it would be okay if he just had beer, but no liquor. That's what she responded to me with, when I said we didn't want drinking going on. It was really disrespectful, and I didn't bother saying hey, that's not what I said. I just brought it up the other day again though, to put my foot down, and she asked me to ask my husband if beer was okay at least. I told her it was a no, he wasn't comfortable with it. \n\nShe got mad and said **\"Okay.  I'll tell dad that.  I don't even know when we'll make it to be honest with you. So many appts coming up.  I'll be mailing your stuff. I just want to know, is there anyone that meets your guys' standards or that are as perfect as you guys? that's not a slam by any means, trust me. Just asking.\"**\n\nFirst of all -- how is that not a slam. Are we really the assholes here? My husband got so pissed off he said \"Fine. Next time I see her will be at her funeral then and I will be doing them no more favors.\" I can't say I blame him. I'm wondering if I should just give up and move on and stop trying. I think the hardest part about it, is how easy it will be. Because I know they will not email, they will not call, they will not visit. They will easily just let me go like they don't care and that's what hurts the most I think. \n\nMy first instinct was to write back and **insult her**. My second urge was to try to take the **high road.** And then I thought, maybe I should just wash my hands of them and stop reaching out to them. I wish I could write back and say something and really stick it to her but I don't know what I would even say.

I played two sessions of D&amp;D 3.5 Where no one knew what they were doing and then I started playing Pathfinder with a different group of people. I've had about six sessions with this group and I'm fairly used to it and understand most of it now. The thing I am still confused about is armor. \n\nI'm playing a bladebound magus with a one level dip in crossblooded orc/dragon sorc. I get heavy armor proficiency at level 13, and I love the idea of people going around in heavy armor and beating the crap out of people while shooting them with magic. I have no idea how armor works though in terms of upgrades. I know basic fullplate gives 9 AC, but this seems kinda low when I could just use bracers of armor and go Kensai for extra AC.\n\nMy DM allows retraining so I was thinking about adding in the kensai archetype. We're currently only level 3 so it wouldn't be too hard to retrain it. I did the math and with bracers of armor+8, Amulet of natural armor +5 and ring of deflection +5, along with the headband and the belt I would be getting regardless, I would end up with around 45 AC and 28 touch AC. This seems pretty good to me, but it could be considered low by end game which is most likely when I would have all the items. I think Kensai would be cool too because then I wouldn't need exotic weapon proficiency since it's built in and it's also pretty bad ass to just be a dude walking straight up to the enemy with no protection except for his weapon, and still kicking their ass. It would come with some cool and useful feats built in and  I would save money on armor and since bladebound gives me a free weapon all my money would be spent on wondrous items, rings, magical tattoos, spell scars, potions, etc.\n\nProblem with Kensai is I don't like how they don't have spell recall or knowledge pool and one of there arcanas are chosen for them, along with diminished spell castings. \n\nI could link what I have currently planned. I know that if I stick with what I have I'll probably become useful in like 3 more levels. Right now I am missing most of the things I hit since I only have 15 strength right now, but I was planning on adding to that with the belt and level up bonus attributes (except for level 4. That's going to be int to raise my modifier again). Currently I'm 15/14/14/19/14/14.\n\nIt would be great if someone could explain armor and armor upgrades and if they're worth it or just too much of a pain with crafting, expenses, and movement penalties. \n\nTL;DR New player playing an int/strength magus, needs an explanation of armor and armor upgrades and help deciding if I should retrain to add kensai in. Any help would be greatly appreciated.","author_flair_css_class":null,"is_self":true,"saved":false,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1480188042,"author_flair_text":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"archived":false,"locked":false,"spoiler":false,"over_18":false,"thumbnail":"self","domain":"self.Pathfinder_RPG","permalink":"/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/55b680/please_help_me_fix_my_build/","edited":false,"contest_mode":false,"secure_media":null,"num_comments":6,"title":"Please Help Me Fix My Build?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/55b680/please_help_me_fix_my_build/","link_flair_text":null,"score":1}

Is it generally a bad idea to be going in blind and learning in the job without any prior experience of caring for a baby? I've never babysat for anyone as there haven't really been any opportunities for me to do so. There aren't any family members with babies who I can ask.

How hard was it for you to figure out the basics such as feeding, changing nappies and potty training? Also, how much time did it take for you to learn your baby's cries and what they mean?

I've hit a kind of crossroads in my life. I'm 23, freshly graduated from university (music performance, save your eye rolling until the end) and, up until today, was looking for a better job to tide me over until I could do my Master's degree next year.\n\nHowever, I went to an interview day type thing today (shadow someone doing a day in the life), and the job seemed to be one of those too good to be true, commission only ordeals, one of those \"I've been with the company 6 months and i'm already a manager!\" things. However, as the day went on, and I observed, I realized not only that the targets were easily achievable (the guy I was shadowing had done double his daily by lunch), but the spiel they were giving about quick promotions was very achievable, and laid out in a not-unreasonable structure. Long story short, I aced the interviews and got offered the job there on the spot, about four hours ago. It seemed perfect. However...\n\nI love being in a band, gigging and playing music in general. At times its been literally the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning, motivating me to pick up more hours at my current crappy job so I can contribute my fair share towards upkeep. The job would require me to be working 10am-9pm, 6 days a week, with little room for flexibility. Between the long commute and the rough hours, it leaves little time for just casually playing, let alone being in a regularly gigging band. \n\nIt was made pretty evident that the two couldn't peacefully co-exist, either I would have to put music on the back burner while I was working there, or I could jog on. I would love to get the kind of experience they offer, and i'm not adverse to the long days per-se, just the rigid inflexibility of it.\n\nSo, for the first time in my life, I throw myself to the mercy of the internet.\n\nWhat do, reddit?","link_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1475285429,"media":null,"author":"bibblesmeck","name":"t3_55b6c3","subreddit":"Advice","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"archived":false,"over_18":false,"spoiler":false,"permalink":"/r/Advice/comments/55b6c3/career_or_happiness/","thumbnail":"self","domain":"self.Advice","secure_media":null,"num_comments":5,"edited":false,"contest_mode":false,"link_flair_text":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/55b6c3/career_or_happiness/","title":"Career or Happiness?","score":1,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1480188044}

A little bit of background on me, I am 28 years old and have been religion free for about 11 years now but I didn't become a godless heathen until about 6 years ago. I was not born in the organization but I was forced to go to the meetings since the age of 5 and I got baptized at the ripe old age of 12. I have a total of 7 siblings, 5 brothers and 2 sisters, (typical Mexican family lol) but only my sisters, my second oldest brother, and I attended (begrudgingly). My parents are not jw's, they decided to leave both my formal and spiritual education up to my oldest sister because my dad was sick throughout my childhood so my mom had to take care of him. \n\nI always hated going to the meetings and would constantly fidget and daydream to keep myself awake like the majority of the kids I knew. I was a very curious child and would constantly ask questions about nature and how things worked which would later lead to my current career, more on that later. As I got older I began to ask more complicated questions, questions that never had a satisfactory answer. The majority of those questions had to do with, well, dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures hence the title lol. I would ask why the bible never mentioned anything about these ancient creatures and the typical answer I would get was \"only jehobo knows.\" \n\nAs you can probably imagine, my curious nature led me to do more research on the topic using outside sources. This eventually led me to read about the theory of evolution but the indoctrination had a stranglehold on me and I did not want to believe what I had read. All of this happened when I was around 14-15 years old so my older siblings chalked my questions up to the rebellious stage in life so i was never really reprimanded for asking.\n\nAbout 3 years after my little research expedition to my local library had taken place I was scheduled to go into surgery due to a small benign tumor that I had developed in my lower back. I was ecstatic that I had a legitimate excuse to avoid going to the meetings. However, the pain from having a portion of flesh removed from my lower back and upper left butt cheek was not fun lol. This eventually led to me missing about 6 months of meetings so by the time I got better I had zero desire to go back. This of course, didn't sit too well with my sisters who constantly badgered me about going back to the meetings. I didn't care and at that point in my life I had my mom's blessing to decide whether I wanted to stay in the organization or leave it. I chose to leave. My younger sister (she's actually older than I am) eventually left the organization too but my two other siblings are still very much a part of it.\n\nAfter leaving, I spent the next 6 years trying to become a normal well adjusted human being. However, that was easier said than done. I didn't really know what to do so I spent those early years of full fledged freedom from job to job, discovering the wonders of women, alcohol, weed, and cocaine. While working as a manager at  an auto parts store and working alongside someone who had been with the company for 30 years with zero upward movement. That particular experience scared the living shit out of me because I didn't want to end up like that guy, 60 years old and working the same shitty position. I came to the conclusion that I had to go back to school and get my degree. That happened back in 2012 so when the time came I registered at my local community college and began the journey that I am about to finish at the end of this school year. I am attending a renowned research university and getting a B.S. in biochemistry with a minor in electronic engineering and will be applying to medical schools next fall.\n\nI consider myself rather fortunate because even though I am no longer a jw I still have a really good relationship with my oldest sister. We're closer now than we ever were when I was growing up. She tells me that she sees me as a good role model for my niece, who is 20 and also in college, and is proud of the man I have become. Also, higher education was never out of the picture growing up since my entire family, jw or not, always saw the value of it. My oldest sister went to a university in Mexico but had to drop out because my parents couldn't afford it and so she made it her goal once I was born to plant that seed in my brain. We no longer speak about religion as I have made it abundantly clear that there is a greater possibility of hell existing than of me ever returning and she respects that.\n\nDamn, this was longer than I expected it to be lol. Thank you to everyone who has posted their story on this sub. I feel like I can talk to any of you and know that you all can relate to some of my story. Also, I just want to add that if you are young and want to go into higher education you should do it.

I said something like \"do you realize I haven't gotten a blow job in six years?\" She responded with \"well I haven't gotten fucked in seven months, so there.\"\n\nWe were both in the kitchen, the blinds were down, and the sliding glass door was on the other side of the room. I just went for it and kissed her. She reciprocated and it turned into a ten second makeout.

It went from playful to us texting each other that we had imagine fucking the other one for a long time. I said something like \"just be sure the next time you wear a dress or skirt in front of me you're not wearing any underwear so we won't have to waste time.\"  She laughed and was like \"you wouldn't...you know this is just us texting back and forth because we're horny.\"\n\nWell a week later, I stopped over there with the kids at 6pm during the week. Her husband works 7a-7p and has a 30 minute commute. My wife was out shopping with her mom.\n\nI get over there and she was wearing extremely short shorts. Couldn't tell if it was planned or not at that point. The kids head to the yard. \n\nWe looked at each other and I just knew. I grab her again and we start making out.

Was a quckie, less than 5 minutes, but my God it was good.\n\nWe have been having sex since then. 2-3x/week or whenever we can. We have had sex in both of our houses, cars, restaurant bathroom on one occasion, you name it.\n\nI don't regret this at all, neither does she.

{"selftext":"I'm 34 years old, I'm single, and I'm a teacher at an elementary school. I live in a small town, but I love taking road trips to a large american city. On these trips I bring an arsenal of hypnotic sedatives, my desire for beauty, a beer cooler, heroin, and my beloved tattoo kit. \n\nIf you met me on the street, you'd never guess my secret passion for tattoos. I keep a conservative outward appearance- the guys at the gym have no idea. I travel to the city to get my tattoos...I don't do conventions, and I don't know any tattoo artists.\n\nAside from the tattoos, I have another interesting hobby: a not-so-secret interest in knitting. A couple years ago, I co-founded a knitters guild at our church. We organize a fall crafts bazaar and we do charity work in the big city. Each winter, our group delivers boxes of hand knitted scarves, hats and mittens to give to the homeless at a soup kitchen...in the same neighbourhood where I got my first tattoo!\n\nI got my first tattoo when I was 16. I drove Dad's farm truck into the city to get it. The tattoo is an old-school-style heart and anchor. The deed was done in a dark alley. I'll never forget the excitement of that first time...the blood, my erection, my trophy. In retrospect it was a risky move for a 16 year old!\n\nIn recent years my (secret) fascination with tattoos turned into a full blown obsession. I actually just finished my one thousandth tattoo tonight! It's a beautiful forearm sleeve featuring an indian goddess. While I was working on it, I got so excited I ejaculated in my pants!\n\nIf we connected on Facebook, you wouldn't find any photos of tattoos or tattoo status updates. In real life, I carefully manufactured a distinct \"school teacher\" image...complete with (knitted) sweater vests. I wear kaki pants to work, and I keep my beard neatly trimmed. I eat the same sensible breakfast each day and (I think) I'm balding gracefully. I drive a modest (beige) sedan and I hope to eventually become the vice principal at my school.\n\nLet me tell you about my tattoo kit. The look of that shiny black leather stirs primal excitement in me. On the outside, it appears to be a regular brief case. Inside, it contains the sacred items that bring meaning to my life. It's amazing how much can fit inside a regular briefcase! Whenever I touch the handle with my fingers, I feel a tingle run through my insides. My heart starts beating faster, and I wonder where/how I'll get my next tattoo.\n\nAs I said, I'm celebrating tattoo number one thousand tonight. In the bathroom, a junkie is passed out (heroin) and there's a bloody mess with him. I met the junkie earlier, in a seedy bar near the wharf. We were flirting and I fell in love with the tattoo. He used my cash to book this motel room....and he waited for me to arrive later with his (free) heroin. With cum drying in my underwear, and his blood all over the bathtub, I prepared my new tattoo for the trip home. \n\nEarlier, I emptied the contents of the motel ice machine into my beer cooler. The remains of his forearm are stored on ice, in a black garbage bag. A sick burning odor lingers in the air- I used a small butane torch to cook the dope.....and cauterize the stump. My fresh new tattoo is on ice too- I placed it in a clear plastic bag so I can sneak peaks at it on the drive home.\n\nInside my tattoo kit I carry a variety of surgical tools and razor sharp scalpels. I carry first aid materials, a bone saw, chemical heating pads, syringes, rubber tubing, heroin, a spoon, and my trusty butane torch. I do my best to save my donor after I finish a tattoo...I'd like to think some of them survive.

I'm excited to find this board. \n\nI was diagnosed with PCOS in 2009 and had pretty good success with Metformin and low-carb, but fell off the wagon during a bad relationship and gained it all back and added another 40 lbs to my highest weight after having a baby and some generic life stress. Right now I'm 5'2\" and 277 lbs, which is just unbelievable to me, but I gotta start somewhere.  \n\nI ended up getting accepted into a functional medicine program (which, if your clinic has one is pretty amazing), and through blood tests and exams my doctor has diagnosed me with Hashimoto's and off the charts insulin and leptin resistance. (So blessed!) \n\nThe nutritionist who also consults during fun med asked me a bunch of questions about my eating habits and my success with various eating plans like Paleo and keto, and by the end of it she asked me if I'd ever considered that I might have an eating disorder. I ended up leaving there with a diagnosis of EDNOS/BED on top of the other stud and now I have a prescription for Vyvanse along with Armour thyroid and a newly upped 2,000 mg of Metformin ER. \n\nSo far, it's been smooth sailing for the past 48 hours, and it's kind of incredible to feel focused and not completely obsessed with food and when I get to eat next. I don't know if Vyvanse is actually a miracle drug or not, but I'm hoping it coupled with the Metformin will give me support to lose weight in a sane way instead of overdoing it on keto or getting too worried about the purity of my food on Paleo. \n\nI've been doing a lot of reading about female obesity and how ADHD can often lead to compulsive overeating because the constant overstimulation and inability to control focus or attention means you need something to dull out that anxiety from feeling so scattered all the time, and food is the most convenient and socially acceptable way to self-medicate. Ever since I was little, I've had no off switch in my stomach. I've watched other people and how much they eat as a gauge for what's appropriate (like, most people at a social gathering eat two pieces of pizza or a slice of cake should be about 3x3\"), but when I was a kid I'd just eat until I puked because I never felt full and if left to my own devices now I can easily eat a pizza or a pint of ice cream by myself and still go looking for more. I'm hoping that by treating the root of my overeating through medication and counseling, I'll be able to get my PCOS and IR under control enough to repair the metabolic damage it's caused so far. \n\nOther than some pretty intense motion sickness while driving around today, I'm excited about this combination of meds and therapy. So far there's been no apocalyptic stomach issues with the Metformin, so that's awesome. \n\nI'm looking forward to hearing all your stories and connecting with women in similar situations.

Best guess for date would be 1981-82.\n\nThe main feature I remember clearly was that one of the main characters was a talking bee. I seem to recall that the bee was a writer of some sort. He might have worked at a newspaper. Everyone else in the show was human. I don't recall if the bee was cell-animated or stop motion, but I lean towards stop motion. He may have worked with a black woman in her 30s at the paper. \n\nAt the end of every episode, the bee would offer viewers a creative writing prompt in the form of a brief vignette, which was completely stop motion animated (and fairly poorly). It would be something like \"Jane was in her bed, when a creepy ghost appeared... [Jane is animated hiding from ghost]... we need your help to finish the story!

Maybe a future story in the works there, we'll see.\n\nSo I was drunk, and horny, and not quite ready for bed.  So I texted   Laurel - \"sufficiently late and random?\"\n\nShe wrote back immediately - \"yes.\"  Then - \"come over.\"\n\nI didn't know where she lived, asked for clarification, and...  silence.\n\nSo I passed out.  Woke up around 7a and there was a message from her at 6:47a - \"I fell asleep.  Oops.\"  I rolled over and wrote back.\n\nThe messages flew fast and furious.  We were both horny and hungover and horny.  In that order.  She had a roommate.  I had a car.  At 8a I pulled up in front of her place and she got in my car - wearing a t-shirt, no bra, jean shorts and a big smile.\n\nAt 8:10a we pulled up to mine and dashed inside.  I led her to the bedroom and quickly dispensed with our shirts..   I kissed down her neck, her chest.  Took her nipples in my mouth.  Nibbled.  Grabbed.  She was writhing, unbuttoning her jean shorts.  Grabbing at my cock.  \n\nI stood up and pulled her shorts off.  Her panties.  Turned and grabbed a condom and dropped my jeans.  I started to kiss my way up her leg and she said - \"just fuck me already.\"  This was not a place for foreplay.\n\nI obliged.  I rolled the condom on and spread her legs, pressing myself in, slowly at first.  Then faster.  She was tight.  Wet.  Moaning.  We built up a rhythm.  I put her legs over my shoulders, cupped her tits in my hands..  \n\nWe were both close. I told her I was going to cum.  She moaned, tightened her pussy on my cock.  I put my thumb in her mouth and we both came..   hard.\n\nI rolled off of her.  Feeling slightly less hung over.  Smiling.  She tucked into me and we drifted, spooning.

It's been a couple weeks now since it happened. I thought I was doing so well at this job. I was learning how to be a paralegal, it's a good job, good pay, I'll finally be able to get my own place and learn how to be independent. I was right at the end of my provisional period, and they pulled me in and said they were letting me go. No warning, no write ups. Why? Because my work had typos. I've been learning how to draft documents, my trainer has admitted that she's terrible at training, they kept throwing new things at me and making me do other stuff. And they thought my work in general was fine, other tasks they gave me were good, everyone likes my attitude. But \"the level of detail just isn't there\". I'm probably the only person who can say right now that I got fired for typos. How fucking stupid can you be, honestly. \n\nThis place caused me anxiety. I try not to make major judgement calls on people, but this was an office of 100% women and I hated it. It was all about cattiness, and gossip, and Real Housewives, and where you got your nails done. Every time I did the tiniest thing wrong, the entire office had to gossip about it. This is not one of those things where, it's just your anxiety telling you they're talking about you. I could hear them, talking about me like I was stupid. I was far from the only person who made mistakes. They all did. And my mistakes were minor in comparison to the crap they pulled. But I was new, so therefore I have to be perfect, apparently. \n\nI don't know what I'm going to do now. Nothing gets my anxiety in a tailspin quite like a job search. It can make me feel physically unwell. And I'm trying, believe me. I search the websites, I updated my resume, I send it out. And some days I have good days. Or a few good hours when I feel optimistic. But it doesn't last. My mood honestly is so variable right now. \n\nI can't help but feel like a failure. I have friends I went to college with, they all have good jobs, careers even, most of them are married. I'm 27 fucking years old, my birthday is next week, and I'm sleeping in the same twin bed in the same room I've had my whole pathetic life. I don't know what I want to be, or how to do it. I am paralyzed by my fear, so often. I'm so afraid of letting people down, of not living up to their expectations. What am I supposed to do with my life? I just want to be happy, is that asking too much?\n\nSorry for my rant, I guess I'm just looking for a little outside perspective, please. And a hug.

Redditors? Anyway, I'm not sure if this is the right sub where I can post this but I need to clear my mind and to put this somewhere. I'm 16 years old and in my last year of highschool. My literature teacher is planning to do a school magazine that will include news, interviews, fiction, etc, and he has named me as \"chief\" of the literature section. Me and some of my classmates (that I chose) have to write short stories, poems and book reviews. My problem is that I feel my stories aren't good nor original. I finished one and I like the concept but not the way I wrote some parts. Since the magazine must have some poems I tried to make one. I went to sleep happy after finishing it, but I woke up with regret and thinking: \"It sucks.\" In showed it to my teacher anyway and he said it was \"Fine\", which I interpreted as \"Awful, but it's the only thing we have.\" Now I'm feeling insecure, wether if it's a good decition to publish my work in the magazine. Everyone in school will see it, maybe some parents. I don't want to be the bad writer wanna-be who will never be. \n\nThere's also envy. My friend writes in english (we speak spanish) and she mostly writes fanfiction. She gave me a short story so I could translate it. I did, and I realised she writes better than me. I know it's stupid to feel envious because of this, I know it's bad but it hurt when people praised her work over mine. She's my bestfriend, after all. I feel good for her.\n\nThe magazine will be published in the first week of October. I've just made one \"regular\" story and one bad poem. I plan making a book review about A Clockwork Orange, but I haven't even started yet. Plus, I'm in exams and I have to study for some, and I go to an academy to practice for my university entrance exam (Sorry for that awful translation, but I can't find the precise words) and I don't have a lot of time because of this. \n\nWhat do you think? Am I overreacting? Am I just unbelievably stupid? I need some advice.\n\n(Sorry if there's any bad english or spelling mistake. Sorry if you see a lot of posts like this and you are fed up by now. Sorry for saying sorry so many times. Sorry.)","hide_score":false,"stickied":false,"gilded":0,"downs":0}

I was beginning to feel horny again and started touching myself more that week. Finally, I decided I needed to go out on a date and let things get steamy with the right person/chemistry.\n\nI went on a tinder date, the guy was a creep, so I dissed him and went to a very nice bar downtown to have a beer before going home to bed. \n\nI ordered a beer started drinking, relaxing my body and trying to move on from that horrible and stupid date. \n\nThen, an older man in his 50's stood by me to place an order.

Last month, for some reason, I was concerned with my heart. It would usually be a cramp near my right chest. I would mentally focus on it, causing my heart rate to raise. For a few days I handled it. The 4th day, it was a normal day, working from home, suddenly I paid too much attention to my heart and suddenly it spiraled out of control, my heart rate was around 150 so I called 911 and told them I was having a heart attack.\n\nThey ran EKG, blood tests, urine, all that fun stuff. Doctor released me with some beta blocker and said I had a panic attack. I've never had one before, but while the EMT rushed me to the hospital my HR went above 200 so they injected me with valium. My whole body was numb, I thought for sure I was going to die. \n\nThat was a month ago. My step dad is a doctor so he perscriped me with a little Xanax and daily Klonopin. It's been almost a month now. Nearly every day, out of no where, I start focusing on my heart. Not necessarily chest pain, just focus/energy in that area. I think I'm about to die any second from a heart attack. I take some Xanax and I'm fine, but yet I'm still convinced I'm going to die any day now from a heart attack. It's destroying me, my wife, my son, my family. Is this anxiety or is this heart problems? I am too scared to get a full chest X-Ray because I believe it will show that I have severe heart problems. \n\nEver since that day I called 911, I keep thinking I'm about to have a heart attack, any second, and I'll die. The thought of dying any second multiple times a day is fucking ruining me. I am wondering if someone else has these experiences. I've never had anxiety before like this. I am 23 years old, male.
