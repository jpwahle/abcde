And he doesn't mean that sarchasticlly or light-heartedly; I have to clean his truck all the time, do their dishes, clean the house, &amp;, above everything, watch my sisters almost everyday for at least 2 or 3 hours on weekdays, usually the entire day on at least one half of the weekend. If I'm just in a bad mood or anything, my mom's husband makes me go sit outside, where it is freezing, and just sit there for hours.

They shouldn't even be considered family. I hate all of them. Starting with my dad, which I'm pretty sure caused most of my family to be fucked up, including me. I'm not sure what to call it. I don't think it's called abuse, but it might be. The police have been to my house quite a few times in the past 2 years. This isn't because my dad started acting terrible lately, but because I called them because I didn't know what else to do anymore. \n\t\n\tI can't remember every single time the police came because my memory is terrible, but I know that the last time was because he choked my mom and threw her on the bed, and I'm pretty sure the other times it had to do with my mom, too. I'm not strong enough to do anything so I figured after what I'm told has been years of him being a terrible person and getting away with it, I called them. It didn't do anything. Every time. Nothing happened to him. I think it's because he's a cop too. Well, they finally got a divorce a few months ago and he's gone now. My little sister goes to see him sometimes but not often. One day he tried to break into the house because I wouldn't let him inside since he doesn't live here anymore. He came through the window and let himself in. I pushed him out. This was during the time the divorce was still being worked out, and yet all he got was a warning from my mom's lawyer. He gets away with anything. \n\t\n\tIn the past he's done other shit. Hit my head against the wall because I woke him up with my coughing. That was a big one. No one cared. Not even my mom. Another thing I remember is my family telling me a lot of stories of him abusing my older sister emotionally and sometimes physically. I can't remember all the stories. I can't tell you guys everything about my dad anyway because it's just too much and I don't want my whole post being about him.\n\t\n\tNow that he is gone, my house is a lot less stressful. Me, my mom, little sister, and older sister visits for a few months every now and then since she lives out of state. My mom has a nice boyfriend. Now about the rest of my family. My little sister is the shortest because I don't know anything about her and I don't think anyone else does either. Sometimes I feel sorry for her, but she is a brat. But no one parents her. My mom and older sister scream at her and throw around empty threats, but that's it. She's up all night on social networks and sleeps all day after school. She is 11. I feel like my sister and moms scream at her and use her as a punching bag. I could be totally wrong.\n\t\n\tMy older sister is next. I'm convinced she is totally unstable. She acts like my mother and my little sister's mother and I hate it. Because she constantly fights with my mom for no good reason and makes the house more stressful to live in. She will cry and bitch and scream at everyone. Except me. Because now I don't get involved in their fights, because they are impossible to diffuse. She went through a lot as a kid, and I understand that. An unloving father, that hated her. I know what you're thinking. He didn't hate her. Yes he did. This isn't a good example at all, but they were texting one day when my mom and sister were out drinking. One thing lead to another and he said to her that she wasn't his daughter, and he wants nothing to do with her. This lead to a  fight which led to my dad choking my mom and the police coming. Sounds really stupid now that I'm typing it. Anyway, she is very mean to everyone. She starts the fights now that my dad is gone. Also, she lives really REALLY far away and I assume it is very emotionally draining for her. \n\t\n\tNow for my mom. I learned a while ago that she was actually addicted to cocaine for a while. My dad wrote it down on a sticky note and pinned it to his mirror before he left. He did this because my mom was writing inspirational things on sticky notes on her mirror, to see every morning. He responded by writing a LOT of garbage about her on his mirror that my little sister luckily didn't see. He's a fucking child. No, they did not share a room at this time. Anyway..yeah she has had some of her own issues. I will get to the major point that has been bothering me lately though. I have tried talking to her about my depression and stress and insanity twice in the past couple of months. The first time, she got angry with me for the drugs I've done. I didn't like this, and stopped talking to her. I was asking her to see a therapist, and I told her why because I thought she would help me. Wrong. The second time was a week ago. I told her how stressed I've been and apparently I didn't make a convincing argument for this, and she just told me that the REAL world is stressful. Basically, I'm a kid and my problems aren't problems until I'm out of college. Truly amazing. I always looked up on her. I used to be so sad that she was depressed. Now I tried talking to her and she gets angry and blows it off. \n\t\n\tThis leads to me believing that no one really cares about me. People say that people should try to talk to their family and friends about their problems because they'll be happy you tried talking to them. Dead fucking wrong. No one gives two flying fucks because there is other shit to stress about. I get that. Money is EXTREMELY tight and I'm going to a private school that costs a ton of money that my dad only pays half of for. I get that. She works all the time. I UNDERSTAND. But would it kill her to try and help me? \n\t\n\tThere is more to me being upset then just family. This is already so fucking long I'm sorry. School is terrible. Like for a lot of kids. I'm 16. 17 in two weeks. I hope this doesn't change anyone's opinion about me, because I'm really struggling with life. I had no friends except for people I play with on steam until sophomore year. I met my best friend then, and he and I introduced each other into pot. We both grew into it together. It was great. Then over the summer I started getting really bad  shakes from it. Kinda just live with it now. Can't find anything bad about it but then again I can't find anything on it at all. Weed kinda made life easier. It's like a mini vacation every night. I've only tried five drugs, and really the only ones worth mentioning are weed and shrooms because the others were only used once and it wasn't a big deal. I had magic mushrooms November, and I think it completely changed me. Whether that be for worse or better. I had a pretty bad trip, and ended up with serious depersonalization issues for a good month or two and now I'm good. It did so much more but I can't explain. I just think differently of people in a good way I think. Still smoking. Was going to get more shrooms tonight, but I can't get a ride anywhere since my only friends live at least a half hour away with a car. Sucks. I'm sorry I got so off track. School sucks because I hate the type of people I meet and everyone treats my shitty pathetic life as a joke. No one leaves me alone. It's not even bullying. They're just fucking stupid except for book smarts. I'm pretty stupid and I accept that but holy shit no one can take a hint that I don't find your jokes at me funny and I don't make jokes at you so fuck off. And no, I don't like any of you. Can I stop pretending to be your friend now?  It's an all guy school by the way. I mean it's better than public school in middle school..but I can't connect with anyone. The two kids that I did left. We still hang out every weekend though. That's cool. My grades are shit. I'm worried I won't make anything of myself and everyone will be disappointed at me because my family has so many fuck ups in it. I'm going to make nothing out of myself, and I'm dreading the day I finish high school and have no direction in my life. I don't know what I want to do yet. SATs are close and I haven't even started studying yet. I think I want to be a computer programmer because I love video games. Sometimes I think being a therapist or something would be nice though..simple. And I love talking to people about their problems because I like helping people that might be like me or worse. \n\t\n\tMy aunt died two weeks ago. She was on my dad's side and youngest of the siblings. She OD'd on heroine. I haven't seen my dad's side of the family in three years because they hate us apparently. That's what my mom said. They don't. I learned that at the funeral. Anyway. I haven't seen her in three years. She was fucking wonderful. She left behind her son who's 15. Terrible. i remember her being so nice as a kid..but I KNEW something was always off about her. I saw her for a total of 30 seconds at the funeral when the coffin was open. And that was it. I barely cried. I never cry anymore. It feels ridiculous and I embarrass myself. Of course I didn't feel this way at the funeral. \nBut I feel like I should have so much more emotion then this when a family member dies..too bad I don't see them anymore. I hated seeing my dad there. He talked to my family so easily. I refused to talk to him. I'm sorry I know a lot of people will say it's different because his sister died, but he is a terrible person and I don't want to talk to him. \n\t\n\tTL;DR: This has gotten ridiculously long so I'm going to try to make one paragraph about it all  because my thoughts are all over the place. I'm sorry, it's really hard to think and talk. Family doesn't care about me, and I think they need help because we are really dysfunctional. I'm doing terrible in school and I'm worried I won't get into any decent college now and I'll struggle the rest of my life with money. My girlfriend is really wonderful. Dating almost two years. She's depressed as hell too and her parents are so fucking mean to her its awful and they won't help her just like mine won't. I'm so moody all the time now. I think I've been depressed for a long time but I feel like someone would've asked me if i needed help by now..drugs make me over think everything and I feel like i'm losing my mind. I can't fucking think straight anymore. I don't even know why I'm typing all of this! Because I KNOW this is not what I wanted to talk about but I can't fucking explain what's been going on in my head. I feel insane. I don't fit in anywhere, life is frustrating, I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I'm so anxious and nervous all the time I can't socialize with new people because I can't speak my thoughts. It's like I'm losing social skills. I'm always alone now. Dealing with my own thoughts. I wish I had friends that lived close by. I had so many friends on steam but I'm so much different..I hate that the only thing I have in common with them is a game I play. We share nothing else. I feel like there might be something wrong with me, and I want to see someone for help but obviously as demonstrated above I cannot fucking speak my mind at all. Suicide just seems like such a logical option in times like these. If life is pointless, why am I stressing out and being sad over all of this pointlessness? I can't remember a time when I had a lot of friends and went out often honestly\u2026middle school I remember spending my entire summer on my computer. I'm terrible at socializing now. Who would want to be friends with me? I'm a fucking mess. So if anyone read any of this, are any of these problems real? Honestly. I'm pretty sure i'm just a lazy fuck. I don't know what depression really is, so how do I know if I'm depressed. I've lost interest in everything. Life is so boring without weed. I hate forcing myself to take a few days sober. I don't smoke everyday, but sometimes I go on for a few weeks. One final thing, I'm very convinced no one cares about me. I know people will say that's bullshit, but no one checks up on me. I've told so many people that I've been struggling. It's a one day conversation and then it's like it never fucking happened. I swear people are only out to help themselves, and my problems just drag them fucking down more. But it's perfectly fine for you to talk to me, because I'll actually fucking try to help out. Not just have a talk where I pretend to give a shit long enough for you to stop talking to me. I'm really sorry that this is a mess and I obviously can't think straight, so I'm just going to post this and see how it goes. I wish I could say everything, but it's too much and overwhelms me. I just forget about it eventually and bury it deeper. Again, I'm sorry if this seems like a ridiculous reason for being sad. Just had to do something. I have nothing going for me anymore..I'm so fucked when it comes to the real world I guess. I'm really worn out.

I would like to make a comment on the usual stories that come up when people attempt to describe their Premature Ejaculation that they associate with their excessive and increasingly disturbing porn use, as well as share a bit of my story. \n\nThe story that I usually hear on blogs and even on this site, is that guys want to get rid of the PE that they learned from watching porn and jerking off too quickly (i.e. they didn't want to get caught, or other various reasons to doing the deed quickly).\n\nI wonder if that was really the exact case. For me I experienced ED before I experienced PE.  I started watching porn in what I would call a very usual way at around 15 or so.  And as the story goes with porn addicts I began jumping up the porn latter to increasingly arousing things.  It began with the simple search for boobs on the google images, then videos, then sex, then varying sex, then scenarios, tehn groups, then fetishes which zoom in on one aspect or act of sex.  \n\nAt first I had no problems, masturbation was fine, and I found it extremely exciting and fulfilling to masturbate.  For me my perversion growth was exponential so where I didn't really explore much at first, by the time I was 18 and had a girlfriend my senior year of Highschool, I was into bukakke, and pissing, and face-fucking, and other very extreme acts of sex.  \n\nAt first the sex with my then GF was great, and satisfying for the both of us (she verified too at the time).  Although I had a girlfriend, I was also non-stop masturbating--easily 4 times a day if I didnt see her, and of course with the most perverse things I could find.  Then at some point I could not cum sometimes when we were having sex, to which I  would come up with excuses such as I needed to stop because my leg hurt from the football game I played or other bullshit.  But this is all explainable for those who are familiar with the repercussions of porn addiction.  It escalated one step further when I could no longer even keep a boner. And the same thing began to happen with jerking off too...I simply was having trouble getting it up, AND THIS IS WHERE THE CONNECTION OF ED AND PE COMES IN FOR ME.  While I was having a greatly difficult time getting fully aroused and erect I was completely compelled to keep masturbating and get the rush of happy feelings from cumming.  Regardless of the fact that my dick was not entirely hard (the way it used to get) I would hack away at it desperately trying to cum. I would do this in the morning before school, and several times after, all the while forcing myself to ejaculate.  I wasn't even horny, the best word I would come up with is merely compelled by some urge to keep forcing myself to cum. Again that urge makes sense in the context of porn and general sex addiction.  \n\nBut with this now completely forcing of orgasms (with attention brought to not even being really horny nor being erect in the way I used to be) I began to teach myself to cum with very little stimulus, and the PE began to set in. \nI view this as being different then the traditionally told story of simply trying to cum \"quickly\".  I recall in my normal days having a joking conversation about jerking off with friends, and we all confirmed (laughingly) that if we really wanted to, we could easily cum in 30 secs. But that never effected anything at the time. \n\nWith the onset of ED came the need for me to focus and force the muscles and mental mechanisms to get myself to cum (not necessarily quickly, but mechanistically). And it became just that, a mechanism.  I'm 22 now, that GF is long gone for other reasons than sex, and I just graduated from college. My attempt to get aroused has drawn me into further disgusting porn, reaching the sad cold floor of rock bottom with beastiality and Incest (two forms of porn that has entirely taken the humanity out of sexual experiences).  Now had I known of the existence of porn addiction I would have obviously stopped, but I didn't  know so I continued for all four years of college, having onsets of depression and other negative views of life.  \n\nFOR THOSE BRAVE SOULS WHO HAVE GIVEN ME YOUR ATTENTION THIS FAR I APPLAUD YOU AND I SHALL CONCLUDE. \n\nAs I now see my acts retrospectively paired with this new understanding of porn addiction I stand by this notion of mechanistic cumming, this act of masturbation and idea towards orgasm that has taken away all sorts of sensuality from the act of orgasm, turning it into a short spurt and muscle memory twitch of a climax.  For those of you with acquired PE I ask you to look at your new behaviors and your new feelings and sensations that came with your onset of PE.  Before all this nonsense came about orgasms were absolutely phenomenal (my fucking knees would literally shake) but now I cum with a mechanical twitch with no sort of real gratitude toward the act (and that is including with women).  If feels different and lame.  I'm curious of you guys out there who have this same problem if your orgasms have not only become short but unsubstantial compared to the satisfaction you once got from the act.\nHas it become mechanistic? (does that word make sense for how you feel sexual arousal has become for you?) \nI have started my journey of trying to get back to the Old Me. I just wanted to therapeutically reveal my situation, as well as try to draw attention to how I feel my onset of PE actually arouse from my original ED.  How to turn it around? I'm not sure, but anyone with this problem please feel free to get back to me one your feelings.

I guess I'm glad I bring entertainment to people, though.\n[Have you become more humble in the last year or two?](http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/1wnym5/i_am_darqwolff_of_usubredditdrama_infamy/cf3s8nm?context=5)|Certainly. One thing I've figured out is that there's a difference between humility and modesty, and my whole \"I hate false humility\" thing was quite wrong because I was conflating the two. I think I'm amazing, and openly admit it, so I'm not exactly modest - but I try my best to recognize my flaws, and for the ones I'm aware of, I'm just as open about them as I am about my positive qualities.\n |I still have a long way to go though. It's not hard to find more recent examples of me getting into much, much smaller versions of the same sorts of arguments I used to have. I'm insecure and just can't seem to wrap my head around the idea of \"show, don't tell.\" When people tell me things about themselves with no backup, I believe them unless there's a concrete logical proof that they're lying - I'm a very honest and trusting person, so that's where I center my worldview. It's hard for me to see things from the perspective that most people won't believe you have a positive trait unless they've already figured it out by example before you claimed it to be true.\n |And obviously I still have some narcissistic tendencies to work out. It's a slow process trying to figure out which traits are healthy self-respect or confidence, and which ones are unhealthy arrogance. For example, you can see above that I correlate my flaw of assuming people will take me at face value, with the positive traits of honesty and trusting-ness. I think this is good, because it's healthy to remember that every bad thing has a flip side, but it's one of many things that I always have the consider the possibility it may just be me being a narcissist.\n |Anyway, yes. I've worked on my humility a lot, and I think it's fair to say I've made significant progress.\n[*I'm insecure and just can't seem to wrap my head around the idea of \"show, don't tell.\"*  That actually brings me to another question: you had(have\\) quite a lot of pride in your intelligence. Have you utilized that intelligence in any way? Are you inventing? Writing? Programming? Art? Have you created anything tangible that we can look at?](http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/1wnym5/i_am_darqwolff_of_usubredditdrama_infamy/cf3t0hi?context=5)|Inventing - I want to build a car when I'm older. I have a lot of crazy ideas and I work sometimes on this design. I keep coming up with new types of engines, hoping that after years and years of throwing random things at the wall I'll eventually come up with something significantly more efficient than traditional automotive engines today. If that ever happens, I'll definitely try to build this thing. If not, I'll probably just build one for myself and not try to make it a thing.  Writing - I'm working on a television-length animated series to put on YouTube, called the Legend of FIK. The premise is a variety of fictional characters from different genres meeting in post-apocalyptia and embarking on an adventure to stop World War IV and find their ways home. There's a ninja, a Viking, a spaceship captain, a wizard, a cyborg superhero, a private detective from the 1950s, a time-traveling secret agent from the future, a Jamaican ex-drug dealer, and six seasons and a movie worth of storyline with an underlying theme of exploring the relationship between fiction and reality itself, with a plot that I'm hoping sets the world record for the best combination of complexity and understandability. You're free to read [the beginning of the pre-visual rough draft of the pilot episode](http://pastebin.com/5YuiwCTR), but this was written for internal use by me and the script artist who will help me turn the screenplay into storyboard-art/a comic book for use in production, so it's still not a very good demonstration of my skills - the dialog is written to be edited during visualization and improvised on by the actors, the non-dialog is written to be expanded on during visualization, this version of the script is basically nothing but framework. If you'd like, I can tell you when we upload the teaser trailer on YouTube so you can see some actual finished product of my work. Until then, I don't really have much.  Alrin ends up in the Interim, where the Multiverse Stability Agency guards the Reality Vortex Engine. He still has the rooted reality vortex manipulator he stole from Francis Klein, but he's cautious to use it against the End because he thinks the End must have some trick up his sleeve or else he never would have proposed this whole thing. He tells the Multiverse Stability Agency what's going on, but they're under different leadership this time around since their leader died in the last timeline and the weird nature of time in the Interim made that carry over even though most things didn't. The new leader thinks the only safe option is to lock the End's pocket universe up so that there's no way for him to get out of it, so even though he'll destroy everything there, he won't be able to do more than that.  Alrin can't deal with the guilt of letting the one universe die to save the rest a second time, so he uses the power of his vortex manipulator to override the lock and go into the pocket universe anyway. Still cautious about overusing it and accidentally playing into another of the End's master plans, he spends decades using magic to try to turn the tides against the End. Little does he know, he's already played into the plan; by bringing the rooted vortex manipulator into a locked-away pocket universe, the rooted vortex manipulator that was the End's idea and the pocket universe that the End created, he has made the Reality Vortex itself biased towards the End; there's just so much information centered around the End, so close together, that everything he does plays more and more into everything that goes on in the rest of the Multiverse. And Alrin has no idea about this. Outside of the pocket universe, things are becoming more and more hectic, themes like dominion and destruction are becoming prevalent throughout all of time and space, and when the end of all of existence is drawing near, Alrin finds out. He puts a stop to it with the absolute power of the vortex manipulator, because he has no choice, but he thinks about it and decides that the problem with this absolute power is that it doesn't come with absolute knowledge, and absolute knowledge is impossible to attain even with that absolute power. He thinks that absolute power should only be given to someone who has no knowledge that they even have it, to balance things out. He gives the pocket watch to some random amnesiac who forgets all of their memories from a given day as soon as they go to sleep.\n |Programming - I'm learning to program so that I can build an IRC bot that I'm slowly going to build into an artificially-intelligent personal assistant. I think the simplest aspects of human intelligence, the aspects that a computer might actually be capable of mimicking quite easily, are language and what I call analogic reasoning. The latter is just what it sounds like, logic and reasoning based on analogies - I think a huge part of human understanding of concepts is based on likening them to other concepts, and I think all of this primarily stems from the most basic concepts within language, that is, nouns, adjectives, verbs, and phrases. I'm going to have the IRC bot be programmed to learn meanings of words and phrases, and find its own synonyms, and then from there I'm going to teach it to work as a natural language engine and comprehend actual concepts. It will probably take a very long time, but hopefully I'll still be able to do it quickly enough to make some amount of actual contribution to the field of AI.  One wizard was born with the title, the End. He was also abandoned at birth, for reasons unknown, and never given an actual name. Growing up, he was an outcast, his only friend was Alrin, the Existentialist, and he was bullied a lot. He grew to resent the world around him, and in his conversations with Alrin about philosophy and existence, he increasingly felt that the truth of the matter is that everything is completely pointless in the grand scheme of things. This combined with his resentment, and his lack of guidance on how to interpret his title, and he decided it was his destiny to bring the End of all of reality.  He tried to travel back in time to stop the End from ever even creating that pocket universe, but something went wrong and he ended up in the core of the sun - the headquarters of the Multiverse Stability Agency. They told him he couldn't use time travel without a license, and he was at risk of creating a paradox. He learned that the reason the End was in a pocket universe, was because the MSA had implemented a self-defense mechanism in the prime universe, where any events that could lead to the end of the world just create their own divergent timeline and the real world continues as if nothing happened. They wanted to go into this pocket universe and stop the End, but they couldn't interfere with his existence because he was a relic of a bygone realm they had no authority over. With Alrin's permission, they were now able to go in and capture him.  This seemed like game over for the End, since the Multiverse Stability Agency made of distant-future humans had the power of gods, and had no problem restraining him with their advanced technology. However, in the pocket universe, humans never took over the universe, and much more dangerous forms of life ended up doing it instead - it created a stew of hellish destruction and war, which eventually broke out at the original point of divergence and started attacking the real world. The Multiverse Stability Agency was powerless to stop it, due to rules regarding the way their technology handles paradoxes - the point of divergence was in the past, so they can't do anything about it from where they're standing.  Along the way, old-Alrin teaches young-Alrin a decent portion of the magic he knows, but he ends up being killed, as does the leader of the Masters of Reality. Young-Alrin becomes the new leader, and he ends up being faced with a choice: he can either lock Erius away from the Interim and keep it completely inaccessible, allowing the End to destroy every other realm, while Erius survives - or he can steal the Master of Reality's pocket watch reality vortex manipulator and reset the timeline back to the fall of Erius, causing virtually everything that's happened since then to be un-done, but meaning we go back to where the fall of Erius is what really happened to Erius, not just a pocket universe. Alrin will still remember this version of events, and the Multiverse Stability Agency will still occupy the Interim because the Interim is eternal and has no passage of time in the normal sense - other than that, it will all be reset. Alrin is forced to go this route.\n[** Art - I cannot draw.*  Not with that attitude.  Seriously, though, learn some drafting and take a figure-drawing class.

It's very hard to say, but it's possible that the main thing my past self would notice about me is that I'm not as accomplished as I should be, since I always think I'm right on the verge of some particular accomplishment. And my advice for him would be: stop being so lazy, working on your work ethic leads to exponential progress and you know how much we love exponential progress, bro. And, stop forgetting yourself - you make it so there's two totally different versions of you, because you totally forget about major, major aspects of your personality in certain situations. When you're in a bad mood, you need to remind yourself of why you shouldn't be, because you're spending a lot of time making things worse for yourself by completely forgetting to weigh the good against the bad. As an aside to that, girls DO care about you and want to help with your loneliness, but they won't actually do it if you're actively making your loneliness pathetic. Sympathy is felt for problems, not so much for failing to deal with those problems. Stop feeling so bad for yourself, and others will be more likely to actually act when they feel bad for you.

I'm focusing on this until a certain stage of production where I become pretty much useless to the team, at which point I'll be a little less involved and probably try college again.

For years, my mother and I fought terribly, so when I fell in love with an incredible man, I took the opportunity to move in with him.\n\n\n\nWe work wonderfully together, and I love living with him. Now that I'm not living with mum anymore though, we get along a lot better. So some times I miss my mum and my sister, and ocassionally I really look forward to seeing them.\n\n\n\nMy boyfriend is working today, so yesterday I made plans with my sister for us to go to our local markets together and both get laksa (it used to be a saturday tradition before I moved out!), and something small for my mum, and go and visit her. Mum just had surgery on her arm, so she is in hospital.\n\n\n\n\nFirst thing this morning, I wake up (my boyfriend left for work an hour before) and find a message on my phone from him \"I hope you aren't going out today; you left your keys in my car\". Crap. Crap, crap, crap. Yesterday, he picked me up from home and we went to the shops together, so I'd taken my keys with me to lock the door, but obviously forgot when we got out of the car.\n\n\n\n\nI sent my sister a message telling her what had happened, and eagerly awaited her response hoping that maybe she would say that she would just pick me up! \n\n\n\n\nThe longer I waited though, the more I thought it would be unfair to ask that of her;  her house to mine is 27 minutes (cheers google maps). So she would have to drive 27 minutes to pick me up, 27 minutes back in to town, and then do that trip again when it was time to drop me home.\n\n\n\nOr, maybe she could pick me up, (27 minutes), drive to my boyfriends work (12 minutes), pick up my keys then drop me back home to my car (12 minutes) and then we could each drive back in to the city (27 minutes), but at least this way she wouldnt have to drop me home and do another hour loop!\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, she offered to do option 2. But by this time, I realised it was too much running around, and told her not to worry- it was my mistake, so my loss.\n\n\n\n\nShe offered again, called me, but I knew she didn't want to drive so far. Even once we were back in the city to get the laksa, it is a 20-something minute drive further to the hospital! I politely declined, saying I didn't want her to have to do my running around.\n\n\n\n\nShe was sorry, and felt bad that I'm stuck at home for the next 8 hours, and kept apologizing. That just made me even more upset, and feel even more sorry for myself.\n\n\n\nIt's such a pathetic reason to be so upset; it's my fault.\n\n\n\nI was just actually looking forward to seeing my mum and sister. I was super excited to have my first laksa in ages, and I liked the thought of us sitting in mums hospital room eating our laksa and joking around with the nurses and other ladies in mums ward. \n\n\n\nI didn't realise how much I wanted that plan until I could no longer do it, and now the sad, slow tears just keep coming. \n\n\n\n\nInstead of having a nice day with family, I'm stuck in my house with basically no food (I needed to grocery shop today!), and the weather is too terrible to even bother trying to go for a walk or ride outside.

They shouldn't even be considered family. I hate all of them. Starting with my dad, which I'm pretty sure caused most of my family to be fucked up, including me. I'm not sure what to call it. I don't think it's called abuse, but it might be. The police have been to my house quite a few times in the past 2 years. This isn't because my dad started acting terrible lately, but because I called them because I didn't know what else to do anymore. \t\n\nI can't remember every single time the police came because my memory is terrible, but I know that the last time was because he choked my mom and threw her on the bed, and I'm pretty sure the other times it had to do with my mom, too. I'm not strong enough to do anything so I figured after what I'm told has been years of him being a terrible person and getting away with it, I called them. It didn't do anything. Every time. Nothing happened to him. I think it's because he's a cop too. Well, they finally got a divorce a few months ago and he's gone now. My little sister goes to see him sometimes but not often. One day he tried to break into the house because I wouldn't let him inside since he doesn't live here anymore. He came through the window and let himself in. I pushed him out. This was during the time the divorce was still being worked out, and yet all he got was a warning from my mom's lawyer. He gets away with anything. \n\t\nIn the past he's done other shit. Hit my head against the wall because I woke him up with my coughing. That was a big one. No one cared. Not even my mom. Another thing I remember is my family telling me a lot of stories of him abusing my older sister emotionally and sometimes physically. I can't remember all the stories. I can't tell you guys everything about my dad anyway because it's just too much and I don't want my whole post being about him.\n\t\nNow that he is gone, my house is a lot less stressful. Me, my mom, little sister, and older sister visits for a few months every now and then since she lives out of state. My mom has a nice boyfriend. Now about the rest of my family. My little sister is the shortest because I don't know anything about her and I don't think anyone else does either. Sometimes I feel sorry for her, but she is a brat. But no one parents her. My mom and older sister scream at her and throw around empty threats, but that's it. She's up all night on social networks and sleeps all day after school. She is 11. I feel like my sister and moms scream at her and use her as a punching bag. I could be totally wrong.\n\t\nMy older sister is next. I'm convinced she is totally unstable. She acts like my mother and my little sister's mother and I hate it. Because she constantly fights with my mom for no good reason and makes the house more stressful to live in. She will cry and bitch and scream at everyone. Except me. Because now I don't get involved in their fights, because they are impossible to diffuse. She went through a lot as a kid, and I understand that. An unloving father, that hated her. I know what you're thinking. He didn't hate her. Yes he did. This isn't a good example at all, but they were texting one day when my mom and sister were out drinking. One thing lead to another and he said to her that she wasn't his daughter, and he wants nothing to do with her. This lead to a  fight which led to my dad choking my mom and the police coming. Sounds really stupid now that I'm typing it. Anyway, she is very mean to everyone. She starts the fights now that my dad is gone. Also, she lives really REALLY far away and I assume it is very emotionally draining for her. \n\t\nNow for my mom. I learned a while ago that she was actually addicted to cocaine for a while. My dad wrote it down on a sticky note and pinned it to his mirror before he left. He did this because my mom was writing inspirational things on sticky notes on her mirror, to see every morning. He responded by writing a LOT of garbage about her on his mirror that my little sister luckily didn't see. He's a fucking child. No, they did not share a room at this time. Anyway..yeah she has had some of her own issues. I will get to the major point that has been bothering me lately though. I have tried talking to her about my depression and stress and insanity twice in the past couple of months. The first time, she got angry with me for the drugs I've done. I didn't like this, and stopped talking to her. I was asking her to see a therapist, and I told her why because I thought she would help me. Wrong. The second time was a week ago. I told her how stressed I've been and apparently I didn't make a convincing argument for this, and she just told me that the REAL world is stressful. Basically, I'm a kid and my problems aren't problems until I'm out of college. Truly amazing. I always looked up on her. I used to be so sad that she was depressed. Now I tried talking to her and she gets angry and blows it off. \n\t\nThis leads to me believing that no one really cares about me. People say that people should try to talk to their family and friends about their problems because they'll be happy you tried talking to them. Dead fucking wrong. No one gives two flying fucks because there is other shit to stress about. I get that. Money is EXTREMELY tight and I'm going to a private school that costs a ton of money that my dad only pays half of for. I get that. She works all the time. I UNDERSTAND. But would it kill her to try and help me? \n\t\nThere is more to me being upset then just family. This is already so fucking long I'm sorry. School is terrible. Like for a lot of kids. I'm 16. 17 in two weeks. I hope this doesn't change anyone's opinion about me, because I'm really struggling with life. I had no friends except for people I play with on steam until sophomore year. I met my best friend then, and he and I introduced each other into pot. We both grew into it together. It was great. Then over the summer I started getting really bad  shakes from it. Kinda just live with it now. Can't find anything bad about it but then again I can't find anything on it at all. Weed kinda made life easier. It's like a mini vacation every night. I've only tried five drugs, and really the only ones worth mentioning are weed and shrooms because the others were only used once and it wasn't a big deal. I had magic mushrooms November, and I think it completely changed me. Whether that be for worse or better. I had a pretty bad trip, and ended up with serious depersonalization issues for a good month or two and now I'm good. It did so much more but I can't explain. I just think differently of people in a good way I think. Still smoking. Was going to get more shrooms tonight, but I can't get a ride anywhere since my only friends live at least a half hour away with a car. Sucks. I'm sorry I got so off track. School sucks because I hate the type of people I meet and everyone treats my shitty pathetic life as a joke. No one leaves me alone. It's not even bullying. They're just fucking stupid except for book smarts. I'm pretty stupid and I accept that but holy shit no one can take a hint that I don't find your jokes at me funny and I don't make jokes at you so fuck off. And no, I don't like any of you. Can I stop pretending to be your friend now?  It's an all guy school by the way. I mean it's better than public school in middle school..but I can't connect with anyone. The two kids that I did left. We still hang out every weekend though. That's cool. My grades are shit. I'm worried I won't make anything of myself and everyone will be disappointed at me because my family has so many fuck ups in it. I'm going to make nothing out of myself, and I'm dreading the day I finish high school and have no direction in my life. I don't know what I want to do yet. SATs are close and I haven't even started studying yet. I think I want to be a computer programmer because I love video games. Sometimes I think being a therapist or something would be nice though..simple. And I love talking to people about their problems because I like helping people that might be like me or worse. \n\t\nMy aunt died two weeks ago. She was on my dad's side and youngest of the siblings. She OD'd on heroine. I haven't seen my dad's side of the family in three years because they hate us apparently. That's what my mom said. They don't. I learned that at the funeral. Anyway. I haven't seen her in three years. She was fucking wonderful. She left behind her son who's 15. Terrible. i remember her being so nice as a kid..but I KNEW something was always off about her. I saw her for a total of 30 seconds at the funeral when the coffin was open. And that was it. I barely cried. I never cry anymore. It feels ridiculous and I embarrass myself. Of course I didn't feel this way at the funeral. \nBut I feel like I should have so much more emotion then this when a family member dies..too bad I don't see them anymore. I hated seeing my dad there. He talked to my family so easily. I refused to talk to him. I'm sorry I know a lot of people will say it's different because his sister died, but he is a terrible person and I don't want to talk to him. \n\t\n**TL;DR:** This has gotten ridiculously long so I'm going to try to make one paragraph about it all  because my thoughts are all over the place. I'm sorry, it's really hard to think and talk. Family doesn't care about me, and I think they need help because we are really dysfunctional. I'm doing terrible in school and I'm worried I won't get into any decent college now and I'll struggle the rest of my life with money. My girlfriend is really wonderful. Dating almost two years. She's depressed as hell too and her parents are so fucking mean to her its awful and they won't help her just like mine won't. I'm so moody all the time now. I think I've been depressed for a long time but I feel like someone would've asked me if i needed help by now..drugs make me over think everything and I feel like i'm losing my mind. I can't fucking think straight anymore. I don't even know why I'm typing all of this! Because I KNOW this is not what I wanted to talk about but I can't fucking explain what's been going on in my head. I feel insane. I don't fit in anywhere, life is frustrating, I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I'm so anxious and nervous all the time I can't socialize with new people because I can't speak my thoughts. It's like I'm losing social skills. I'm always alone now. Dealing with my own thoughts. I wish I had friends that lived close by. I had so many friends on steam but I'm so much different..I hate that the only thing I have in common with them is a game I play. We share nothing else. I feel like there might be something wrong with me, and I want to see someone for help but obviously as demonstrated above I cannot fucking speak my mind at all. Suicide just seems like such a logical option in times like these. If life is pointless, why am I stressing out and being sad over all of this pointlessness? I can't remember a time when I had a lot of friends and went out often honestly\u2026middle school I remember spending my entire summer on my computer. I'm terrible at socializing now. Who would want to be friends with me? I'm a fucking mess. So if anyone read any of this, are any of these problems real? Honestly. I'm pretty sure i'm just a lazy fuck. I don't know what depression really is, so how do I know if I'm depressed. I've lost interest in everything. Life is so boring without weed. I hate forcing myself to take a few days sober. I don't smoke everyday, but sometimes I go on for a few weeks. One final thing, I'm very convinced no one cares about me. I know people will say that's bullshit, but no one checks up on me. I've told so many people that I've been struggling. It's a one day conversation and then it's like it never fucking happened. I swear people are only out to help themselves, and my problems just drag them fucking down more. But it's perfectly fine for you to talk to me, because I'll actually fucking try to help out. Not just have a talk where I pretend to give a shit long enough for you to stop talking to me. I'm really sorry that this is a mess and I obviously can't think straight, so I'm just going to post this and see how it goes. I wish I could say everything, but it's too much and overwhelms me. I just forget about it eventually and bury it deeper. Again, I'm sorry if this seems like a ridiculous reason for being sad. Just had to do something. I have nothing going for me anymore..I'm so fucked when it comes to the real world I guess. I'm really worn out. I'm tired of being angry, sad, paranoid, and everything in-between everyday.

I met him in a college class last year and we hit it off. \n\nHis girlfriend, Rachel, is 23 and comes from a very strict household. She still lives at home, her father measures her skirts when she leaves the house, and she refers to her parents as \"Ma'am\" and \"sir.\" She seemed pretty cool, but it is often like hanging out with a 12 year old. She find any sex jokes to be forbidden. I am 18 and like to watch rated R movies and go to clubs when I can. \n\nDespite being on my own, with my own flat, working full time, and buying my own car... Rachel makes comments about me being a child. She says I cannot know what I want out of life and I need to find God to become a full member of society. It gets really annoying, but Brian likes her so I have sucked it up. But recently, I am rethinking whether or not I can handle this situation. \n\nShe is not abusive, she just thinks her views are the only ones that matter. She has Brian wearing clothing that is \"godly\" and has thrown out his old band shirts and anything with a mythical creature on it. She has been to my apartment a few times and told me that my painting of a dragon is innappropriate. I told her that she can either shut up about my apartment or leave. \n\nI am a modest person, for the most part. I don't flaunt my sexuality or wear revealing clothing. But Rachel is on a whole new level: jean skirts to her ankles, blouses with high necks, She won't show her wrists without feeling like she is doing something ungodly. I thought she was some form of Amish when I met her, but her hair is short and I am not sure what denomination she is from. \n\nEither way, she is very pretty, sweet, and motherly. Which Brian loves because he never really had someone give a crap about him. But even he thinks she goes over the line. \n\nRecently, Rachel asked to speak to me. She came to my apartment and told me that she thinks I am a bad influence on Brian. She wants him to be godly, but I make him falter. She also had some concerns about my behavior with him. \n\nI asked what they were. \n\n1. She thinks I dress provocatively. \n\n2. She thinks hugging Brian is not appropriate. \n\n3. She hates that I work. I should be getting married. \n\n4. She dislikes that I make jokes about sex. \n\n5. She hates my religion (buddhism) and thinks I am a witch.\n\nShe even wrote me a list of them, with Bible verses to help me overcome temptation. \n\nI am not sure how to approach Brian about my concerns. I don't know how many other people she has approached with these lists, but one friend did text me asking if I got the \"Five COmmandments\" of Rachel? \n\nHow do I approach him about how she is acting without seeming like I am being crazy? \n\n\n---   \n**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!","retrieved_on":1441934282,"ups":9,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/1woxc4/me_18_f_with_my_best_friend_22m_and_his/","link_flair_text":"[new]","author":"[deleted]","from":null,"is_self":true,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":5,"archived":true,"id":"1woxc4","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":"new","name":"t3_1woxc4","quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":9,"created":1391216272,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1woxc4/me_18_f_with_my_best_friend_22m_and_his/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false}

I've always thought about making a post here but it never seems to happen. I'm a long-time lurker. I'd like someone to talk to, but knowing me, it probably won't happen since I have a tendency to isolate myself from others. This might also turn out to be terribly long, so I doubt that anybody will really read it. I'm 23 years old and I just graduated from college.\n\nMy living situation is good. I am a telecommuter, and I work from home providing customer service over the phone. They pay isn't great, and the angry customers tend to be verbally abusive. I've only been doing this for a few weeks, as I do need a way to pay the bills while I look for a job that's \"in my field\". \n\nI have always been an imaginative person. My dad has always yelled at me for day dreaming when I should be paying attention. When I graduated from high school, I was a lot happier and more hopeful than I am now. I was going to college to be a nurse, and I would just sit in my human biology class looking at this beautiful poster of all these different sharks. I loved it. I always loved nature and animals. I began to think it would be wonderful to go to school to do something that I loved. I received all kinds of discouragement about how hard it is to be a scientist. I was told that the pay was terrible, that the job security isn't great, and that there aren't many openings. Academic advisors were mostly unhelpful and dismissive. In all of my naive glory, I took the leap and followed the advice of Confucius: do what you love and you'll never work a day of your life.\n\nI took an internship at the Department of Environmental Protection in my senior year and it was the most miserable \"job\" of my life. I spent 4-8 hours a week there doing monotonous, repetitive data entry into spreadsheets. They never gave me a chance to do anything enriching. It was miserable, and for the most part, the people who worked there seemed as miserable as me. They were constantly laying nice people off because they were underfunded. I left after spending a year there.\n\nDespite the bad experience, I worked my ass off on my degree. All the while, I began to grow weary of the entire thing. My senior research project was the best in my class, and I graduated in the top percentile of my peers with cum laude.\n\nDespite my accomplishments, I feel utterly devoid of any sense of achievement of motivation. I have not been able to find a job in my state, and I am absolutely crushed. I have severe medical depression, but I'm a very tenacious person so I have always fought it tooth and nail. I have never succumbed to it in any way, but I am starting to lose steam here. I'm so discouraged. I kept telling myself all of this time that everyone was wrong, and that I would prevail and do something with my dreams.\n\nMeanwhile, a lot of other things have gone to shit. Almost all of my friends are in horrible situations. They're all either addicted to drugs, horribly depressed, in abusive relationships, or something else that's just bleak as fuck. My parents are terribly unhelpful. My mother walked out on me when I was 14, and although we have kept in touch, the last time I tried to tell her what I was going through she found it appropriate to tell me about how \"God is the answer\" for forty minutes. She just talked at me about how I should stop being an atheist for forty minutes while I said nothing. My father is a recovered alcoholic and drug addict who has nothing to offer me as far as emotional support is concerned. His approach is \"tough love\", and I just can't take feeling like any more of a loser right now than I already do. My boy friend is a guy who is easily satisfied as long as he isn't starving and homeless, so depression is completely out of his ballpark and he never has anything to say to me. I feel like I can't even talk to my best friend. She is as depressed as I am and in the same position, but every time I try to bring it up with her, I feel like I'm making her feel worse and then I can add guilt to the laundry list of my problems.\n\nI feel so fucking alone, and I hate trying to make new friends. I almost always find other people to be disappointing and hard to relate to. Everyone who gets close to me loses interest or finds me disagreeable.\n\nThe thing that hurts me the most right now is that poster of the sharks. Someone I loved bought it for me a couple of years before I received my degree. He's now addicted to drugs, without a job, suicidal, without a degree, and living at his parents' house. He calls me all of the time because I'm his only friend, but hearing from him makes me sad. The poster is hanging behind where I sit when I work. I used to turn around and see it when I was finished studying, and it filled me with hope and reminded me of why I was working so hard. Now I turn around and see it when I'm done working, and all it does is remind me of what a failure I am and how everyone I love is suffering horribly. I want to take it down, but I think it would hurt me more to look at an empty space where the image that ignited my dream once rested.\n\nThe world is so ugly. I didn't think this was how my life would turn out to be.","id":"1woz49","archived":true,"name":"t3_1woz49","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":1,"is_self":true,"author":"[deleted]","from":null,"stickied":false,"created":1391217517,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qqqf","from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1woz49/i_feel_horrible_and_i_need_someone_to_talk_to/","from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":1391217913,"score":2}

I cross the same bridge everyday and try to walk down the middle just in case I decide to throw myself off before I get to class. Don't want to make any rash decisions. \n\n\nWhen I'm inside the engineering building I browse the internet in the computer lab until I'm five minutes late to my class. It assures that I have no awkward small talk and I have an excuse to sit in the back of the class. \n\n\nWhile listening to the lectures, I write down a few notes but after awhile I just doodle things to make me laugh or draw fractals for meditative purposes. It helps time pass by faster and to keep my mind off of suicide. As the professor implies class is almost over I pack up my note/sketches and rush back to the computer lab. I don't want to think too much about how I feel. I need to be mentally sedated for a little bit. I repeat this until my last class. \n\n\nI drive home and pick up a sandwich on the way back. I eat it in my grandmother's basement with the door closed while browsing the internet. If my family comes down, I say a \"yeah\" and \"okay\" until they leave and tell them \"I am busy with homework.\" I close the door and I go back to browsing the web hoping to find something that makes me smile. It's never enough. Now days it could take hours to find what I am looking for. \n\n\nWhen I finally get exhausted I lay on the bed listening to Netflix to make sure I don't have any thoughts of my own. When I am finally asleep, I dream about becoming information. My brain uploaded and my body is left behind. I am my god finally. \n\nI am master of the input until the morning where I repeat the same day. I've been repeating the same day for four years now.","media":null,"ups":36,"retrieved_on":1441934220,"created_utc":"1391219672","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"depression","domain":"self.depression","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"My College Experience","secure_media_embed":{}}

I'm 17, by the way.\n\nMy parents have been having financial troubles recently, and they were amplified when my dad made a mistake regarding how much money they had in their bank account, which caused them to go much deeper into their overdraft than they had intended.  I lent them $400 a week ago to fix that.\n\nWe had to cut back on groceries and some other things, but we knew it wouldn't be for long because my dad would be receiving a sum of money ($1100) from his ex-boss.  He was owed this money because he was laid off without notice, as well as a few other illegal things his boss did.  \n\nMy mom used to be a paralegal and has done hours of research into employment laws in our area.  His ex-boss was just making shit up (He told the mediator that he gave 2 weeks notice, and he told him that he gave 1 weeks notice, and he originally sent a letter in defense of his actions in which he mentioned that he wasn't aware notice was required).\n\nThere was **no fucking way** for my dad to lose this case, but he started talking himself out of it.  Last night he woke my mom up to ask \"What if he did give notice\", ignoring his boss' inability to stick to a lie.  My mom has been reassuring him for weeks that his case is rock fucking solid.\n\nToday, my mom got a call from a surprised mediator who told her that my dad had **called his fucking ex boss and decided to settle for $300**.  He went through with this despite what he agreed upon with my mom, and without bothering to notify her.\n\nThis isn't new behavior for him.  He's always been a spineless fucking pussy.  Not only does he hate conflict, but he hates anything that inconveniences him (including not being able to smoke around my asthmatic mother who is riddled with health issues, although he has since quit smoking).  I've never had such an issue with him failing as a parent (for an example, when asked to discipline me at age 3 by my mom, he slapped me in the face, not because he is malicious, but because he's fucking clueless) because I haven't needed a competent father.  My mother is wonderful and she's been more than enough to ensure that I am raised the right way.  What infuriates me is when he fails as a husband.\n\nHere's an example - before I was born, my siblings lived with him and my mom.  My mother took them and moved out because of his drinking, drugs, and gambling (he gambled away the college funds of my siblings).  She was forced to move back in with him because he just **up and stopped paying the fucking mortgage on the house they owned jointly**.  I'm getting super pissed just relaying this, if I was my age at the time this happened, I would have marched down to that house and broke his fucking arm.\n\nI could go on forever about why he sucks, but the one thing I've always respected about him is that, even if I've never really liked him as a person, he's always been able to provide for his family (at least while I've been alive, he was even more of a disgusting piece of shit before that, but I've said enough about that).\n\nAnyways, when he told us about his decision, I went off on him a little and demanded to know how he could be so careless financially when he just borrowed $400 from me last week.  His response was \"It made me feel lighter, it didn't feel like something I should do\"  So his piece of mind was more important than providing for his family.  Again, I'm not pissed because I think he's failing me, I'm 17, I have a job, and I could move in with my older brother if my parents lose their house.  But my mother has piles upon piles of health issues, so much so that taking a 5 minute walk every day is hell for her.  She can't work, she can't even work from home anymore.  She relies on him to not be such a fuckup.  Shit, I wouldn't be surprised if half of her illnesses resulted from the stress of living with him for so many years.\n\nThis turned out to be much longer than I intended, and I apologize for the dragged-out rant, but I'm almost too pissed right now to formulate coherent thoughts.  My dad sucks.  Discuss?  Tell stories of your shitty parents?  Tell stories of your great parents to show how parenting can be done right?

My goal was to lose 1 lb a week.  \n  2) Diet  \n\t-Goal was to reduce carbs to ~45% of my food intake  \n\t-Breakfast was either one packet of instant oatmeal or fried egg whites with one yolk and bacon or\n          sausage.  And plenty of coffee with cream and sweet n low.  \n\t-Lunch was a pre-packaged salad kit (I preferred Fresh Express salad kits) and sometimes a side of fish or\n          grilled chicken breast  \n\t-Dinner was whatever my wife made  \n\t-No alcohol except red wine and only on weekends (I've since learned that whenever I drink any amount of\n          alcohol I will not loose weight that day)  \n\t-I had to give up certain foods as I discovered I was addicted to sugar (no more donuts, milk chocolate, brownies, etc.).  I still eat dark chocolate though.  \n\t-When eating at a restaurant, the order in which I selected my entr\u00e9es was always in this order of preference:  salad -&gt; fish -&gt; poultry -&gt; meat -&gt; pasta  \n\t-My wife eliminated High Fructose Corn Syrup, MSG, and other bad chemicals from our diet.  We eat mostly organic fruits and vegetables now as well. I'll still drink Coke Zero though.  \n3) Exercise  \n\t-I downloaded runtastic! to track all the walking I did  \n\t-I inserted walking into my daily routine to replace instances where I drove or took a bus/shuttle to work.  At my max I was walking 9 miles a week day (with weekends off).  I'm closer to 4-6 miles a day now.  \n\t-My sole purpose for walking was so I could eat more (1600 calories a day is rough so I needed more)  \n4) Check ins  \n\t-I weight myself twice a day, 12 hours a part.  Once before breakfast and once before dinner.  This lets me judge how well I'm doing for the day.  \n\t  \n**Physical changes I noticed:**  \n  \n1) Every 10 lbs I lost my waist decreased 1\"  \n2) I plateaued at 205 lbs for 3-4 months.  It took a lot of will power to not get discouraged.  I now know this was my body adjusting to a new weight set point.  \n3) I had to relearn proper posture and even walking correctly  \n4) As my body adjusted to my new weight, I pinched my sciatic nerve and was bed ridden for two days  \n5) I still have some loose skin around my waist  \n  \n**What motivated me:**  \n  \n1) Co-worker was able to lose at least 40 lbs just my tracking his caloric intake  \n2) Working with a bunch of 20 year olds that could eat and drink whatever they wanted and still be skinny  \n3) Realizing that besides my age being overweight held a negative stigma at my job (I have since left that toxic environment)  \n4) Shame and a bit of depression  \n\n(Sorry for the formating.

Since then, I've been acquiring movies regularly; however, as a college student with limited funds, I found myself with /u/jdressen at our local Pawn Shop. I've come to find out that I can find fantastic dvds for $1-2 a pop at the at this place.

Or, Mortal Kombat, just because it's so bad, yet so awesome.\n\n**My least favorite movie I own is:**\n\nAs of right now, I'm not very happy with The Great Gatsby. I just couldn't get into it. I love DiCaprio, but it just lost me.\n\n**My favorite director:**\n\nDavid Fincher. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is easily one of my favorite movies (don't judge). I just love the story and Brad Pitt is wonderful.\n\n**What release I'm most proud of:**\n\nI'm most proud of all of the Pixars that I've been able to find at Pawn Shops. Why would anyone ever sell them?!\n\n**What releases I'm looking for:**\n\nI don't have any dvds that I'm specifically looking for. I like going into Pawn Shops blindly and finding something that peeks my interest.\n\n**How do you organize &amp; sort your\ncollection?

I did notice though as he was turning to leave/run to his room that he had a raging hardon in his shorts. \n\nNow's the weird part. I'm horny as hell. And I can't stop thinking about how embarassing it is that my brother saw me masturbating. But I'm also really turned on by it. I'm fantasizing now about putting myself in a position to where he'd find me doing it again. And maybe this time initiating something with him.\n\nI've had sex before. I had a boyfriend last year and he was my first. I lvoed having sex with him but he moved to New York and so there's nothign relaly to do about it. We snapchat each other dirty pics and stuff but that's about it.\n\nOh I need to mention that after a few minutes I was still turned on as hell and so I laid in bed and finished myself. But when i was doing i heard my brother get in the shower upstairs and I just know he was jerking off to me. I dont' know what to do but is wanting to sleep with my brother un natural? We'vebeen close while growing up but I don't want to fuck anythign up. \n\nThanks. \n\n-S","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1441934197,"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1391220933","subreddit":"sex","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.sex","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"I can tell my younger brother wants to have sex with me.

Its Friday night and I have nothing better to do right?\n\nThis should be pretty interesting because\n1. I am a Christian\n2. I plan on going back to school to become a preacher, but at this   point I do NOT have any formal training.  I have preached sermons before, but it was at a Charismatic church that didn't need you to be ordained. \n3. I am for the most part pretty conservative.\n4. I am a Live Sound Engineer for my main career.\n\n  These 3 things alone mean that we will all have a great time tonight.\n\nBackground on myself\n\nI HATED high school and college, so my spelling and grammar are not the greatest. I am working on it, but for now I apologize for that ahead of time. \n\nI was saved when I was 14. Pretty much the youth pastor at my church told us a story about a girl from another girl dying in a car crash and asking us if we knew we would go to heaven or not.  The fear got me at first. \n\nThe way I was saved became obvious as I grew up.  I had a spiritual disconnect in my late teens.  Rebelled against my parents at 15-23ish.  I smoked, dipped, chewed, drank, cussed, sexy times, and of course hit the bong.  I began to look at everything in life a bit differently, I stopped going to church COMPLETELY!  In college I considered myself to be leaning more towards Christianity, but I was more or less agnostic. All of that coupled with a few bad life experiences I was what you would call a hypocrite. \nA) No prayer\nB) No Faith\nC) I was just kinda living and hoping I would be a good enough person\n\nWhen I was 22 I got married and went to Church with my now EX mother in-law.  It was a Southern Baptist Church and the sermon was about drinking, and how Jesus actually turned water into WINE, and how drinking a beer isn't a sin.  This is something I had never learned in a Baptist church so this got me thinking.\n\nI still didn't go to church often.  Actually I put it off until 1.5 years later. The next time I went to Church the person running the sound was absolutely horrible, and it was feedback HELL. Me being a Sound Engineer offered to train the person (in a very polite way. \"Hey kid want some pointers?  I love your EQ for the snare... blah blah blah.\") and I ended up with the gig.  I sheltered myself most of the time behind the sound board, but overtime I began to listen and understand the true meaning and mission of Christians, and that should be love.\n\nAt 24.5 years old I proclaimed my love for Jesus, got baptized, went on a Walk to Emmaus, read the entire Bible cover to cover just to see if I could. (I will never read it like that again.) and decided I wanted to be a Baptist preacher.\n\nSince that time I have had more life problems then I can count.  I have lost close family members and friends.  I have had a divorce.  I lost some inheritance. I remarried, but my wife and I have had huge unexpected financial burdens.  We also had a miscarriage a few months ago, and hey life happens.\n\nThis time I have kept my Faith!  BTW I am 28 just incase yall wanted to know.\n\nI think it is important for you guys to know what I want out of this.\n\n1. Debate is bound to happen, but I would like it to be more like friends talking and having a couple of drinks.\n2.Laughter and good humor.  Life sucks when it is to serious... so do reddit debates and AMAs \n3. If a preacher comes on here and says they aren't trying to convert someone they are LYING... Lying in church is a sin, and lying on the internet is too! Obviously I know that most of yall have your minds made up.  Most of the people who are brave enough to post are set in stone, but maybe for me a lurker will read this and maybe take some of what I say to heart, who knows?\n\nIF yall are down Lets Discuss!!!!\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT:Guys I have been at this since 9pm and it is now 1:10 am where I live.  I would like to thank you all for the great discussion.  It was very insightful and I had fun.  My prayers thoughts and good wishes are with you guys, and I hope we can talk again soon!**\n\n\n\n","media":null,"domain":"self.atheism","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1391221994","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"atheism","title":"A Thiest and an AThiest walk into a bar....","secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1wp5b2/a_thiest_and_an_athiest_walk_into_a_bar/","created":1391221994,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","edited":1391238484,"score":0,"quarantine":false,"name":"t3_1wp5b2","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":"baby","id":"1wp5b2","archived":true,"num_comments":105,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"shiningilluminations"}
{"retrieved_on":1441934172,"ups":7,"media":null,"selftext":"I'm 17 and I decided to be a firefighter a while ago.\nMy plan has always been EMT School, followed shortly by the fire academy at my local city college (fresno, ca). From there I've planned on volunteering, earning a degree, and taking extra fire classes until some city department on the west coast decides to hire me. I'm on track to start the explorer program with Clovis FD pretty soon as well. But I recently talked to someone a little bit about military firefighting as a possibility. I've always been intrigued by the military, and it seems like taking the military route is much more secure and less competitive than the municipal route. I also understand that at the end of my six year stint, the CA state fire marshal will convert my military certifications and issue me my CA 1 certification(s), and my six years of experience will hopefully be a ticket to a civilian department. One concern I have is the lack of guarantee. There is no way I'm signing up for the military without being 100% sure that there's a firefighting job for me afterwards. But I've been told I can usually work something out with a recruiter, especially if I have a high ASVAB score. So if anyone with military firefighting experience can give me a little advice or information about differences between military and and civilian firefighting, pertaining to such things as environment, types of calls, frequency of calls, lifestyle, and especially information about getting started in military firefighting, it would be very helpful.

{"selftext":"Hi Reddit! I am 22 years old and unreasonably scared of the dentist, for starters. I have had a lot of cavities- probably about 8 or 9. I do brush and floss every day, although I didn't floss every day until I was 18. I am now religious about it- at the very least, I brush twice a day and floss once. I still get cavities, and now I'm not so sure what I have-- \n\nThe short story is--- I thought I might have a cavity. I went to the dentist and was told I had four. He did the fillings for all four (two on November 3rd, and two on November 9th). Once of them was in terrible pain. Just, terrible, afterwards. I could not sleep. I could not eat without painkillers. I was crying constantly. I went back to the dentist and he filed them down. I went back again and he did the same. I was still in terrible pain, and he said the only reason he kept on seeing me was because he felt I was being sincere (and I was- the pain was undeniable). \n\nFinally, I went back a third time and he said I probably had a root canal. He seemed very unsure- almost like he kind of made something up from the x-ray. He told me he'd give me antibiotic and then he wanted me to get a root canal (I can't really afford a root canal, so I expressed I was concerned about this). He then told me that I should not have so many cavities at my age, and that I should consider if I was experiencing psychosomatic symptoms. Needless to say, I was offended at the end of our appointment, but I was nice in return and just happy to get some antibiotic, honestly. He told me the antibiotic was \"just to see\" and that I could try it if I wanted, so I did. \n\nA week of antibiotic (and oh my goodness the diarrhea, holy shit...) and I feel 95%. A few days more and I'm 100% and so thankful to feel better. Now, six weeks later, my tooth starts to hurt again. It just started tonight, about five hours ago, but I'm really freaking out because it feels a little bit how it used to, when the pain started. I'm very scared because I know how bad the pain is, and I'm scared of the dentist, plus this last one was terrible to me in the end. \n\nReddit-- how can i know if it needs a root canal? How much time should I give it? What are my best options???

A love for this guy I've been incredibly interested in for something like five years is coming to an end. It's a long weird story and not the point. He and I are friends, everything is more or less good between us, he just doesn't care about me in the same why I (until very recently) cared about him. And I've grown to trust that and move on. \nWell, I'm 18. I haven't liked somebody else as much I liked him. And that's okay. I'm okay with that and I don't regret one bit of it.                      \nBut I'm veryvery scared. I've never had an actual boyfriend and I can't seem to hold onto any kind of hope. I very much want someone to share life things with. Even if it's temporary, or doesn't end up working out. I want to feel like there's somebody intelligent and attractive and kind who is as into me as I am to them. And I want to feel like I love someone again. The problem is that I can't muster up any hope that it will happen. Wynona Judd's Strongest Weakness comes to mind. \nNow, rationally speaking, I know that there's every possibility that I WILL find someone and I will fall in love and I'll have someone to share life with.

It's about forming a community within the walls of Reddit and making friends and forging bonds.\" \n\nFucking. Sweet! To me, it doesn't occur to lie on the Webbernets! I dunno why. I've always been transparant and I have no desire to role play. It's nice to meet a community who also holds these same ideas, and I'm excited to say hello. Not to sound naive, I just like bein' m'self and real. So let's forge a bond!\n\nSO HELLO! My name is Lauryn, or you can call me KupoLove. I'm 29 and live in Ohio. My user name comes from the Final Fantasy game series. If you haven't played the series before, 'Kupo' is the greeting from Moogles, little cat-dragon familiars who are there when ya need them, fierce and adorable. I know that Moogles are mythical and imaginary creatures, but they are definitely my spirit animal. And 'love' is how I approach everything around me. A personal motto of mine is to do it with love - so to give without strings, forgive to move on, to put someone else's happiness into consideration and as the rules say \"be excellent to one another.\" That;s pretty much why I subscribed to this thread.\n\nMy I work and have no husband or kids. I am also in school working on my associates degree. For a myriad or reasons, I've progressed late into my academic career, but at least I'm getting it done. My life's goal includes being joyous. And that umbrella includes eating dinner with friends at home, physical activity (Im a huge hiker, worker-outer, and general playing and having fun-er), playing music, and constantly learning.\n\nAt 22, I was diagnosed with PCOS, a hormone imbalance and body-general-unhappiness due to overactive ovaries. This explained a lot why I was moody and sick and unable to deal with minor life stresses. After a large ovarian tumor removal at 22, I continued to seek treatment for mood disorders. Life is stressful, yes, and I has some particular concrete stressors in the shape of poor family and friend support, and the inability to deal with it because of my own depression. Now at 29, I'm working everyday toward being a whole person and I am closer than ever. I am wicked proud of my own successes and coming back from 'the edge' many, many times. So, I haven't finished school, no. But I am on my own path of growth that frankly I am so proud of, I'll shout it from the rooftops. \n\nFor hobbies, I am a huge metal fan. I am a huge music fan, actually. I can appreciate a lot of music even if I don't love it. So, I *love* metal music. My favorite band is Opeth. Under that joyous life umbrella, touring in a band and playing shows is there. I feel this fucking electric-jello in my chest whenever I go  to shows and see people play live, and that jello tells me you need to do this, you can do this too. But, as with anyone, money is an issue for me and I'd like to buy some nicer gear to play with. Right now I have an Ibanez RG series guitar with a locking floyd rose tremolo, and it makes it difficult to change tuning (like a lot of metal can require). I won't be a self-actualized person until I make an album and get my music on record. \n\nI also enjoy photography. I guess in music, photos, even my tattoos, I view them as a life diary. It validates all my hard work I have put into myself and the people and things in my life. So, my photography is for chronology, memory and expression, not necessarily commercial or art-showcase stuff.\n\nI guess I could say a lot more about myself, but this is getting pretty indeapth as it is. So please ask me anything! I would love to make friends like me, nothing like me and everything in-between. So say hello!","media":null,"domain":"self.Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1391226390","author_flair_text":" http://amzn.com/w/35JG7F2GR2N5D","media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","title":"[INTRO] New here.

I'm told I'm attractive, I notice positive reaction from when I talk to guys, so I don't think it's my appearance that has prevented me from going out with guys. I get approached by guys that I'm not really attracted to and apparently I'm rude/mean to them by not engaging in deep convo (I will do small talk, I'm not that rude) or grinding on them at a club, but I honestly think I'm being real when I decide to not lead on someone I'm not interested in.
