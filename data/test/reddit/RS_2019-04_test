The embryo has attached into my uterus and they estimate it at 8 weeks based on a placental measure.\n\nThe thing that I cannot understand is that I had a full, normal period starting February 21st, so it seems impossible to have an 8 week pregnancy. \n\nAnd 10 days ago, I also had a significant amount of bright red bleeding during sex. Enough to soak through the sheets and enough to fill a pad. It happened the day before my expected period, so I assumed it was just a \u201cjump start\u201d induced by sex. \n\nLast night I went to urgent care because of the positive pregnancy test with an IUD. After an ultrasound, it was determined that this wasn\u2019t ectopic. They also didn\u2019t believe me that I had a full menstrual cycle in February because they believe the pregnancy to be at 8 weeks.\nIs it possible this is wrong? I know the difference between a period and spotting. February was cramps, followed by heavy flow over the course of a week. My period has been like clockwork for 5 months. \n\nI have concerns about continuing this pregnancy. The menstrual bleeding, the bright red bleeding, the IUD was removed last night, and also, I am 6 months postpartum from my second unplanned c-section. The first was an emergency c-section 3 years ago. The second was a failed induction 6 months ago. During the second c-section it was discovered that the scar tissue from the first c-section fused to my bladder, so a new internal incision was made. The OB last night told me that this is a high risk pregnancy for my own health because of my history and also, due to the IUD extraction, it has a high risk of miscarriage. (Last night after the IUD removal I had clumps of stringy bloody material coming out of me, not sure if that\u2019s normal for IUD removal or a miscarriage?)\n\nTo make matters worse, I still have postpartum depression.\n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m so lost and I can\u2019t believe this is happening. I got the IUD to specifically avoid this. \n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"breakingmom","subreddit_id":"t5_2y6ap","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/breakingmom","subreddit_subscribers":44253,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Pregnant despite IUD: Update","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/breakingmom\/comments\/b7un61\/pregnant_despite_iud_update\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I also have PTSD from friends and loved ones dying in the hospital. I would like to know what to expect from my pulmonology appointment in April. I am 33, female, overweight, and have asthma. I have had asthma since I was 12. 2\/7-2\/9 of this year was my first time being hospitalized for it. They put me on decodron and later prednisone after being on prednisone from 1\/30. I was on prednisone for 20 days. I got an abscess and cellulitis of the umbilical area from it. Due to these health issues I had four CT on the span of a month. Then from 3\/23-3\/26 of this year I was hospitalized again. This time they just gave me prednisone 50 mg and made me suffer with wheezing. I was getting breathing treatments every four hours and still wheezing. Once I got out of the hospital, I saw my allergy and asthma doctor who said there isn\u2019t anything he can do as I\u2019m on Symbicort, Spiriva, Singulair, Xopenex (inhaler and nebulizer), and something that starts with Ipa which is for a nebulizer too. He upped my prednisone from 40mg to 60mg because I was wheezing so bad in his office. So back to my question: besides the evil sleep apnea study (which I\u2019ve had twice in the past and have never been positive for it), what should I expect from my first meeting with the pulmonologist in a few weeks? Also, last year on a CT, they found a lot of small modules less than 3mm in diameter when getting me prepared for an appendectomy. I don\u2019t know if the current CT scans show this or not as it depends who is reading the scans. For instance, I had an abscess that was draining and a lot of cellulitis. The CT scan didn\u2019t show this the second time. It kept draining for 2 weeks afterward.

I have no hope of convincing her to have me weaned me off the drug to see if i can handle myself but maybe i can convince her to switch it to something that isn't harmful. I've looked into treatments like theanine and magnesium, but didn't notice any benifit from them. And as for hypnosis, acupuncture, and accupressure. My mom wouldn't even let me try them because she assumed it would be ineffective because she knows people who have tried those for other health problems who say \"It didn't work\" or \"I didn't notice anything\". Then you have marijuana which isn't even legal in the state i'm in even for medical reasons. But there was CBD oil which i did take, but i was taking it while already taking invega so i didn't notice anything other than feeling less hungry and my mom says \"If it was helping you would have noticed something\" which is fucking stupid because it's clear she doesn't understand the effects of psychiatric drugs like invega and how they are very harmful long term, otherwise she wouldn't have me taking it in the first place. But she refuses to listen, saying \"You'll never completely get off of medicine, you need something in you for your OCD\". She won't even let me lower the dose of the drug to see how i perform, she's so badly brainwashed by doctors and \"Big Pharma\" it's hysterical. She acknowledges the fact that opiods are highly addictive and result in alot of fatal overdoses and how doctors hand them out like candy but doesn't acknowledge the severe and potential permanent side effects of antipsychotics and how most psychiatrists lie about their harmful effects, making her a massive hypocrite. But back to the original topic, me and my mom looked into exposure therapy but couldn't find any doctor that did it that my insurance would pay for, and the treatment was very expensive so my mom couldn't pay for it out of pocket. It's one of the many things that suck about living in a rural town.  Would blood pressure medicine be something that could relieve the strong sensation of panic and anxiety? I don't want to get rid of intrusive thoughts, as i believe it's unhealthy to avoid thoughts that offend you, rather you should learn to face them or cope with them. At this point i'm stumped, have any of you guys have had severe OCD or know anyone who has it and successfully treated it? If so, what was the method or treatment? It would be highly appreciated as i'm not sure where else to turn for help.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Antipsychiatry","subreddit_id":"t5_2to28","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Antipsychiatry","subreddit_subscribers":3081,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Do you know any alternative treatments for severe OCD?","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Antipsychiatry\/comments\/b7urfc\/do_you_know_any_alternative_treatments_for_severe\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

Right away, I knew this new manager was just plain incompetent - it was clear as day this guy just had NO f-ing clue how to do his job as his questions were that ask of someone \"new\" to the industry (not of someone who's been doing this for 20+ yrs).  I basically had to teach him how to do his job, my job, and he somehow convinced upper management that I should be the one to train\/mentor junior staff as part of \"my\" development.  (training juniors was what he was hired to do, BTW)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso the story: April rolls around (5 months after \\[boss\\] started), and I was having a particularly shitty day.  I was to leave for a week long vacation the following week, and \\[boss\\]'s project was going down the shit hole that I needed to fix before I left.  I got up, walked over to my friend \/ coworker (lets call him Larry) to bitch about \\[boss\\], and then went down to grab lunch.\n\nOn my way up, i bumped into \\[boss\\] as he was heading to the restroom, I smiled politely and said hi.  he looked away, kind of flustered and didnt really respond back. and i'm thinking, what got stuck up his butt??  \n\nSo i go back to my desk to text Larry with: \"Hey, I just bumped into \\[boss\\], and he's acting all weird towards me. I wonder if he knows I've been badmouthing him??\"   Nothing too crazy or incriminating.  I could have said: my idiot boss was acting weird, but for some reason (which i'm very glad of), i kept it very mild.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Of course, after i sent the text, i realized i actually sent it to \\[boss\\] !  i guess my mind was thinking about \\[boss\\] and choose his name on the list rather than my friend's!**  totally mortified and embarrassed, I ran into his office and apologized.  he was of course very agitated and offended (i don't blame him).  he asked me why i sent it.  I told him \"I was really annoyed when you told me XYZ about the project, so i went to rant to my friend about it, that was it.\"  He didnt believe me (again, i dont blame him).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, I go on my vacation, and when i got back, everything seemed fine.  Then the shit hits the fan!  The company's CEO (we're a small office) went into \\[boss\\]'s office, shut the door and they were talking for a very long time.  CEO then goes to EVP's office (he's my boss's boss), and they also shut the door and talk for a very long time, and as soon as CEO leaves, EVP requests a meeting w\/ me.  (UH OH!)\n\nI go into his office, and he said: \"So, I heard about the text you sent to \\[boss\\], and no only that, CEO has also learned of this text.\"  in my head, i'm thinking: \"wow, what a dick move!!!  why did he have to show it to EVP and CEO??!  why couldnt he just let it go!?\"\n\nNeedless to say, i got into serious trouble.  I've been working at this company close to 10 years at this point, and the EVP and CEO both think of me fondly. I am 1 of their top employees, so I got to say, I got off easy (essentially a slap on the wrist).  \n\nEVP told me I \"absolutely cannot let this happen again, and if it does, forget about switching departments (I had put in a transfer request with the CEO a month earlier), I would have to switch companies.\" (essentially saying they would fire me if it did).  He told me I need to \"learn to get along with him, and if i can't, i should go find a new company to work for.\"\n\nI was flabbergasted to say the least.  How could EVP choose to defend new incompetent employee of 5 months, over his star employee of 10 years?  I was so pissed off from that \"reprimand\" that when I went home, I updated my resume and applied to jobs that very week.\n\nWhen I gave the EVP my resignation at the end of June, he was shell shocked and could not believe i was resigning. he asked me why.  I told him: well you told me if i couldnt get along w\/ \\[boss\\], then I should go find a new company, and that's what i did.\"  he looked like i slapped in him in the face.\n\nI started my new job shortly after, and found out (through my ex-coworkers) that \\[boss\\] got fired less than a month after I left.  I guess upper management finally saw for themselves how incompetent \\[boss\\] was when I was no longer there doing all of his work for him.\n\nAnd to think, if he never showed the text to CEO or EVP, i likely would have stayed, and he likely would have kept his job....karma comes full circle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I accidentally sent a text to my incompetent boss that i was bad-mouthing him. he shows text to CEO and EVP.  I got reprimanded and quit.  Incompetent boss ended up getting fired shortly after i left when upper management finally realized I was carrying him the whole time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"tifu","subreddit_id":"t5_2to41","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/tifu","subreddit_subscribers":14463882,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"TIFU by texting my boss, about my boss...","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tifu\/comments\/b7ut9a\/tifu_by_texting_my_boss_about_my_boss\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

I barely talk to the people who I used to spend my life with. I mean, once every couple of weeks and nothing very deep. I've never been someone with a big circle of fiends, maybe 3-4 close friends at a time. I also tend to grow distant from my friends when in a relationship, and I got married about 2 years ago.\n\n I thought I was feeling shame\/guilt\/loss for my current situation, but now I think maybe it's just society's pressure to have friends that has me feeling that way? I am 27, happily married, a home owner, and comfortable with money. Currently taking time to save\/travel before my husband and I truly settle down and have kids. I fear that I can't relate to people my age. They're all looking for love or working on their careers or trying to find themselves or being a carpool parent or hustling to afford rent. Aside from this friend problem, I really have no problems, nothing to vent or relate about. The idea of getting drunk and staying out late like I did just a few years ago is very unappealing now, but so is getting coffee in the morning or doing yoga or getting brunch. Socializing feels like a task, I have one good friend who I enjoy talking to but everyone else I keep up with is just out of the fear of being isolated.\n\nAre social networks making me feel shame for something I truly don't care about right now? I have to admit, seeing past friends post pictures with tons of other friends gives me a little pang of shame. My husband also has a LOT of friends, which makes me feel like a reject for having only 1 or 2. In the future when we do have children, I hope to know the neighbors wherever we move and the other moms at school and form friendships with people who have things in common with me, people to 'do life with'. Right now, I feel like there is no one that is on the same page as me enough to truly do life with me, besides my husband. Is it okay for me to let go of these negative feelings about my lack of friends until I'm at a more relatable place in life?

I'm a fan of labeling my feelings and experiences, so I'd like to pin whatever it is I'm feeling to the wall.\n\nEver since I hit puberty (age 11), I've always hated my vagina.  I thought it was gross and weird, and the idea of receiving vaginal sex disgusted me.  Right off the bat, I began reading yaoi fanfiction (eep), and fantasizing about what it'd be like to have a dick.  I never, ever fantasized about anything to do with my vagina.  Now I'm 21, and the first time I tried penetration on myself was age 18; it was painful, but okay.  The pain has never gone away (probably due to my PCOS), it's actually gotten worse.  For a few months I fantasized about one specific scenario with me having a vagina, but that's gone now.  I like the thought of anal sex 100x better than vaginal sex, also (and I find it more pleasurable, from what I've experimented with).    \n\nFrustratingly, almost all my kinks are centered around HAVING a penis.  My sexuality is very important to me, and it makes me really upset to know I can't even begin to do a fraction of the things I've wanted to do for nearly a decade.  I'm pansexual, and I like vaginas on other girls just fine (they don't do it for me even half as much as dicks do, but I like the female body better than a man's), so it's not a dislike of all vaginas - just mine.  And I've been OK with having a vagina, for the most part, up until recently.  If it were possible for me to transform into a guy, I'd do it, but I don't think there's any chance I'd ever pass; not with how I look.  So I barely even consider it.  \n\nWhen I was a kid, I was always a tomboy.  I liked rough and tumble play, messing around in the dirt, playing soccer - and I exclusively hung out with boys.  I never really felt like I related to girls, and I still kind of don't.\n\nI don't like the idea of being a girl in a relationship with a guy.  I'm slightly more OK with the idea of being a girl with another girl, but I'd still much prefer to be a guy.  I'm particularly confused, because my comfort level of being a girl varies depending on the situation (but I'd always prefer to be a guy).  \n\nI love feeling masculine, and I hate feeling feminine.  I hate being seen as a female out in public - makes me uncomfortable and annoyed - but it doesn't particularly bother me when I'm with my family.  I've always hated skirts, dresses, and makeup - more so to make a point than anything else.  I don't hate those things because they're unattractive or stupid, I hate them because when I wear or use them it makes me seem more feminine.  \n\nI wish I didn't have breasts, no matter how small, or wide hips.  I'm really happy whenever I see something on me that makes me less feminine (e.g. leg hair, thin lips, upper lip hair, big hands and feet, etc), but it makes me self-conscious to show some of those things off in public (namely the hair).  Actually, when I imagine myself as a guy, I imagine myself as a fairly baby-faced one (like I am now).  Oftentimes I think 'I'm never going to look the way I want to, so why even bother trying'; I'm a girl, I'm never going to look like a guy.  I might as well be sloppy and not take care of myself, because I don't even want a romantic or sexual relationship with the way I am (I do want to take care of my health, but that's an upwards battle with my depression).  I don't want to look like a sexy girl or a cute girl, I want to look like a guy - no matter how feminine that guy may be.  I feel like, if I was a guy and \\*I\\* knew I was a guy, I wouldn't care if people saw me as a girl.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?                            \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"offmychest","subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/offmychest","subreddit_subscribers":1493192,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I wish I had a penis and that I was a guy; I really want a label","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/offmychest\/comments\/b7uwe6\/i_wish_i_had_a_penis_and_that_i_was_a_guy_i\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

I don't know what to do anymore, my family and I have been struggling with earning enough money and trying to get by for quite some time now. Most of my high school years were spent waking up at 3 am, going to school and getting picked up by my parents right after school was over in order to get home \"early\" and not catch any traffic. It is my first year in college and I am still doing this with my father and younger brother (he's 16). Due to this, it was almost impossible for me to get a job in my late high school years as my family only had access to one car, and the area (neighborhood) where I live in mexico is limited with opportunities and not very safe at all. Also, I want to clear up that I am aware of the fact that I am not the only student crossing the border everyday to go to school, there are probably hundreds if not more. The point of this post is a reach out for help, for advice anything. I've struggled with anxiety, depression almost my whole life and have recently began to have suicidal thoughts and feel as I am becoming a burden to my family by not doing much despite being a full time student. My father is a painter and has had trouble being able to find a job recently and my mother is unable to work due to a spinal injury and having had breast cancer in the past (she is cancer free now). I don't know how much longer I can keep up with the routine and I feel trapped, like I am in a constant loop. I personally feel like my father has fallen into a state of depression and won't admit it. He has fallen into a slump and will sometimes go days without showering and has recently spent a lot of his time in bed now. It breaks my heart to see them like this and I really don't know what else to do at this point, I feel lost and alone. Also, not a single one of my friends knows the truth about where I live and what I do, nobody, not even the people I have called my closest friends. I've contemplated telling them, but I always end up keeping it to myself.\n\nI don't want anyone to think that I am posting this for sympathy, I am genuinely looking out for some help, advice, anything at this point. I will definitely be out job searching for once, but I don't know were to start or how to start since I only have a high school diploma. I really just needed a place to vent for once, because I feel like I've kept this buried all up inside of me for far too long.\n\nSome questions that I do have:  \n1. I'm currently majoring in Computer science (Cyber Security), but it might take me around 3-4 full years to transfer to a UC\/CSU since I have a ways to go with prerequisites and math. My grades are surprisingly looking great, but then again it is only my second semester, should I stick with this plan or do something else? I genuinely am interested in my major, but I am not sure if I can afford to stay for THAT long, especially with the current situation I am dealing with. Would it be worth it to stay?\n\n2. What are some jobs that I can get as a 19 year old college student with only a high school diploma. Are there any good ways to make cash online?\n\n3. What are some things that I can learn or do NOW that can better my future self or boost my income for the later years.\n\nAlso once again, I really apologize if this post was a mess. I'm doing everything I possibly can to find some help and advice. I know that it will not be easy for me, I know I might struggle a bit, but I need a change, I need something, anything.

As always come with some ideas and we can get something going. \n\nYour suggestion or ideas: If you have any changes to a particular scenario please share I'm open to suggestions. If you have a totally different idea or ideas please share aswell I'd love to hear.\n\nDecisions(really wanna try this): You've been dating this guy for about 4 months and things seem to be going great. You have a kid and its not until your son its 3 that your boyfriend decides to leave. After about 5 months you open up and i come in instantly helping out caring for both of you. I'm only there for about 2 months until your sons father comes back wanting to take over. (My idea with this is when your ex comes back you break up with me to give you some space to decide who you want. This is a rough idea on a dream i had this morning haha.)\n\n\nOpposites attract: You were always raised on the idea of needing college to get anywhere in life. You always believed that and no matter anyone said to you. You went to college and ended up landing a good job in Atlanta. You move into a nice neighborhood and that's when you meet me. A blue collar worker making just as much if not more than most other neighbors that didn't spend a day in college. \n\nPolice: You were always the do it by the books kind of cop. You're offered a new position in Chicago's intelligence division. When you get there you realize this isn't a typical unit. We do whatever we have to do solve a case even if it's against protocol.\n\nPolice part 2: This I'm open to other suggestions and maybe you could play a GM role. Otherwise we could both be partners. \n\nSmall town living: you were always a good respectable person. You always saw the good in people but sometimes that wasn't necessarily a good thing. You dated a guy that seemed fine to everyone except behind closed doors he was extremely abusive. When you came home one day with a broken nose and a black eye your parents knew they needed to do something. They decided to send you to live with your aunt to hopefully hide you from him.\u00a0 You were relieved to be away from hom finally. When you get to your aunt's farm you see me working out in the fields. \n\nSuperpower: Ever since i was 5 i knew i was different but no one ever told me why. I came from a long line of shapeshifters unfortunately that's usually what got them killed. Both my dad and uncle were shifters but they mysteriously died when i was 5. My mother started to see the signs of me becoming one the animal print started to show on my body and she knew she couldn't go through with it. When i was 6 she turned me over to foster care and disappeared. Now I'm 22 and using my gift for more personal gain. Rather it be changing into a horse betting on myself at the local track or a championship caliber race dog. You've been passed a file on me to try and bring me in to try and stop a criminal mastermind from trying the world into chaos. \n\nSpring break: You and your friends decide to go to Florida for spring break. You see a bunch of motorcycles speed by doing wheelies. After a few miles you see the motorcycles at a gas station and decide to stop.\n\nPokemon: I've saw this idea and I've been wanting to try. You play a trainer and i play the pokemon. We can discuss further details in PM.\n\nYoutuber house: You're the owner and CEO of an esports team. You've had a team house for a abour a year and are ready to expand. You decide to have a content house you do your research and invite me to join and be the first streamer\/content creator to live in the house with you. Eventually you'll invite others to join.\n\nZombie apocalypse: I'm open to a lot of different scenarios. Rather it's the walking dead where the zombies move kind of slow.

We're both sophomores in college and play football for the school. You and me always had a connection but never acted on it. Now it's your brother's wedding and we meet up when you see my smoking out by my truck.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Roleplaykik","subreddit_id":"t5_369bo","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Roleplaykik","subreddit_subscribers":39564,"subreddit_type":"restricted","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M4F] Decisions and other story based rp ideas.

I am just now realizing that I need to be taking my finances a bit more seriously, and am trying to find the best ways to do so. For a while I spent most my money on crap I don\u2019t need, and want to begin saving instead of spending.\n\nThis summer I plan on selling the various electronics and things I no longer use\/need. I also will continue working at my current job, but will have to stop once I go into college, as I will be too far away. (I do want to keep the job as they offer a decent $1000\/year scholarship that feels useful.) I want to save a majority of this money, but want to do so in a way that is more likely to make me money\/not be losing out on inflation (however you want to look out it). I am currently looking at the PNC bank high yield savings account. These savings would likely be my emergency fund, as these sorts of accounts are relatively liquid. (That actually leads me to one of my questions that their website doesn\u2019t answer: does this account have a withdrawal limit? If so, what is it?) I feel as if having my money in one of these accounts would discourage me from using it, but give me enough freedom to access it if needed. My question is, is there a better type of account I should be looking at? Is a savings account even worth it at this point, or should I keep my assets easy to access?\n\nTl;dr: 18yo looking to start a savings account, $700 in my current accounts, $300\/month spend (will be cutting down), and will be selling lots of stuff I don\u2019t use this summer.

I saw your smirk widen as you hit the light switch to reveal a sight that caused my mouth to go agape. In front of us was a large arena, ordained with typical sports aesthetic like stereos that blared music and fake crowd cheering, tv screens that recorded us and showed off our movements and even a digital scoreboard. What really surprised me though was the fighting pit which was covered in a mixture of soap and oils, with buckets of it being in the corner of the room as a reserve. I looked at you in shock as you just grinned at me. How the hell could you afford this and how have your parents not found this? You finally opened your mouth to speak.*\n\n\"This is my \"cure\", a soap and oil filled arena that we fight in naked, in loose clothing, or in leotards that I have on display for us. It doesn't matter though cause we're gonna be naked one way or another. The rules are simple....there are no rules and all dirty tricks you can think of are allowed. We fight for a few rounds and if we decide to wear clothes then an extra game happens where we fight to strip each other until one of us it naked. After all of this, the winner of each round gets a special prize, the chance to empty his balls of cum into the loser or do whatever they want. It'll be wet, sweaty and rough but you were the only person I could think of who would enjoy it.....\"\n\nHey there! This is an extract of an rp I've wanted to try for so long and so far it's been really hot with the guys who were interested. In case the extract didn't explain it enough already, I'll give a briefer version: We're two friends who, during a heatwave in our city, have to find a way to cool ourselves off. However, you claim to have a \"cure\" to our problem and lead us back to your house, where in your basement contains a sex fighting pit that is filled with oils and soap, where we fight, tease, fuck and whatever else to claim the title of winner! There's still fighting though but it's more wrestling with an extremely kinky twist \ud83d\ude0f.\n\nA little about myself, my name is Josh, I'm 20 years old and I'm a bi top. I'm looking to roleplay with a young bottom, preferably around the ages of 18-22 given that's my age preference. I'm also looking for a confident bottom since weak, timid and whimpering subs just turn me off since there's no equal footing in that lol.\n\nI'm totally limitless aside from a few obvious fetishes (Scat, piss, vomit, gore, rape, vore, slave + master kink, pedophilia, crossdressing, straight turned\/forced gay)\n\nMy kinks include (take note lol): i have a pretty big foot fetish, twinks, femboys (not too feminine though), sluts, threesomes, rough sex, cum stuffing, outdoors, oral, light bondage, ass play, flexibility or body contortion, excessive cum, teasing, details, flirting\/dirty talk, licking, biting, scratching, hair pulling, raceplay, oil play, using porn pics + links, wet sex, confidence, showers, descriptive, long srps and clothing. My MAIN KINKS would be the foot fetish, twinks, sluts, dirty talk and flexibility. It'd be worth noting that if you can play two or more guys in the roleplay thats awesome but its totally not required, just nice to have an extra hole \ud83d\ude09.\n\nI really hope you're interested, if so then message me on kik at TheosK1 and we can discuss the details. I prefer kik since Reddit's chat system is a little slow. When you message me please add your kinks, limits and a ref of your character. I'm a little sick of getting the \"Hey\" cause it's so repetitive and doesn't make me even remotely interested. I'm not asking for an essay, just a few things to let me know what kind of partner you'll be. \n\nI have a bunch of refs as well so if you're stuck looking for one then I can provide some for your to choose. I personally prefer real life pics (not of us by the way, unless you're a real twink \ud83d\ude09) but animated is fine.\n\nThanks!\n\nP.S. Text me your favorite colour so I know you actually read all of this \ud83d\ude1c.\n\n*I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+*\n\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Roleplaykik","subreddit_id":"t5_369bo","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Roleplaykik","subreddit_subscribers":39564,"subreddit_type":"restricted","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M4M] [Sex Fighting Arena!]","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Roleplaykik\/comments\/b7v2hd\/m4m_sex_fighting_arena\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

I also have been recently diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, and am autistic. I am currently seeing a psychiatric nurse periodically but do not have another appointment with him for a month. I am also on the waiting list to see the community mental health team but their waiting list is very long and they haven't yet contacted me.\n\nMy doctors have tried me on a lot of different medication but I'm currently on 40mg amitriptylene, 2.5mg olanzapine, 60mg duoxetine, omezaprole (because of the olanzapine) and loratadine for allergies. Until recently I was on 40mg fluoxetine instead of the duloxetine but my doctor swapped them because my chronic fatigue was so bad and she thought it might help with the nerve pain. I started on 30mg, and then after three weeks went up onto 60. At first I seemed fine, although a little up and down, except for a few episodes of....... weird shit.\n\nThe first one, I was coming home from university and saw a shadowy man walking towards me but when I blinked he disappeared. Second, I have random spells of dizziness when I'm sitting down, and feel that the room is spinning. My mood has also been a lot more hectic and chaotic, going up and down, and I have had a few intense episodes of being absolutely convinced that I'm going to die, with no real reason- looking back I know that i'm overreacting but in the moment I am sure that I'm dying. I have relapsed with my self harm and am really really really concerned about this shadowy figure because logically I know there was nothing there but I SAW HIM. I've had episodes like this before when I was younger, saw a psychiatrist but he laughed at me and told me I had an overactive imagination so I'm really interrogating myself over this.\n\nI am definitely going to see my doctor and get this sorted out- I will try tomorrow. I just need reassurance. Can anyone give me any suggestions on what might be causing this? Any idea on how my meds might be changed, or what I could ask the doctor to look into to sort this out?

We fight for a few rounds and if we decide to wear clothes then an extra game happens where we fight to strip each other until one of us it naked.

This is an extract of an rp I've wanted to try for so long and so far it's been really hot with the guys who were interested. In case the extract didn't explain it enough already, I'll give a briefer version: We're two friends who, during a heatwave in our city, have to find a way to cool ourselves off. However, you claim to have a \"cure\" to our problem and lead us back to your house, where in your basement contains a sex fighting pit that is filled with oils and soap, where we fight, tease, fuck and whatever else to claim the title of winner! There's still fighting though but it's more wrestling with an extremely kinky twist \ud83d\ude0f.\n\nA little about myself, my name is Josh, I'm 20 years old and I'm a bi top. I'm looking to roleplay with a young bottom, preferably around the ages of 18-22 given that's my age preference. I'm also looking for a confident bottom since weak, timid and whimpering subs just turn me off since there's no equal footing in that lol.\n\nI'm totally limitless aside from a few obvious fetishes (Scat, piss, vomit, gore, rape, vore, slave + master kink, pedophilia, crossdressing, straight turned\/forced gay)\n\nMy kinks include (take note lol): i have a pretty big foot fetish, twinks, femboys (not too feminine though), sluts, threesomes, rough sex, cum stuffing, outdoors, oral, light bondage, ass play, flexibility or body contortion, excessive cum, teasing, details, flirting\/dirty talk, licking, biting, scratching, hair pulling, raceplay, oil play, using porn pics + links, wet sex, confidence, showers, descriptive, long srps and clothing. My MAIN KINKS would be the foot fetish, twinks, sluts, dirty talk and flexibility. It'd be worth noting that if you can play two or more guys in the roleplay thats awesome but its totally not required, just nice to have an extra hole \ud83d\ude09.\n\nI really hope you're interested, if so then DM me  and we can discuss the details. I prefer kik since Reddit's chat system is a little slow. When you message me please add your kinks, limits and a ref of your character. I'm a little sick of getting the \"Hey\" cause it's so repetitive and doesn't make me even remotely interested. I'm not asking for an essay, just a few things to let me know what kind of partner you'll be. \n\nI have a bunch of refs as well so if you're stuck looking for one then I can provide some for your to choose. I personally prefer real life pics (not of us by the way, unless you're a real twink \ud83d\ude09) but animated is fine.\n\nThanks!\n\nP.S. Text me your favorite colour so I know you actually read all of this \ud83d\ude1c.\n\n*I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+*\n\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtykikpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2wtau","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dirtykikpals","subreddit_subscribers":183866,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"20[M4M] Sex Fighting Arena!","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtykikpals\/comments\/b7vply\/20m4m_sex_fighting_arena\/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}

We all split rent and utilities. More often than not I step up and help a little bit more to keep us where we're at or help someone else in the family with something like getting their car checked or making sure there's enough money in their checking accounts when they're in a pinch, even at my own expense in the long run. I haven't been able to buy a car in 2 years but I'm okay with it now for the most part because I'm a few months away from getting one now and public transport usually gets me everywhere I need to go in the meantime. My problem is that unless they need money from me, my family members treat me like straight shit or talk down to me alot. It's infuriating because the most I ever ask my mother\/sisters for is a ride to work once or twice or something simple like to borrow somebody's laptop and the response is \"why don't you buy a car\/laptop and stop spending money on stupid shit\". Anytime I ever bring up how much more generous I've been to them in the past it turns into a shouting match because nobody will listen or they say deflect from the core issue and scream \"YOU SPEND IT ON YOURSELF!\/WE PAID YOU BACK!\" Even worse is that they all feel that they can talk to me however they feel without me saying anything because they're \" mature adults\" (I'm 21 but they're all in their 30s or 40s).\n\nThe argument that I just throw all my money on trivial nonsense comes from me spending $40 at most every couple months on comic issues I collect and a couple hundred every summer to update my collection. I literally never have time to spend anything on myself aside from bills because of school\/work and the last time I made any extravagant spending was in December then 2 weeks ago on vacation so whenever this argument gets thrown at me I just distance myself from them for a while. When I had an argument last year with my mother, she kept yelling not to \"flare up\" at her (which was me defending myself after her and my sister kept talking over me and swearing at me for 10 minutes ) because I'm a \"child\". That was the first time I said to any of them that they never treat me like a real adult unless money's involved. After we got done shouting I didn't speak to anyone for several days, until my mother offered to take me to work then ask me to pay a little more rent than usual because she couldn't cover all of her share that month. Essentially I just got into the same argument again with my mother and when I went into detail about how much I strain myself to help out she decided she was tired of my presence and told me to leave her room.\n\nAny solutions that anyone can think of? I don't want to move out unless I really have to but I'm past sick of getting treated like a kid and getting yelled at whenever I remind them that they treat me like one until they need something from me.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DysfunctionalFamily","subreddit_id":"t5_2ypcx","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/DysfunctionalFamily","subreddit_subscribers":2143,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My family doesn't seem to know how to treat me right (Until they need money from me)","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DysfunctionalFamily\/comments\/b7vqvs\/my_family_doesnt_seem_to_know_how_to_treat_me\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I like talking about random shit and learning obscure factoids.\n\nGive me a shout if you fancy, not really fussed about age, younger or older, but can you please write a little more than \"hi\", tell me a wee bit about yourself like I did in my post just to give a jumping off point, I'd like that.\n\nThanks for reading. xx","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"r4r","subreddit_id":"t5_2rn0e","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/r4r","subreddit_subscribers":240691,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"37 [M4F] online.

If you're unfamiliar, CFNM stands for \"clothed women, nude man,\" and it's just how it sounds. It's often used in dom\/sub relationships, but that's not exactly what I'm looking for. I'm interested in a small-to-medium sized group of women who would like to be served by a naked man at a future get together. Think a small cocktail party where you are all dressed up a bit, and I'm your naked bartender, waiter, and anything else you require. I could even supply the wine\/alcohol (within reason). I'd be there to make and bring your drinks and serve you in any other way you want.\n\nThose services could be completely non-sexual. Maybe you want a man to be the one objectified and serving for once? Or as sexual as any of you want. I'm there to serve at your pleasure? Give a shoulder rub? I'd love to. Make myself hard on demand? You're the bosses. Masturbate in front of the group? Sure, why not. You can touch or grab me as much, or as little, as you'd like. And I'd happily perform any sexual act anyone wants.\n\nI can't exactly say why, but it's a huge fantasy. I know it's is a long shot, but who knows?\n\nAbout me: I'm 35, and while I don't have a model body, you'll find me in pretty good shape with a great ass, a muscular\/athletic build, and a thick, visually appealing cock.\n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sUtWmVR.jpg","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"NYr4r","subreddit_id":"t5_2tzr3","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/NYr4r","subreddit_subscribers":15220,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M4F] or [M4FF] #NYC - CFNM: Interesting twist on a night in with your girlfriends","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/NYr4r\/comments\/b7vs94\/m4f_or_m4ff_nyc_cfnm_interesting_twist_on_a_night\/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}
