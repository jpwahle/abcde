I'm sure it just comes from a fear of seeming like an ignorant newbie (which shouldn't be a fear since I truly am an ignorant newbie) and I also have a deep fear of disrespecting monks\/nuns and other teachers.\n\nI live in Northern California in an area rich with resources including two wonderful monasteries, one Mahayana (The City of Ten Thousand Buddhas) and one Theravada (Abhayagiri). I've visited before and always feel myself filled with fear that I'll act the wrong way, say the wrong thing or offend someone there. Probably because I did once and have never forgiven myself for it. I entered a hall and bowed with some nuns, which is sometimes allowed, but it was during a private female-only meditation and I was ejected and felt awful. Either way, even with that aside I feel out of place.\n\nAre these the places to seek teaching? Should I wait to seek teaching until I've delved more deeply and studied harder alone? Or should I just jump in, possibly offend some people or traditions, and hope they accept me and are willing to teach?\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nUPDATE: Had a doc\u2019s appointment today near the Abhayagiri Monastery and forced myself to go during a couple hours I had free. It was wonderful, and I\u2019ll be going back often, I\u2019m sure.

Split custody.  \n&amp;nbsp; \nWe we're together for 14 years, married for seven of them. I am 42 now. I was 22 when we first started living together. When we had been living together for about 6 months or so, he used to hit me on the bottom playfully. Then, the hitting on the bottom became hard and painful. I would ask him to stop. He didn't. I remember one particular time when he hit my bottom so hard that it was loud and really hurt. I finally showed I was angry, and told him he absolutely needed to stop. He agreed. He did slip up and do it again a couple other times after that, but ultimately that behavior stopped.  \n&amp;nbsp; \nThere was no other overt physical violence in the relationship, but he was much larger than I was. I was very thin and petite, and he was taller than me and very overweight. There were times he would lay on top of me and I couldn't breathe. I would ask him to get off of me, and he wouldn't right away, even though he did eventually. This happened intermittently during the relationship.  \n&amp;nbsp; \nOne other physical violation that I remember experiencing was when he would go down on me, and I would try to move his head to keep him from doing it, and he wouldn't. He would hold himself there and keep going down on me even though I was trying to stop him.  \n&amp;nbsp; \nThe emotional aspects of the relationship left me feeling that I could not be myself, and could not express my feelings, especially if I felt hurt (he was unable to truly apologize or seem to feel remorse).  He would deny saying things or my feelings, leaving me really confused and feeling helpless when we argued (note: me expressing a hurt feeling would lead to an argument). \n&amp;nbsp;\nHe disliked almost all of my friends, and complained about my family. I stopped having friends over.  \n&amp;nbsp; \nHe ridiculed music and shows I liked; I relished my time alone so I could enjoy those things without risking him being there to make snide comments.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nIn between all of this, we did have good times and I did feel grateful for ways in which he loved me.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nBut I recently broke up with someone, and for some reason it's gotten me thinking more about these aspects of my marriage, and whether or not I was physically or emotionally abused. I'm feeling very mixed up about all of it.\n&amp;nbsp;\nI have really close friends, and I haven't told them about the physical stuff. Appreciate any feedback.

I've always loved the idea of having my own business and being my own boss, creating my own work schedule, and being in charge of my own personal project to the world. I also feel that having a business is one of the most \"pure\" ways to generate wealth, seeing as how you have to work very hard for the rewards that you later reap. In other words, any income that you get is 100% earned and worked for.\n\nI would like to be a travel photographer in a few years when I can get out into the world and grow as a person and as a soul. This artistic profession would be my means to truly feeling free on an earthly level and I would be able to complement that with growing my soul on a spiritual level. \n\nI am making this post because I just had questions about the business I want to have for myself. Everyone must have some sort of income, for it simply necessary for survival. I feel while that a business of pure photography can help me with some money, it is not substantial enough and also not useful to the world (this is the biggest reason why I am uncertain about the direction I want to go in). I want my business to do something for the world. I want to give back. Although photos are beautiful, I feel that a pure photography business lacks a greater purpose, which is primarily what I want for my business. I want my business to be a representation of me, something to offer to the world. I thought of also selling clothing with spiritual quotes and artwork of spiritual leaders and symbols, but even these feel lacking.\n\nAny ideas on what I should do? Am I in the right mindset?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. Much love to you.

In all this time I have suffered in my own personal living hell. Horrific anxiety, hopelessness, failing at everything I cared about. Depression is likely situational and I honestly believe if my situation changes for the better then it would be gone. I no longer believe the things I want most in this life are possible anymore. More than anything, I want love but there are so very many things that keep me from having it.\n\nI probably have something along the lines of avoidant personality disorder or social anxiety disorder or a mix of both. It makes life very difficult to live. I will avoid social gatherings at all costs and even when I try and fight my fears and introduce myself to someone (anyone) new, even when we get along, I will feel a need to avoid them in the next time we see each other. This makes it impossible to form the relationships I want in life. In work I am pathetic not being able to do the people facing part of my job which is basically the whole damn job. IT in the beginning is very people facing and when I do have a job or internship in my case, I have no motivation in work either even though I did go every day despite injuries I had at the time. I have no motivation anymore to try in school either having to take multiple breaks because of mental issues. I'm almost done but I'm afraid I might fail.\n\nIf I could have the affection and love that I so desperately want and need, life would be livable and I could face every hardship with a smile. But I don't have that and the girl of my dreams will likely never want me back. Even if she did I'm in a bad situation at present and it remains to be seen if I'll ever get out. I live with my parents and I have no job as of yet but even if I got a job I'd do terribly at it and probably get fired because of my problems. A large part of me does not care anymore what happens to me and simply wants to give up on everything. I think a day will come when I cannot take it anymore and simply commit suicide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"offmychest","subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/offmychest","subreddit_subscribers":751501,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"In a dark place","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/offmychest\/comments\/9kc0n0\/in_a_dark_place\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

I went in person to city clerk to pay it and they also said they couldn't find it either. It was for improper turn signal (Illinois). I had a passenger with me who got a different ticket for possession of cannabis under 10grams first offense and it was considered an ordinance. His ticket was under his name and showed up right away to pay online. I did not have any thing on myself and have no prior record and was not charged with anything like that except the turn signal thing. How can I pay mine for improper turn signal if there's no record for it? I have the actual ticket and gave it to the city clerk and they were unable to look it up.\n\nTo add to this the cop accused me of smoking Marijuana (I wasn't I was smoking my vape pen with just nicotine) and then went on a rant about how why am I hanging out with \"boys like that\" and said to me what would my father think about this and said maybe I should call him. This strangely enough is not the first time I  have had a cop threatening to call my dad, one other time for a different reason one did and I was 23 then, and he did actually call my dad.I am  26yrs old  now, and don't know why this cop in a different town with me being almost 4 years older said that to me. I don't know if that's why the ticket is not filed. I think he had sympathy for me or something but I'm not sure. Maybe because of my job. Also they asked to search my car, and I allowed them because I knew I had nothing on me. They did and obviously found nothing and were much more concerned about my passanger than me. When the cop said he was issuing my ticket I was afraid it was for the same as my passenger he said no worries you will just get a moving violation and you are free to go. \n\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"legaladvice","subreddit_id":"t5_2rawz","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/legaladvice","subreddit_subscribers":621769,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Received a ticket but can't pay it","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/legaladvice\/comments\/9kc0yc\/received_a_ticket_but_cant_pay_it\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

looking hopefully this time is the charm!\n\nSo a bit about me, I'm 21, British (with the accent, that for reasons which escape me, is widely adored) living in the UK. Im a fairly experianced Master. Im a student full time so no job to take me away from training a devoted slave. I have also finished university for the summer so I'm all yours. Also somewhat of a night owl so timezone differences are not an issue to me.\n\nSo my kinks are as follows:\n\n- Humilation\n\n- Degredation\n\n- Pain (causing)\n\n- Body writing\n\n- Control (i.e. full power exchange being the end goal). \n\nThese are just my main ones and not an extensive list. If you don't see one you enjoy please tell me, as chances are im into it.\n\nI don't have any dislikes so what ever yours are I'd say are mine. I'm very respectful in this manner. I also like to work on a dislikes, soft limits, hard limits scales. This meaning, I'll never make you do hard limits, soft limits things you will do but that require a little more caution when doing, these are things your rather scared of but will try if the conditions are correct. Hard limits are things you'll never do under any circumstances. And dislikes are things you'll do but actively dislike or don't enjoy, these things are usually used for punishments.\n\nSo as for what my should ideally. No younger than 18 obviously. No older than 30 (I'm open to older but it doesn't usually work, but hey we don't know until we try). Ideally someone my age but not a deal breaker. All body types welcome. All countries are welcome as well as timezones. However special consideration may be made to slaves from the UK.\n\nThe type of slave im actively seeking should be dedicated to me and her training. She should be comfortable in the sending of pictures and videos, as im a very visual person. She should also he comfortable perfoming via Skype, and talking on the phone. The last two are end goals and not something I'd expect immediately. Also not a deal breaker but my dream slave would be comfortable sending and showing face pics. In short my dream slave is a type of exhibitionist (if this isn't you, don't feel like you can't contact me).\n\nI ask that all perspective slaves have, at the bare minimum, a kik account. If you do have one awesome, read on for the next steps. If you don't, please make one its not hard and won't take long. I also enjoy using whatsapp and am more than willing to use it but please use kik to initially contact me.\n\nSo if you've read all this and are liking what you've read then please either pm with the following:\n\n- Name\n\n- Age\n\n- Experiance (if any, none is fine as i love    training new slaves)\n\n- Toys (if any)\n\n- Favorite movie (so i know you've read the whole ad.\n\nOr alternatively you can fill in this google form i made!\nhttps:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSfQ1p96hWwUBnNOGAtfyskH7JVfKEvosVkG-Zwf7NYaqudKTw\/viewform\n\nEdit: sorry about the weird spacing it was the only way to aboivd bits getting all smushed up","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtykikpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2wtau","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dirtykikpals","subreddit_subscribers":134636,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"21 [M4F] British Master seeking a slave","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dirtykikpals\/comments\/9kc14d\/21_m4f_british_master_seeking_a_slave\/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","wls":3}

looking hopefully this time is the charm!\n\nSo a bit about me, I'm 21, British (with the accent, that for reasons which escape me, is widely adored) living in the UK. Im a fairly experianced Master. Im a student full time so no job to take me away from training a devoted slave. I have also finished university for the summer so I'm all yours. Also somewhat of a night owl so timezone differences are not an issue to me.\n\nSo my kinks are as follows:\n\n- Humilation\n\n- Degredation\n\n- Pain (causing)\n\n- Body writing\n\n- Control (i.e. full power exchange being the end goal). \n\nThese are just my main ones and not an extensive list. If you don't see one you enjoy please tell me, as chances are im into it.\n\nI don't have any dislikes so what ever yours are I'd say are mine. I'm very respectful in this manner. I also like to work on a dislikes, soft limits, hard limits scales. This meaning, I'll never make you do hard limits, soft limits things you will do but that require a little more caution when doing, these are things your rather scared of but will try if the conditions are correct. Hard limits are things you'll never do under any circumstances. And dislikes are things you'll do but actively dislike or don't enjoy, these things are usually used for punishments.\n\nSo as for what my should ideally. No younger than 18 obviously. No older than 30 (I'm open to older but it doesn't usually work, but hey we don't know until we try). Ideally someone my age but not a deal breaker. All body types welcome. All countries are welcome as well as timezones. However special consideration may be made to slaves from the UK.\n\nThe type of slave im actively seeking should be dedicated to me and her training. She should be comfortable in the sending of pictures and videos, as im a very visual person. She should also he comfortable perfoming via Skype, and talking on the phone. The last two are end goals and not something I'd expect immediately. Also not a deal breaker but my dream slave would be comfortable sending and showing face pics. In short my dream slave is a type of exhibitionist (if this isn't you, don't feel like you can't contact me).\n\nI ask that all perspective slaves have, at the bare minimum, a kik account. If you do have one awesome, read on for the next steps. If you don't, please make one its not hard and won't take long. I also enjoy using whatsapp and am more than willing to use it but please use kik to initially contact me.\n\nSo if you've read all this and are liking what you've read then please either pm with the following:\n\n- Name\n\n- Age\n\n- Experiance (if any, none is fine as i love    training new slaves)\n\n- Toys (if any)\n\n- Favorite movie (so i know you've read the whole ad.\n\nOr alternatively you can fill in this google form i made!\nhttps:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSfQ1p96hWwUBnNOGAtfyskH7JVfKEvosVkG-Zwf7NYaqudKTw\/viewform\n\nEdit: sorry about the weird spacing it was the only way to aboivd bits getting all smushed up","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"bdsmr4r","subreddit_id":"t5_2vd0v","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/bdsmr4r","subreddit_subscribers":1666,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"21 [M4f] British Master seeking a slave","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bdsmr4r\/comments\/9kc3y0\/21_m4f_british_master_seeking_a_slave\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I am having trouble deciding on a dog to love and train as an ESA (Emotional Support Animal). I'm really torn between a few breeds and what not.. So I thought I'd describe myself and what I'm looking for.. It's important to me that my future dog and I are compatible to the liking so we are both as happy as we can be. Anyway, enough of this. Moving on. (This might be a bit long, but bear with me, please.)\n\nSo to start, I will tell you a little about myself.\n\nI just turned 20. I am 5'2 (157cm) and rather small to say the least. Unfortunately, I suffer from depression, and GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), both chronic. Social shyness and constant fear of being vulnerable. Prone to stress. Also suffering from severe PTSD induced by an abusive home that I very recently got out of. I also have stress induced Tachycardia which doesn't go well with my anxiety. And to top it off, I have a fear of flying in planes. Traveling will be somewhat common in my life in the near future. My therapist did indeed prescribe me an ESA. This isn't something I just \"want\". \n\nI am originally from Texas, but now I live in a city in France, so the streets are never empty. I live with my boyfriend who helps take good care of me, so being outside is more tolerable than usual. We also go out almost everyday. But I never last very long. I ALWAYS end up having anxiety attacks. I also suffer from a bit of paranoia. Where I come from the gun laws always stressed me out. Guns. Were. Everywhere. I always live with the idea in my mind, \"Everyone thinks it won't be them.\" I hear about terrorist attacks and I know what people are capable of. So even here in this cute lil city, I tend to worry way more than I should. I am also not fluent in French. (Working on it). So it's hard for me to speak up even for the tiniest things like, hello and thank you. It's also very stressful to always hear voices from groups of people surrounding me and not having a clue what's going on. The confusion and stress is REAL. Having a happy little pup next to me would help my social shyness and fears for sure.\n\nI recently lost my dog just over a year ago. I might mention he was a pug. He was my best friend and saved me from myself everyday. When I say he was my shadow, believe it. He would NEVER leave me alone, and I LOVED it. Very playful, very cuddly, very loyal, very obedient (surprisingly as Pugs are not much for listeners). I am so broken and still dealing with his death and I am in need of cuddles and love. (My boyfriend gives plenty, but dog cuddles are better shhh).\n\nI have thought about just getting a pug but.. tonight I broke down over losing my best friend and came to the conclusion a pug wouldn't help. So mark those out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also might add I'm open minded, but I highly prefer bigger dogs. For the sake of feeling protected. My boyfriend and I both have experience with smaller and bigger dogs. We are capable of attending to the responsibilities that come with these cute furry creatures. Our apartment is quite big for just a couple of students. His mom is a very successful doctor so we're quite well off here. So we're going to be able to afford training courses and all the toys. :)\n\nI would also love a friendly dog. But I fear if he were too social of a dog, I'd restrict his needs because I really do not want people coming up to me, talking to me, asking for pets, what's his name?'s, and blah blah blah. Or my dog seeking conversation from others.. (because of my social shyness). But I think it wouldn't be too much of an issue because I will have a vest for him that clearly says DO NOT PET. Y'know.\n\nAnyway;\n\nI am looking for a dog who can:\n\n\\- sense when I am having a panic attack, in other words intelligent- can't live without cuddles and attention- loyal and brave- somewhat friendly to strangers but can provide protection if necessary\n\n\\- easy to train- patient\n\nI've researched quite a few different breeds and have come down to 3 that I'm torn between. Those being, the Golden Retriever, the Samoyed, and the German Shepherd. I fear the Golden Retriever would be too friendly with strangers, drawing unwanted attention. The Samoyed being too friendly as well? These aren't so much protection dogs, right? :( And lastly, the German Shepherd. Cuddly, loyal, and protective. These are originally my first choice, but I fear they won't provide as much compassion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, don't fear. Once I decide on a dog, I will do MUCH more research on them to be 101% sure we'll be the best of friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what do you guys think? Any other suggestions or ideas?Please message me or leave a comment!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks so much.  \u2764\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL,DRI am a socially anxious person and searching for the right emotional support dog.\n\n&amp;#x200B;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dogs","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhhk","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dogs","subreddit_subscribers":753484,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[HELP] Trying to find the right ESA dog breed for anxiety disorder.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dogs\/comments\/9kc3zh\/help_trying_to_find_the_right_esa_dog_breed_for\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

We are good friends, and still hook up. We have been planning to get a hotel in the city and go to a popular gay club. Earlier this week he tells me that he can get molly. I am 20 years old, still in college. He is 31 years old. I am definitely the bottom\/more submissive one in the relationship. We drive to get some molly at his friends place the Friday we plan to do all of this. \n\nSo we get the molly. About 60$ worth. I expected 2 pills for me. 3 for him. and 1 for his roommate, who asked him for some. Now we got our \"mollysworth\". However, it was not in pill form. It was crushed. He did not expect this. \n\nSo we improvise. We need to buy some capsules. I find some cinnamon capsules in a store. We empty them at his house. Clean them with a Qtip. Separate and crush the molly and place them in capsules. They were pretty large capsules too so I was worried about swallowing but it all works out. \n\nLater that day we get to the hotel. It is SICK. One of the nicest hotels I have stayed at. Amazing bathroom. California King Bed. And awesome mood light setting with a remote control that can control the lights to multiple colors. \n\nIn the lounge\/bar in the lobby, we pop the molly, and walk three blocks to the gay bar\/club. I expect it to start hitting in 30 minutes.We enter the place, meet some people in line outside and all dance together. \n\nNow let me start by saying this. I was absolutely taking a risk by taking molly for the first time somewhere with a lot of lights\/lasers. I knew this going in. It can be overwhelming. So when it started hitting, I went to a separate, more low-key bar and got water.\n\nThis place actually had 6 separate bars.\n1. EDM\/dance\n2. hip hop\n3. classic\/lowkey bar\n4. drag\n5. lesbian\n6. porn bar (we'll get to that in a minute)\n\nAfter doing all that, I started to feel less overwhelmed. And then I honestly felt amazing. Like my body was happiness, sunshine, butterflies. I couldn't keep my hands off Kay (thats what i am calling my ex).\n\nAnd he couldn't keep his off me. We would sit in different areas in the bar and just feel each other, not super sexual, and talk. We were happy as hell. Later that night we dance, have a few drinks, and have a blast it was seriously a night to remember. \n\nThat night, he tells me about the porn bar. \nNow I'm a little confused. Because I had thought i had seen all parts of this club before during PRIDE earlier this year. This was my second time here. Well in a certain alley past the dance floor is the bathroom. In the mens bathroom there is a door. And also another entrance with a security guard. In leads the Porn Bar.\n\nSo I HAD been here during pride. But I thought it was just the game room bar or something. But that must have been just for that weekend. Because tonight, it was all dudes in jockstraps. Its darker, theres older men just sitting on the sides. There is porn playing on screens. And there are booths in the corners where people are having sex and gathering. \n\nLet me clarify, I have Never been in a place like this before. All i see is ASS ASS DUDES ASS. I am a fish out of water. But totally comfortable.

people. So let me just start from the beginning. When I was around 14 I began feeling pain in my scrotum, and by the age of 17 I finally got the courage to see someone about it. Turns out it was a varicocele, which was kind of a relief because now I knew what was causing the pain but it sucked because it meant that I had to go through with surgery to get rid of it. I got the surgery done at 18 ( which I was super nervous about), but it started swelling right after the operation, and when I spoke to my urologist about it he said that it was normal and that it would be gone within 6 months. When I saw him again after 6 months (it was still there and still very swollen), he told me to get an ultrasound, and I did, and it turned out that now I had a hydrocele. I was super annoyed by this as I thought the surgery would be the last of this kind of problem. He said I either had to get surgery or just deal with it forever, which sucked because it was super annoying and occasionally painful, but he said it doesn't cause any functionality problems other than a slight discomfort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out it's actually making it really hard for me to have sex as it causes extreme pain during and afterwards, to the point where I actually can't \/ do not want to. The day to day discomfort is also pretty annoying as well. I'm 21 now and considering surgery to get rid of the hydrocele, has anyone experienced this situation or know of anyone that has and gone through with the surgery?? Was it worth it and is it now  less painful?? What are your recommendations?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a picture of the hydrocele [https:\/\/imgur.com\/gxm7Emh](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gxm7Emh)\n\n&amp;#x200B;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Urology","subreddit_id":"t5_2thwv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Urology","subreddit_subscribers":427,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"21 Year old Male, post varicocelectomy hydrocele","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Urology\/comments\/9kc4oc\/21_year_old_male_post_varicocelectomy_hydrocele\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

I gave him my number that same day (which is unheard of from me, as I'm normally an anxious mess), and we were talking non-stop for what seemed like three weeks. It was pretty awesome, we have a ton in common and I actually looked forward to seeing his texts. We tried meeting a few times but for various reasons it didn't work, then he went out of country for a week. At this point, we had been talking for a little over a month before we finally met up in person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe date went really well, as far as I was concerned. He's quite a bit shorter than me (I'm 5'10'' and he's 5'6''), but that doesn't bother me. I thought we vibed really well together, and I had a ton of fun. Before I left he expressed interest in meeting up again soon. He texted me to make sure I got home safely and all that cute stuff!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following days, our texts really weren't as in-depth as they used to be, but only on his part. I was still super interested and trying to keep the conversation going forward, but his responses were getting shorter and eventually gave me little to work with. He always used to text me first or snap me, but all of that stopped. I eventually stopped trying just to see if he would initiate any conversation, and he didn't. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, whatever. I'm not super upset or anything, and I went on a date with someone else during one of our periods of silence. But, what's weird is that he still likes every post I make on Facebook, almost every Instagram post, and occasionally will respond to my snap story. He does these things, so naturally I think he's still interested so I initiate a conversation, and I get nothing. Like one-lined responses. I don't care if he's not into me, I just wish he would be like any other normal guy and just ghost me (or tell me). At this point, should I just remove him from my social media? Or should I try to reach out (again) and figure out what he's thinking?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dating_advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2s4kl","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dating_advice","subreddit_subscribers":513714,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"do i just give up on him?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/9kc565\/do_i_just_give_up_on_him\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

My mother told me to get a running start into the busiest street I could find, that if I could stop existing that would be great. \n\nSo I come to reddit for...I don't know what. I just discovered this sub and before posting I looked at some of the recent posts or however it's filtering and god Damn y'all seem pathetic to me. But I know It's mental illness or boredom. \n\nI'm mentally ill I know it, I'm an asshole too but that's just how I've learned to survive this world in and out of my head. I want it to end I want to die I have a plan set and everything. But like one redditor said \"tell me how to make me do it\" I know that feeling oh so well. I'm smarter then this but I can't help it. I know what's wrong but I can't fix it and I don't know why. I want to die but I don't deserve it.\n\n I'm 29, I've lived enough live to experience enough to be 40 I swear. Before I was homeless i had cars I traveled places to stay people to love me. In my years I've seen how the world really works, it's terrible. But even homeless I don't have it that bad in comparison to god knows how many other humans on this earth. People Living literal shit, in war zones, children eating rocks just to feel something in their stomachs.\n\nI used to be happy but now I'm broken, I'm homeless, I'm an addict. Again I know what's wrong and how to fix it but sometimes the voices are louder then rational thought. I'm sitting on the side of a pizza joint using WiFi waiting for them to close to see what gets tossed to feed myself while a storm approaches, Fuck where did I go wrong? \n\nAnd I mean shit some of the feelings you guys are expressing I've had and I know but I've lived through and I don't know how to say this without sounding like an asshole...but you'll live through it too. Humans are amazingly resourceful creatures and can adapt to whatever. You feel like you are a burden on your parents because you may be but that's their fault and it's literally their burden to carry until you're 18 because of their choices the only thing you can do to help is grow up faster like get a job and contribute to the ease of that burden but if you go and kill yourself now you're going to be a burden on their mind and soul until they die. Run away before you try to kill yourself watch a whole city\/care about you. Use reddit as a tool to learn not memes and entertainment. Check out the homeless and vagabond subs. \n\nIt's starting to rain I've got to finish this up and take cover or I would go on and on I'm sure. I'm on mobile and I'm an idiot so I apologize for an ugly post.

I've ping-ponged.  I was 200 for a while after college, started eating healthy. Dropped to 170 and was doing well.. I really let myself go when I moved in with my partner, because we both struggle to eat for nutrition and not for emotional need. Before I knew it, it's three years later and I somehow weighed 250 lbs as a 5'2 female. And the more ashamed I became of myself, the easier it became to just eat as an escape. I worked in social work, often 12-14 hour days, and would just scarf down whatever fast food I could get my hands on in between home visits.\n\nIt's 2018 and I'm 30 now, and I feel like I'm \"too old\" to ever really get skinny and be pretty. But I know that it isn't true. I'm really sad I spent my 20s being morbidly obese, and even more sad that I look back at pictures of myself at 170 and comment on how skinny I was. I feel like people don't take me seriously because I'm fat. Or that people don't want to be my friend because I am fat. It's an awful, awful feeling that just feeds into the vicious cycle of eating for comfort.\n\nBut me and my boyfriend have recently decided that we have had enough and that we need to try for ourselves and each other. I'm happy to say that in August I weighed my most at 250 lbs, and today I weighed in at 229. I have a long, long road ahead of me. I have to lose another 100 lbs. That's almost half of me! It's crazy that I'm carrying this much around.\n\nI hope I can stay consistent. That has always been my problem. I have bad anxiety and depression and it feels crippling sometimes. I have been using my fitness pal and counting calories, and that has always helped. But it feels like so much work and I just hope I can keep up this rhythm. How can I keep consistent and remain encouraged? I'm tired of being so self-conscious of the space I take up when I sit on a bus or train or the movie theatre. I'm tired of feeling guilty for  ordering dessert at a restaurant. I'm tired of feeling like I have to make up what I lack in looks in my personality. And I'm scared that because I've failed so many times before, I'm going to fail this time. Any encouragement is appreciated.

There was chemistry there from the beginning last year but chose not too involve myself as I was still recovering from a broken heart from My first love of 6 years.  I am 25 now.  I decided to give it another go with him when I felt better and had grieved my ex. \n\n So 2 months ago we start hanging out and I just instantly am so happy to meet him again and spend time with him.  We hang out every week for a few days.  We have sex quite early on because there was such a build of chemistry etc... That it felt right.  After that I would go over and stay with him, Bond with his flatmates also.  The sex was great so much chemistry,  I felt completely comfortable around him,  he was starting to open up and be more vulnerable around me. \n\n He did tell me he loved his freedom and wasn't a relationship Kind of person.  I thought to give it time that it might be different with me.  He also Told me that he was not speaking to any other women so I felt comfortable enough at the time.  I was having fun,  this week I started wondering where this is going and where do we stand.  He was acting weirdly cold with me the past week not responding  a message I would send that he had seen,  Until a day and a half later with a one word response and the last message he didn't respond at all for days.  \n\nI was getting sick of it because in my mind I had feelings for him and felt this was going somewhere but I was now getting a different vibe,  and felt I was irritating him.  So I decided to text him asking to call me after walk?  He asked if it was serious I told him I just need to talk about some things. So I asked him to call me to which he put up every excuse how people are talking or he doesn't like talking on the phone etc...It was obvious the only way was through text.  So left with no other option.  I told him I am not interested in just causal sex And this not going anywhere it seems and that I need a little more than this. He told me how he can't get involved with anyone.  That it's better to stop this now before it gets worse.  He Says he likes me but not in the way I am thinking and that he never allows himself to get too close.  He said how he doesn't know if he is leaving the country and all this stuff and can't be moved by his feelings.  He said how he does feel something and thinks I'm worth it but he can't change that he is used to being the way he is and that he will regret it for the rest of his life.  \n\nHe then an hour later texts me saying he is feeling sad and bad.  I ask why and he says he I am too good to finish like that.  And tells me he is just thinking. I have to go do something for 10 minutes and said I'll be back. He then tells me he will sleep and talk to me tomorrow.  What on earth is going on with this guy?  I have never been so confused.

There was chemistry there from the beginning last year but chose not too involve myself as I was still recovering from a broken heart from My first love of 6 years.  I am 25 now.  I decided to give it another go with him when I felt better and had grieved my ex. \n\n So 2 months ago we start hanging out and I just instantly am so happy to meet him again and spend time with him.  We hang out every week for a few days.  We have sex quite early on because there was such a build of chemistry etc... That it felt right.  After that I would go over and stay with him, Bond with his flatmates also.  The sex was great so much chemistry,  I felt completely comfortable around him,  he was starting to open up and be more vulnerable around me. \n\n He did tell me he loved his freedom and wasn't a relationship Kind of person.  I thought to give it time that it might be different with me.  He also Told me that he was not speaking to any other women so I felt comfortable enough at the time.  I was having fun,  this week I started wondering where this is going and where do we stand.  He was acting weirdly cold with me the past week not responding  a message I would send that he had seen,  Until a day and a half later with a one word response and the last message he didn't respond at all for days.  \n\nI was getting sick of it because in my mind I had feelings for him and felt this was going somewhere but I was now getting a different vibe,  and felt I was irritating him.  So I decided to text him asking to call me after walk?  He asked if it was serious I told him I just need to talk about some things. So I asked him to call me to which he put up every excuse how people are talking or he doesn't like talking on the phone etc...It was obvious the only way was through text.  So left with no other option.  I told him I am not interested in just causal sex And this not going anywhere it seems and that I need a little more than this. He told me how he can't get involved with anyone.  That it's better to stop this now before it gets worse.  He Says he likes me but not in the way I am thinking and that he never allows himself to get too close.  He said how he doesn't know if he is leaving the country and all this stuff and can't be moved by his feelings.  He said how he does feel something and thinks I'm worth it but he can't change that he is used to being the way he is and that he will regret it for the rest of his life.  \n\nHe then an hour later texts me saying he is feeling sad and bad.  I ask why and he says he I am too good to finish like that.  And tells me he is just thinking. I have to go do something for 10 minutes and said I'll be back. He then tells me he will sleep and talk to me tomorrow.  What on earth is going on with this guy?  I have never been so confused. My gut tells me he really likes me but is scared.

I'm posting the same thing again to see what lovely lovely people are here tonight. School started again and I'm in my room trying to distract myself from work. I\u2019m looking people to chat with, male or female, no real preference as long as you're lovely. I'm genuinely looking for a nice chat with someone, we can discuss anything I'd think, from what's currently bothering you to that fantasy you really wanna talk about (but, you know, I'd prefer a nice introduction before getting all sexual up in my face). Regarding myself, I'm Aimi, 20. I'm 5'5'', black hair, athletic. I'm a volleyball player and a dancer, and well, my title says enough as is I think. Moved to the US when I was younger. I'm into the more general and gentle stuff most of the time but I reserve time for harder things like raceplay when the mood is right (my RP prompt on my profile should make that plenty clear). In terms of \u201coff the table\u201d stuff, extreme stuff, bathroom stuff, the general that we see on here. To be honest, I'm just not in the mood of RP tonight, chatting is preferred, so those preferences will mostly apply to what we eventually discuss more so than any RP. But yeah, come one come all, I'm friendly, I promise! Let me know a little bit about yourself, why you messaged me and let's see where it goes. And yes, \"you seemed approachable and I'm turned on\" is a valid reason, I guess, but it would at least help if you had certain preferences (points to my title). Looking forward to talking to all of you lovely people!\nA lot of people have taken to sending me pictures and asking if I look anything like that. While a lot are ridiculous, I'll give bonus points to any who try to do this.

Do you think that this will be enough money to buy the game and the standard for the required amount of additional packs (we all know that the base game will not be enough) ?  \n\n\nKeep in mind that I have to buy presents for others, as well as save for a trip to Germany next year (and I should be saving for a future car but... gabeN's money sack is too strong).  \n\n\nIf you need me to provide any more info, just ask.  \n\n\nThanks for any help!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Artifact","subreddit_id":"t5_31338","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Artifact","subreddit_subscribers":37366,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Will Artifact be too expensive for me?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Artifact\/comments\/9kcb93\/will_artifact_be_too_expensive_for_me\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I don't want to talk to anyone, I want to eat nonstop, and sleep fall\/winter away)\n* Nicotine cravings are killer (former ex-smoker and now ex-vaper ..nicotine cravings are universal...)\n* I've mostly broken my phone addiction, but this girl I had higher hopes clouded my thoughts a little.\n* I have no idea what I like outside of video games, and other things that mostly waste time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know that I love art, music, certain crafts, and that I'm extremely imaginative and creative when I want to be. The problem is that I've set my focus on the wrong things for 7+ years. I'm getting my GED - I actually scored above college level on some evaluations and have passed all 4 with flying colors. All I have to do is drive out and take the tests. What I do after is what has my head upside-down, though. My living environment isn't great, my peers don't have goals, you name it. I'm starting over fresh almost entirely on my own. The problem is, I haven't the faintest idea who this new me wants to be.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ADHD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnwb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ADHD","subreddit_subscribers":319147,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"What are some methods I can use to ease into sobriety with a little more grace?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ADHD\/comments\/9kceuo\/what_are_some_methods_i_can_use_to_ease_into\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

NYS considers anything 3 points and over to be a \"serious offense\" and will suspend your license for 60 days if on a junior license. Even 1mph over the limit is 3 points on your license so technically speaking any ticket any kid gets on a junior license for speeding should get it revoked although I have never heard of anyone i know getting revoked for speeding tickets on a junior license, even some a bit worse than 17 over. What is my best bet as far as handling it in court? I understand it was a bad choice so no need to tell me that, but I'd prefer to keep my license if possible and hopefully pay minimum fines and surcharge.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"legaladvice","subreddit_id":"t5_2rawz","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/legaladvice","subreddit_subscribers":621770,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Speeding Ticket","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/legaladvice\/comments\/9kcfy8\/speeding_ticket\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I am a single, openminded, outgoing person searching high and low for my baby girl. I am an ABDL myself which some girls are not ok with, just to get that out in the open right off the bat. I am not necessarily looking for a girl who is ABDL\/Mommy switch but if I meet someone open to that, great!\n\nAs far as my daddy side, I am a very loving, caring daddy who will discipline when there is a need for it. I love to make my baby feel like the little one she is on the inside. I love cuddles, bath time, bottle feeding, and diaper changes just to name a few. I also like to help my baby girl grow and excel in her adult and little sides of life... Offering advice, mentoring, encouraging, etc...\n\nI am hoping to find my baby girl, girlfriend, and best friend all in one person. I am not Poly btw. I know a relationship takes time to form and grow and I am not willing to just settle. I want to meet someone and form a relationship over time to make sure we are a good fit, get along, etc... I prefer a girl no older than mid to late 30s, nice smile, enjoys going out and being active... Location isn't a big issue but the closer to Dallas you are the better! :)\n\nAside from ABDL and kink I love music, traveling, animals, roller skating, minimalism\/simple living, being outdoors, and having fun...\n\nIf you are still reading and feel we might get along feel free to message me and lets chat a bit. I am happy to Skype, Text, talking on phone, etc... once we talk a bit and get to know each other.\n\nHave a great evening!  \nMatt\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS. Pics on Fetlife...
