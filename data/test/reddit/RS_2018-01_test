It's cold as hell outside and I'm not really in the mood to leave, so it looks like I'm gonna stay in tonight. I'm on the east coast US. I'm 6', kind of skinny, white, with a couple of tattoos and shoulder length hair. I'm not an especially social person and that makes it hard to meet women, I'm not really comfortable dating in the workplace and I don't feel comfortable approaching strangers in public, so even though I'm a bit of a flirt I don't make many connections. Recently I've been thinking that doing something long distance might not be so bad. It'd be nice to have someone to text and flirt candidly with, maybe it's just fun for a while or maybe it's something long term, I'm open to either. \n\nSo about me: I'm an animal person, I have several aquariums and 3 cats. I'm generally pretty chill and am more of a listener, but if you can get me talking about something that interests me I can become pretty animated. I can get antsy if I'm not focusing on something or doing something. I'm a massage therapist so I'm tactile/kinesthetic and like to twiddle with things. I'm a pretty avid scifi fan and listened to over 600 hours of science fiction audiobooks this year. Some of my favorite shows are Bojack Horseman, Black Mirror, WestWorld, Rick and Morty, Shameless (just hit season 2!), Bob's Burgers, and MST3K. I love Studio Ghibli, Pixar and Disney films. I also just saw Shape of the Water and that was great. And Star Wars, which was pretty good, but flawed. I'm a PC gamer. For multiplayer it's mostly just Overwatch, though I have an assortment of co-op and indie games I'll play with friends on occasion. For single-player I like action RPGs, indy games, and strategy games. When Monster Hunter World comes out on PC I'll probably disappear for months. I also have a Vive and enjoy VR. I'm a bit of a hippy and go to at least one burn or or camp out festival a summer and let loose. 420 friendly, but I don't smoke often. That's not everything, but hopefully there's something there you can connect with. \n \nI'm looking for someone between 20-35 (or close to that), average to slim build, of any height and race. I'd like to exchange photos/video off the bat to establish there's a mutual physical attraction and so I can be sure that you are not actually a 37 year old man. So PM me and we can exchange contact info.

I love it and find it very rewarding. My interests and hobbies are gaming, motorcycling, comics, PC building, and cars. So in the summer I live at car shows and for riding my bike. I have two bikes I ride a 2006 Harley Sportster and 2017 Indian Scout. I have my own custom PC and I love tinkering and making tiny upgrades. Gaming: I have loads of systems and play all kinds of things and normally multitask. I enjoy (J)RPGs, Sports games (I love being a GM and managing the money and picking players), Racing, and anything really story based. Comics: My main comics are Batman and Star Wars. I also get Harley Quinn (who I love), Walking Dead, and Spider-Man. I pick up Iron Man and Cap from time to time. TV: I love The Wire, Game of Thrones (read the books too), Halt and Catch Fire, Breaking Bad, Flash and Arrow, and South Park. I love Seinfeld and for Curb your enthusiasm. Music: Ok this is a bit of a mess, but my all time favorite is Frank Sinatra, but band is Avenged Sevenfold. I am really big into punk with my prefered style being stuff like Bad Religion, Anti-Flag, Sex Pistols, and Dead Kennedys. I enjoy trash metal so Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer. I love my classic rock too. I can talk about different bands all day. Other stuff: I really enjoy history and have watched so many documentaries. I mainly love Rome, WW2, Sengoku, and the Cold War. I listen to a lot of podcasts. I am a fan of the Yankees, New York Rangers, New York Giants, and Mercedes Petronas (F1), and if I must pick a team for basketball it would be the Knicks. I am trying to learn to like soccer a bit also, but it is slow going and I picked Manchester City in FIFA for a GM mode thing so I kind of like them I guess. I follow the news and politics, but prefer not to talk about for obvious reasons. I am interested in someday learning how to read and understand spoken Japanese and maybe just maybe speak it.

I can't move out, I live in one of the most expensive places in the US to live and I'm currently unemployed and I have no bachelors degrees or friends I could room with. \n\nI feel like I've wasted my whole 20s. I've dealt with depression and anxiety since at least my preteens and have very little memory of my childhood. My mental health has really impacted by 20s. I feel like in the last 9 years, it's really declined. I try to fight it, but my social anxiety has stopped me from continuing my education and for a long time prevented me from working a legit job.\n\nMy mother is a single parent, my father was in and out of the picture my whole life and is currently out. I don't think I ever really questioned by mothers behavior or took it for more than anything but face value until the last few years. She's always been very critical of me and the things I do. I've only had one boyfriend partially because I really don't want to have to tell her I have one. The one I had, she did not like and was not supportive at all of our relationship, even though I was an adult. \n\nShe always has to talk about herself or make things about herself. With me or other people. I will be talking about something and then she brings herself or her feelings into the conversation when I'm trying to tell her about how I feel or something that happened with me. \n\nShe likes to play the victim. Nothing is ever her fault. If she messes up, it's because of what I or some other outside force did. If she is wrong, she won't apologize. For example, she thought she had bought something from the grocery store and I told her she didn't, but I still looked in the fridge for it. She didn't believe me and tore the whole fridge up, screaming and swearing at me. She never found it and in the end it was my fault for her forgetting to buy it.\n\nNot only is she critical of me, she is critical of others. She makes comments and judgments on everyone and everything. At home she wants to put on a perfect show. When guests are over everything has to be spotless. She won't go a day without doing her makeup and hair, even if she doesn't plan on leaving the house. \n\nI try hard to not speak back. I may raise my voice and say things that I know will just incite her, but I never name call her like she does me. I've been called every name in the book. During the fights, she'll tell me i'm pathetic, I'm lazy, I'm a bitch, selfish, a horrible daughter, etc. I get little/no say in anything in the house due to the fact that it's not my house. I'm fortunate enough that she doesn't make me pay rent, but I feel like I should be once I get a job, so maybe then I could get a say in something (like maybe the heat doesn't have to be up to 70 every day of winter).\n\nI always thought of these are just little quirks or things about her, but as I've grown older, I started seeing that it's not really normal behavior. Reading this sub has helped me see that and brought me comfort. It's sad that there's so many parents out there like that, but it helps to know I'm not alone.\n\nSorry, this is really a rambling post. I don't talk about my home life like this ever and it's nice to get it off my chest. I'm going into 2018 hoping to get a job in January so I can be around less and gain more independence and realize that while I can't change her, I can change my reaction to her.\n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"tired of living like this","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7nc75f/tired_of_living_like_this/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

I'm Jake and I'm 19 years old in case you're wondering. I'll get to the point, I'm looking for a female srp partner, preferably long term. I'm into really detailed and long srps with build up and grammatical correct sentences and all that (but I'm not a grammar nazi so don't worry haha), while at the same time having a ton of smut and sex as well, you'd essentially get the best of both if you're an experienced roleplayer. I've been doing roleplay for a while now so I know a lot about being creative and descriptive so I'd appreciate the same in return.\n\nI'm totally limitless aside from a few obvious ones (i.e. Scat, Piss, Vomit, Gore, Vore, Extreme Age gaps like paedophilia and rape/forced), other than that go nuts with your own kinks. I've got plenty as well but you'll just have to message me to find out. \ud83d\ude09 \n\nLike it says in the top I've got a ton of scenarios that would be fun to play out but obviously if you've got your own I'd love to hear them, I'd leave them here but the post might get taken down and theres a lot of them too haha. I'm also open to feedback on other srps we would do so don't be afraid to tell me if I'm doing something you don't like, I'd prefer we both enjoy the experience than just one of us \ud83d\ude0a\n\nIf you're by some chance interested, then please DM me on this, comment at me down below or you can simply message me on kik at JJB.101, I usually reply very quickly though kik loves to screw people by not notifying them immediately when you've gotten a message (Its a pain in the ass basically lol) but if I see it I'll reply back, I won't ignore it even if I'm not interested (serious dick move). Also please don't just message \"hey\" or \"hi\" (i won't ignore it but its a turn off), add a bit of depth like your kinks, limits or even a \"I saw your reddit post and I like it because....\" so please keep that in mind.\n\nIMPORTANT: I can't stress this enough, if you're interested in a long term srp and you decide to leave because you're busy just tell me and we'll put it on hold, its totally frustrating when someone leaves and you're left guessing which just ruins the momentum. The same applies to me obviously and if I do it myself just tell me and call me an idiot lol. \n\nThanks for getting all the way down to this part, hope it wasn't too much to get through, I just really wanna srp with someone because I'm free currently from school due to the holidays and my schedule is empty right now so it'd be nice to relax one way or another \ud83d\ude09. Like I said my kik is JJB.101, don't be shy since it'll just be the two of us, plus I don't judge so say what you want to me.\nThanks! \u2764","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Roleplaykik","subreddit_id":"t5_369bo","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"(M4F) (SRP/ No Limits/ Long Term/ Please Read Description!)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/7nc7rz/m4f_srp_no_limits_long_term_please_read/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw"}

I've been lurking for some time and figured I need to vent here with others who may understand, so I have it somewhere so I can talk to my counselor at school about this too. Please let me know if I should take this down or if it violates a rule, I read them, but maybe I missed something. \n\n\nMy mom is very kind. She'll give you the shirt off of her back. She's a great person. She's more like a girl friend now that I'm 21. Thats what i call the real her. But she has this other side that comes out, that makes me walk on eggshells around her, that is her \"temper tantrum\" side.\n\n I've grown up seeing this side more often as she raised me as a single parent until I was 8. When I was little I stayed in my room all day, and never talked. Ever. If i did something wrong mom would spank me, but she also would grab my face and jerk me around and make me look her  in the eye while she yelled and spit in my face. One time she hit me so hard she left welts on my body and laughed it off with family as she told them. Or she would leave hand prints. She doesn't know her strength, that's what I say. I'm sure she never meant to hit me that hard as a kid so I'm not sure that's \"real abuse\" or just a mom spanking her kid too hard. If i have kids I'm not doing it because it doesn't seem right.\n\nLast year I made a post on Facebook, and the next day I wake up to a lot of missed calls from family, and they're convinced I have depression and I'm suicidal. I didn't ever consider it, but went to a counselor and took tests and was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and a skin picking disorder. My grandma took me to a psychiatrist and gave me meds, one was Xanax. I come home and my parents lose their minds.\n\nMom is a screaming fit for days, convinced I've told the entire family she's a horrible person, convinced I turned her own mother against her, and me going on meds is an excuse to pop pills (something she did in her youth), dad doesn't like me having the Xanax in the house (same for him ). Both yell at me for days and days, I make frantic calls to my grandmother and she talks to them and says if they continue she will come get me. \n\nThe worst is when I'm in my room, my space, I never lock the door to anything because mom doesn't allow it, she always busted into my bathroom while I'm showering, or my room. So dad STORMS in. Red with anger,spitting mad, I jump on my desk and I'm terrified. He says something about how \" I had it harder than you! I ate cans of beans over a fire! I know hardship! You have it so good, you can't be depressed! You're just lying to get drugs!\" I scratch my face apart, a coping mechanism I've had since i was a kid, mom yells at him to to stop cornering me because \"that's why she thinks we're abusive\", and that is the day I lost trust in my parents and suspected they have either a personality disorder or just some deep rooted issues. \n\nA year later and I'm still on medication, my grandma has passed away, and my dad and i are really close. Mom still has her tantrums. I'm moving out this summer, if only for a few months. So things are better but... I'm still nervous to lock my door, I'm scared to talk to them about serious things  (mom is impossible to talk to because she plays the victim and dad is just sort of enabling her). \n\nOh and she does this thing where she'll say something never happened. Like, this summer I was going from house to house because she was being hard to deal with. I'm staying at my boyfriend's and my aunt from thousands of miles away is in town. (Mom lives across the state ). I say I'm going to visit them for a night to my grandma over the phone. Ok. Grandma tells mom. I get a call from mom that went like this: \n\nundiagnosed mom: \n\"Hey, honey, are you coming home tomorrow?\" \n\nMe: \"No, didn't grandma say I'm visiting family? She said she would call.\" \n\nmom: \"NO, she didn't! I know you're lying! You TOLD me tomorrow and I know you're just trying to stay out of the house longer!\" She screamed and screamed and hung up, I started bawling and my boyfriend was stunned. He doesn't trust her a whole lot, in fact when he was visiting for Christmas we got out of the house alone for a few hours and he said \"Its like a mind game at your house. I can't tell if your mom is being serious or joking. If she's joking and you take it serious, she loses her mind. I can't read her face or anything. You're always in the wrong.\" \n\n\n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbyborderlines","subreddit_id":"t5_33d8b","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"New here.

She is super traditional but also really open minded. When younger, I was flirty and kept trying to pursue her but she would reject me all the time (i'm of a diff religion and her parents threatened to kill her if she even dated in college). All in all, we remained friends. There was a time gap in our friendship when her parents died. Then we rekindled our friendship via fb. Eventually I moved away and she and I tried an LDR when we realized how much we missed each other, but it never worked for longer than a month and we agreed to be platonic. We never even kissed so it was fine. \n\nI move back to my original city for work with my new gf from Florida two years later and I decide to meet my friend. At this point my gf is (29) and now I'm 30. My female friend is 28. Dinner was set for my friend and I alone to catch up. But then my gf tagged along. My gf says my female friend should not mind that she invited herself and really she is there to break down the \"mystery\" behind the woman so I can see she was never my soulmate. She was going to use her degree in psych to screen her, I had no idea what that meant but I didn't want to be late to meeting my female friend.\n\nWe all meet at this Italian place and my friend comes in and hugs me and my gf gives me a snide look. But then my friend, always oblivious, says \"nice to meet you,\" to my gf and hugs her as well and takes a seat across from us. My friend is pleasant through the whole dinner, asking questions about us, how long we've been dating and how happy she is that I am happy. She was making \"The office\" jokes and we were talking about movies. Normal friend crap.\n\nMy gf is sullen throughout this. She then changes the topic to makeup and looks at my friend. My gf, who is wearing layers of makeup ( I know her routine lol) says she hates it when woman wear too much makeup and wants to know my friend's makeup routine. My friend says she only wears three products so doesn't know much about it. This was the start of a weird dinner. My friend then gets grilled on her hobbies; my gf asks her why she does boxing-- is it to impress guys. Friend says she wants to be healthy. Gf asked her about her food choices and if she has ever dieted to stay so thin. My friend has never been on a diet. My friend still doesn't seem to notice the weird questions being thrown her way and answers them saying she's an open book. Since my friend is an open book, my gf escalates her questions.\n\nMy gf asks her how much debt she has ( friend has none, makes good money, but I can finally see my friend's discomfort at being asked this.) My gf, says she thinks people in Pysch. /academia should make a lot of money and it wasn't fair that people like my friend who just did business/computer science make so much money when people like us have student loans to pay off and are the ones who make real differences. My friend disagreed but didn't/couldn't go into why because my gf was on to the next question.\n\nThe worst part was when my gf asked my friend about her sex life and then goes on to say how ours is great. My friend looked perplexed but then said she only has had one partner and it was late, at 27. She doesn't really like to talk about sex. My gf essentially shamed her for her low number and why she was so traditional for a city girl. (My gf and I have high partner counts prior to each other). Countless times, I tried to steer the conversation in different directions. But it was like my gf was relentless. My gf went to the bathroom while the check came &amp; passed it my friend, and says \"you should pay since you make the most as we're trying to pay off student loans.\"\n\nI take out my card to pay for the whole dinner (I'm not a jackass, I would never let my friend pay), but my female friend takes the check throws down cash and chuckles, \"I haven't seen you in ages, don't worry about it.\" I apologize for my gf's behavior, but then my friend frowns, and tells me to smooth things over with her so she is so secure. We take the time to catch up in those five minutes. I do ask my friend, why is her partner count so low, she's smart, beautiful, nice it actually doesn't make sense. She said at 27 we started the LDR, she was sure she was waiting on me, that it could only be me. She did not mind the wait but then I broke her heart (I was immature and broke it off thru ghosting her; distance was too much at the time.) She said being broken hearted was fine, and of course we were in different cities so she moved on, but now she doesn't get why at 28 when we meet even in the capacity of friends, why is it only to be as my gf's target practice.\n\nShe asked me what she did that was so wrong and I was stunned. She said it simply. She gave the check to the waitress, put on her coat and left.\nThe way she said that makes me think she is disappointed in me and I can't take it. It also makes me think she feels I don't value her when that's not the case.\nAlso, side note about my friend: from observing her and even in college, I realize she is really good with boundaries. Like she does not flirt or anything if she knows someone is in a relationship/married. Tech, my gf should have felt at ease. Instead this was a disaster.\n\nI went home with my gf and I told her we need to talk about her behavior at dinner but she feels like she did nothing wrong. She wanted to fool around and was laughing at how my friend actually paid the bill and how she was a doormat. I was appalled as I've never seen her so mean before and wasn't in the mood for sex so instead told her I was tired. I went into the bathroom for a moment alone and I don't know why but I thought of my friend and started sobbing for ten minutes straight.\n\n\nIt's been 7 days and I don't want to touch my gf and she doesn't believe she's wrong so won't apologize so I'm staying at my mom's. All I can think of is my friend and why I treat her so badly.\n\n\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Met up with friend after moving back to home city. Gf comes to dinner only to ask rude/inappropriate questions ranging from my friend's hobbies to sex life, and tries to stick friend with bill. Gf won't apologize. Friend does not understand why she is always treated poorly by me.

Should I throw this idea away and just try to make the best of a career in business?\n\nAlso, bonus question for anyone who might know of the subject, but not specifically related to finance, do you know how going back to school for a second degree would work for a resident who's not a US citizen?\n\nThank you so much!","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"personalfinance","subreddit_id":"t5_2qstm","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"How viable is going back to college for a second degree in Computer Science?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7nckrn/how_viable_is_going_back_to_college_for_a_second/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

One of the options that I have been looking into is CSUCI, and I happen to have a few questions regarding this university. \n\n1)     What kind of housing is available for older students? I am 26 years old, and while I do not oppose the student lifestyle, I already had my \"college experience\" in my current city (where I am finishing up my transfer degree). Also, if you ask me, it would be creepy for an university to pair a 26 year old dude with 19 year olds. Are there apartment-style dormitories? or apartment complexes where students live at? (I'd rather not live where the families or older people live) \n\n2)      How expensive is it to live there? The city where I currently live at is kind of pricey yet, I find that the estimates given by the college's website are pretty out-of-touch with the reality of most of the students that I know. During my most expensive year, I paid 8000 in rent and services in one year as opposed to the 16,000 estimate in my school's website. I currently live with roommates and I pay 400 altogether (monthly) in a city where studios start at 800+utilities. \n\n3)     How about a part-time job? Who is the biggest employer around there? Are they the kind of jobs with opportunities? or dead-end, minimum wage jobs for students? Does the school hire students as workers? How is the local employer culture? do they work with you if you are a student, or do they have insane demands like \"we need you only 9 hours every week, but you need to have full time availability in case that we need you to work 50 hours, also, we pay minimum with no benefits, and you will work nightshift on weekends and festive days\". Also, what kind of opportunities are there during the summer? I usually work in the fields during the summer, anything like that over there?\n\n4)     Nightlife!? Again, my main reason to move there would not be the nightlife, but... how is it? is it only one scene? is it sketchy? are people outgoing? Where I live it is very hard for people who come out of state to make friends right away: It is a very reclusive and dry culture. It is torture around here to be outgoing or talkative.  \n\n5)     Outdoor activities. I enjoy hiking, surfing (yes, you can surf in WA state), swimming, shooting, etc. While it is not expected for the whole student body to fit any molds, would you say that people at CSUCI are outdoorsy? I love my roommates, but they are all couch potatoes, and so is the rest of the PNW. Everyone around here takes pictures of the one hike they went on, but most students stay inside and drink or get high (which I don't).  \n\n6)     Professional development. For those looking to go into the field of Law Enforcement, does the University or surrounding Community Colleges offer programs to self-sponsor and gain P.O.S.T. certification? I am aware that a few colleges do this in California, but I am not aware of anything like it at CSUCI. \n\n7)     Latino/Mexican-American presence. I am Chicano and the Seattle area has been nothing but great to me. Yet, it would be nice to have friends that understand what it feels like, when El Muchacho Alegre starts playing on my truck's speakers as we drive, haha. \n\n     Thank you all for reading this. Don't feel obligated to answer all of the questions. Also, HAPPY NEW YEAAAAAR!","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"csuci","subreddit_id":"t5_2skiy","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Questions from an out-of-state transfer.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/csuci/comments/7ncmwa/questions_from_an_outofstate_transfer/","whitelist_status":null}

Today I started driving on the road for the first time, and I fucking hate it. I completely suck at it. Too much shit I have to pay attention to. I'm a fucking idiot, so I can't multitask to save my life. So you gotta stay in your lane and make sure the car doesn't drift, watch out for road signs and shit, and also be paying attention to traffic? Yeah, no. It's just not gonna happen, I'm too stupid.\n\nDriving isn't the only thing I'm a failure at. School, work, money management. Basically any \"real world\" stuff that requires even the smallest bit of effort, I fuck it up. I suck at anything that has to do with the real world except socializing, and even with that I'm just average and plain at. Even the one real world skill that I enjoy, writing, I'm just plain at. Hell, even outside of the real world, I suck at everything. I suck at video games, and I always drop shows, even the ones I like. HELL, even the one thing I pride myself in, having a shit ton of useless knowledge, is fucked because there's just a ton of holes in the information I have stored.\n\nFuck, I just want to give up. Everything I do ends in failure. I was looking back on this time last year, compared to now. Everything was good, I had an amazing girlfriend, I had passed all my classes, I had a great job, and I had \"defeated\" the person I dislike most in life. Now? No girlfriend because I fucked up our relationship, no highschool diploma because I dropped out, I just left my second job, and the person I dislike the most in life now is me. What's even the point of this? I should just kill myself. I'm seriously tired of all this shit, it's all for nothing, seriously. People are always bitching at me for lounging around all day, and never trying to \"move forward\", but why would I? I'll just fuck it up in the end like an idiot anyways. It's never gonna improve. The only reason I'm still here is because a couple people need me to be strong for them, just a little while longer, but I can't even pretend to do that. I'm constantly breaking down (like this, actually) to them. I'd usually write all this shit and send it to a friend, but I'm tired of weighing them down with all this shit all the time. And don't even try to tell me that, \"It's you friends! That's what they're for!\" Bullshit. I can see the look on their faces. They don't want to loose me, but they're fucking tired of fighting. They've got their own problems too, they don't need to worry about whether or not I'm gonna jump of a bridge everyday too.\n\nFuck. Every time I look back on my life, I see nothing but failures. Being an extrovert is a bitch too, because I need to be around people to have any energy, but whenever I have energy, I act like a jackass, which makes me do, say, and act things that make me feel like a stupid jackass later on when I'm alone, which makes me want to go out less, which makes me have less energy, which makes my eventual social energy spikes even stronger, and the cycle goes on and on. Fuck it, people drained me instead, that would stop me from acting like an ass every time I'm being social. Of course, I never have enough self-awareness in the moment to control it. So I'm known  as this goofy dorky outgoing guy. It feels like a lie though, because whenever I'm alone, I'm depressed as hell. I also have anger issues, which make me feel like an even shittier person.\n\nAnd of course, like this, I go on long ass ramblings and tangents that really serve no purpose but to clear my head, so I'm just spitting out information and thoughts in such huge volumes. No one has ever said it, but I'm sure it's fucking annoying. It's annoying to me whenever I realize I'm doing it.\n\nFuck it, what's the point of any of this? It's almost 2018, and everyone is saying, \"Don't bring anything negative with you into 2018.\" What am I supposed to do then, kill myself within the next 4 hours? I absolutely am the only negative thing. I'm sure most people who know me would be shocked that I think any of this about myself. That's the power of being an extrovert, I'm just able to pull that positive energy out of my ass whenever I'm with people. It's ridiculous, and it makes me feel like a fake as fuck person, whether I'm being depressed or social. Almost everyone I know likes me, except me. And it's not like I plan to change for 2018 either. I don't have a plan, I don't have any goals. Once those 3 are out of highschool, I'm done, for real. I'll probably off myself before that honestly, because before then, I'll start college, and that'll give me a whole bunch of new opportunities to fuck up, which will really make me want to kill myself. Hell, maybe I'll join too many classes and clubs just to speed up the process quicker.\n\nI don't care. Fuck me.

I have had major depression and Anxiety since I was 12  \nI have no friends, only a few fake ones who just want nudes or sex from me. I don't do drugs I don't drink I don't have sex. I sit at home thinking about how great my life was before my mother went insane. My parents divorced, this sounds selfish but I lived in a big nice house and had lots of friends. Was on the states best soccer team and traveled. I had a whole family who loved me. That all came crashing down. When I was 12, My mother would threaten to kill herself and pretend to leave the house in front of me and my 5year old sister. I was very close with my mom so I would sob and sob begging her to come back. She also would fake faint and was always on  tons and tons of pain medicine, to the point where she would be passed out on the couch with white crust around her mouth and drooling. She told me her depression was my fault and I was a daughter From hell. \nThat's the back story. Now. With no friends, no team, and living in a fire hazard of a house in one of the most dangerous cities in the us and in the most dangerous area I live here with my grandmother and dad. Occasionally I get to see my sister but the other one hates me. I get so bored and lonely and I have such a fear of rejection because all relationships I have trusted were torn away. I am self conscious about myself but act cocky. I am smart but I have no motivation, so my grades were like a 2.0gpa. I failed myself and life. I text my aunt and she never responds. She has lost hope in me. I went to the hospital a year ago after trying to kill my self and accidentally leaving the suicide letters on my bed , and  I got a therapist, who I love most definitely, but I can't have a real relationship with her. I was doing really good in the summer but that came crashing too. When I say I have no motivation, I mean absolutely nothing. I have such high goals for myself, I was a 4.0 student in middle school. And high school isn't even that hard. I just don't want to do anything but sleep. Some days I feel on top of the world and some days I want to die. But when these days come by I suddenly have motivation and a strong urge to die. Not to get things done, just die. I just want to be loved but I am so needy nobody wants me. I try talking to old friends and they pretend they don't know me. I have the stuff ready but i question my rationality. But inside me I am being told to not think just do.

I can think of four girls off the top of my head with whom I have ceased being friends. One of them was a girl I virtually fell in love with at the end of freshman year and we were on track to be in what I thought was going to be a great relationship. I thought this was the thing I've been waiting for that will make all of this school bs worth it at the end of the day Then, at the end of the school year, she moved away. I'll never see her again. I never even got to kiss her. Ever since then, and without that blossom of hope which withered away in an instant, I've been depressed, lonely, and overall very demotivated and uninterested in the furtherance of my academic career. I barely passed half of my classes this semester, and it doesn't really feel worth the effort to try. This is because, at the end of every school day, after another seven and a half hours of sitting and listening and writing, all I do is sit at home and watch stupid youtube videos until I have to go to sleep and continue the next day. I don't get to hang with friends, I don't even really like my friends enough to want to. And now, on new year's eve night, I see snapchat stories with my friends and they are partying, drinking, socializing, and most importantly, enjoying themselves. I don't get that. I don't have that. All I've done tonight is relapse on my cutting problem that hasn't surfaced in two years; because I was bored, sad, and wanted some kind of release. It's not that I think it's fun or that it brings me joy. It's because I have nothing else to do. Especially nothing that gives me the unique release of sliding a razor blade through the skin on my shoulder. I don't get alcohol or friends or a new year's kiss. This is what I get and this is what I am. The only reason I don't seriously suicide is because I'm afraid of God and I'm afraid of what might happen to me in the afterlife. I just want a release. Something to look forward to at the end of the day. A vice, even.\nTL;DR: I'm really depressed and I feel like I'm in a rut that's impossible to get out of without some sort of release.

I played the game in Spanish, as I'm Mexican, but I'll do my best to translate what I remember. I'll share some more details in the recommended template below.\n\n**Platform(s):** Windows 95\n\n**Genre:** Various. Exploration, memory, point-and-click, as far as I remember\n\n**Estimated year of release:** Mid-Late 90's, around 1997, perhaps?\n\n**Graphics/art style:** Everything looked like it was \"hand-drawn\", but very pixelated. In the driving game I describe below, it attempted to be 3D like, but the textures were very clearly 2D.\n\n**Notable characters:** A little boy, maybe his name was Timmy? At least according to a cousin of mine I used to play this game with, it's what she told me she remembers. I used this clue to look the game up in the sub, and came across [this](https://redd.it/5gdium) post, which sounds similar, but none of the games suggested in the comments are the one I remember.\n\n**Notable gameplay mechanics:** One of the mini-games I remember was about driving and following directions that a female voice (maybe, I think the boy's parents were driving the car) would say out loud, so for example: \"Cross two street lights and on the third, turn left\".\n\nAnother one of the mini-games was this room where you would play Memory with different pairs of shoes that were in drawers, and whenever you would get the wrong pair, a bear would come out of one of the top drawers (I think) and say like \"No, that wasn't the correct shoe\".\n\nThe final mini-game I remember was something like a point-and-click in the boy's bedroom where you would find different items, and I think it was the middle of the night and I remember this always disturbing me a bit for some reason.\n\n**Other details:** I sooort of remember an entrance to the boy's house where there was a red-like path and some plants, or maybe trees? I also remember you could go to the backyard as well, and there you could play a mini-game although I don't remember which one. I think there was also something of a hand-drawing or hand-drawn like game, something like the color books for kids with the little numbers that say which colors to use. This was all sooooo long ago, I almost remember it like a dream, but I told two of my cousins who used to play with me, and they both remember similar details to the ones I just described here, so it must be real hahaha\n\nAny help finding this is truly truly appreciated :)\n\n**CORRECTION:** The title is supposed to say 'Mid-Late 90's'\n\n**EDIT:** According to my dad, maybe I'm confusing this game with Crayola Art-Studio (1994), at least the drawing part; because in his memory, the game I'm describing was in black and white, it seems.

I did it! Although they aren't the happiest, and they don't love it at all, my dad at least really supports me and they just want me to be happy. That doesn't mean they aren't reluctant to help me though.\n\nI should preface this by saying that I'm 15 - in Year 10 in an English school (the equivalent of a US high school freshman) and it is one of the most supportive schools on Earth. Not only do I have great friends who have taken nicely to my name and pronoun change, teachers in the school are willing to guide me through transition in school. But to do much, I really need my parents. If I want teachers to refer to me by my name (Alessia) and pronouns (she/her), then I need parental consent as I'm under 16. Convincing my parents to do that is so difficult - and I don't know why. It's not like it really affects them. I'm struggling to convince them that this isn't a phase and I'm not making the wrong \"decision\" (as if I chose to be trans), and I don't know what to do.\n\nMy mother always wanted a son, for years, through hardships, etc. and I feel so guilty to be taking that away from her; yet, she's the one not helping me. She wanted a normal family with grandchildren and her son married to a perfect wife: and my identity has threatened that. I'm struggling with that; my mother gives me everything for me to give nothing back.\n\nBoth of my parents are warming up to the idea of me being their daughter, slowly. They still don't think I'm ready, and I'm just a confused kid, but after months of convincing them and receiving a GP referral to GIDS Leeds (woot! even though it's at least a year away), they are finally starting to believe that this is what I need to be happy.\n\nAs soon as I can get this preferred (not even legal yet) name change, I can move on at any pace I like with transition in school. Uniform, gym class, bathrooms, etc. School is very much a safe space for me to be myself without worry about what the public think: I have tons of friends around me who love me for who I am, and in school is not what I or my parents are worried about.\n\nNa\u00efve as I am, I'm a lot less worried about the outside world than my parents. Perhaps it's because my dad works on discrimination cases all the time, but he is worried about me presenting as female in my kinda old-fashioned area. For example, he's worried about bullying or whatever on the public bus to school if I'm in girls' uniform. I'm struggling to convince him that I'll be okay and that I'd take a bus 30 minutes earlier to change in school if I had to, and I don't really know what to do to show them how important this is to me.\n\nAnd I don't even know where to go in transition. Where do I start? I don't really know what to do. I'm legally changing my name when I'm 16, but I have no idea how to take the step of clothing or anything else. I'm lost when it comes to outside of school - it's all so daunting.\n\nI'm sorry this post is so long! I've just had all this building up, and I was hoping I could get some advice from girls like me who know what I'm going through.\n\nAlways gotta find the bright side though: I updated my name and title on the NHS through my GP at my referral appointment a couple weeks ago!

Recently lost my virginity, became more and more out going slowly. I am 20 for reference. Going into my 6th semester of college, have been lifting for almost 3 years now. \n\nI don't want any pity from anyone but recently I started letting my family know I am more out there. I never felt any connection with anyone in my family until recently with my dad. I was having a serious talk with him and I thought the only way we connect personally is to tell him I've smoked weed and drank alcohol a few times. Don't know whether it was a good or bad decision but frankly don't care because it happened. He took it incredibly personal and made me feel guilty/bad about it till i realized he's just being a major drama queen and it has nothing do with him. Now he doesn't stop asking me if I'm behaving or not every single fucking day.\n\nIt's New Years Eve and my friends are having a small get together about 30 minutes from my house, he isn't letting me go. He started giving me a bunch of shit at first, \"people drink and drive its not safe for you please don't go, i have to go to work don't put this one me...\" then later told me \"i don't like your company, people have drank and smoked and ruined their life and i feel like you're addicted to it and i don't want you to do it.\" Him along with the rest of my family give me the same shit. I know for a fact his friends smoke cigarettes and all the bad shit he says he doesn't my friends doing.\n\nLast time I went to a night club my whole family was making fun of me because i told them i wasn't going to drink and that i was going there to dance with females. Everyone thought it was funny and I was an idiot for it. They even give me fucking shit for drinking monster or eating a certain food they don't like but then say \"we're not controlling you, we only care for you but never told you what to do and what not to do.\"\n\nMy main point of this post is, how do I let them know I want to be the man I WANT TO BE. Not what they want me to be. I know moving out is a sure fire way but I'm only 20, live in NYC, still going to college and only work part time. That isn't an option right now. I feel like I'm missing out on making friends and having a nice time. I know multiple stories of people who even got so drunk that they missed their finals in college yet run companies and are millionaires, yet my dad has this retarded thoughts about them. He always says, \"I've experienced the world, I know more.\" How do I let him know it's my turn to gain experience and that I know my capabilities and limits?\n\nMy whole family thinks I'm going to fail at life because I don't conform to their ways of kissing all my aunts asses every moment of everyday. They all think just because I like to be independent I am going to fail at life. I don't care what they say, but the fact that they blame my dad for it in the end and he does this shit with me is my main problem. These people won't even let me sleep over at a friends house, let me go to a friends house, not even going on an airplane ride alone, stay home alone or even fucking drive to another state for an hour or so. I appreciate all that they do for me but jesus fucking christ how do I change this shit and gain some freedom.

I hate talking to them. I hate having to interact with them. Sometimes just seeing another person happy upsets me. When people smile at me and try to make small talk, unless it's a girl I want to have sex with, I'm completely disinterested, and even if it is a girl that I'd want to have sex with, I still don't feel like putting in the energy required to get there, so I'm still disinterested, just slightly less so I suppose. I don't see the purpose in talking to someone unless I'm forced / pressured to or unless I can get something from it.\n\nI'm also nihilistic to supplement my misanthropy caused by introversion. Life has no point. I could die any minute, so what's the purpose of doing anything. Even if I don't die the next minute or the next 200 years, nothing I do is going to matter in the span of time, so why do it? Why does getting a job or grades matter? Why does living matter tbh.\n\nI suppose I should tell of the events that transpired that made me realize I am very misanthropic (I was already aware I was a nihilist for a while). I went to a BDSM party a few days ago. It was a subject that I was moderately interested in and wanted to try it out. I was greeted at the party, sat down, and for five hours, walked from corner to corner. I thought that since this was a subject I was interested in that I'd be interested in talking to people about it, but that wasn't the case. I was bored. Incredibly bored.\n\n I didn't go the party just for BDSM, but also to improve my social skills. I browsed Reddit self help subs before and other sites and one of the main things that I read was that you at some point are going to have to talk to people. So I figured (with help) that it'd be easier to talk to people who have a common interest since I'd be curious to know their thoughts. This party proved me wrong.\n\nIt wasn't that I wasn't interested in BDSM. I'm still interested right now. I just had absolutely no desire to talk to people and none to push myself to do so. I was hoping people would approach me instead, but that also wasn't the case. Because of that I had no social interaction that night. \n\nI came to a conclusion: no matter how much effort I try to put in or how much in common people have with me, I'll never be interested in talking to someone else unless I'm pressured or forced to. My only friends in college rn (I'm 18) are my suitemates. My friends in HS were all people I sat next to on the first day.\n\nAnd why should I have an interest in talking to people anyways? I despise social interaction. The way people have small talk. The way people get touchy feely and emotional. The way couples share their love for each other. The only reason people are worth talking to is if I get something from it. What I want mainly rn is sex. I don't have a desire for anything else, so I don't want / try to build any genuine friendships or long-lasting relationships. There's no point.\n\nI don't understand why is it that people want to talk to each other. What makes a person want to connect with another? It's boring as all hell. People are boring. Traveling, Going to the gym, Kayaking, Mountain Climbing, ~, Playing Video Games, Studying, Reading Books, Programming, they're all boring. Nothing is not boring. There is no one that from the bottom of my heart I have a genuine interest in talking to. Not even my parents.\n\nAnd yet, despite all of what I just said, I'm human, and succumb to human desires. I want to lose my virginity. I want to come home and have someone to come home to and someone to love. I have a desire for attention that caused me to make friends to begin with. But, I can't satsify any of these things because I hate humans and I hate all aspects of human interaction.\n\n\nIf you can't tell, yes, I do have depression, am diagnosed, and go to therapy / have had medication in the past. I'm 18 and male. If I had my friends describe, they'd list me as both cocky and self-deprecating at once. I'm here for Computer Science. I've never scored below an A in any technology course in my entire life. On my off time, I play rhythm games and shooting games. I'm a hipster, so I play unpopular games on purpose, so it's still hard to talk to people about video games. I don't work out, but I've still had people assume I'm fit. I have a horrible diet consisting of burgers, pizza, and the occasional fruits.\n\nWhy did I give you my background info? Because I want advice and it might help: how do I change my mentality? How do I get rid of my misanthropy, introversion, depression, nihilism, and find people to cure my longing for attention? How do I fix myself and make myself a better person? What steps do I take to improve my lifestyle?\n\nYes, I can post this in r/depression, r/getting_over_it, or if I added more details, r/suicidewatch or r/stopselfharm (I recently started thinking of cutting myself) but I find this subreddit to be one of the more helpful ones.

I make 50k at this job and only pay for my credit card phone bill. I do not drive so there are no car related expenses needed. I am 25 so I am still on my parents' health insurance, but that will of course disappear once I am 26. I always put 50% of my monthly income in savings, spend conservatively for the most part, pay off my credit card in full, have no student loans or debt of any kind. I maxed out my Roth IRA. No 401k, since that is not offered at my job.\n\nRecently, an acquaintance, John, has reached out to live together in New York because we have both expressed desires to move out from our parents' place. It seems like we both have stable financial backing for this move but where I start to get a little antsy is the cost of New York living, which I of course anticipated. It really doesn't seem plausible to find a place less than 12-14~/month per person. John doesn't seem to be too bothered by this since they make about 60k at a new job. He'd like to start looking at apartments very soon and would ideally like to move in February/March.\n\nI have been currently looking for a career change to not only increase cash flow but for my own edification as well. Before John reached out to me, my plan was new job &gt; reach out to him &gt; move. But of course, starting a job search a month before the holidays and not necessarily having all the skill sets has thrown off the timing a little. \n\nAnother wrench in my plans is that there is now a slight possibility of  moving outside of the US in order to pursue my new career in an internship. I reached out to someone who seemed interested in my work but suggested I learn a programming language that they use at their work and get back to him when I've created something cool. I am exhilarated at this opportunity but do not want to place all my eggs in one basket, so to speak. This potential city is a fraction of the price of New York, in which I could live conservatively from this paid internship. \n\nYou may ask, if you are willing to take an internship in another country, why not just do it New York and commute from your parents' place? The last wrench in this dilemma is that my home life is a little hairy to say the least and the commute is definitely having some physical side effects I did not foresee at the start of my job a year ago. While I of course do not expect anything to be handed to me, it seems like this new city is a lot more financially forgiving, while providing the basic level of Maslow's hierarchy of needs to all its citizens, which is just not possible in the US, let alone New York. \n\nHas anyone been in this situation before? Do I put the brakes on John's plans of moving and hope this potential internship works out? Do I just keep grinding away at finding a job in New York and go one with the move with John? Or the most expensive option of just moving in with John and then breaking the lease if the internship works out? \n\nWould really appreciate some input!

Kurzgesagt has a great video on it.\n\nThe Cotsworth calendar consists of 13 months, each with 28 days, 4 weeks. The new month is between June and July, named Sol.

Year Day doesn't fall on any day of the week, it's its own special day, a holiday. On leap years, a day is added after June 28, Leap Day. The benefit to this calendar is that every date is always on the same day, every month, every year, forever. No more asking \"What day is the 18th this month?\" because you already know that it's Wednesday. Next month, too, and the next, and next year. It's much more organized than our shoddy gregorian calendar where some months span six weeks. On top of that, every 13th is a Friday.\n\nI also propose we write dates as yyyyy-mm-dd-(tttt).

( Couldn't spell his last name fuck it). Dean Pees is the one constant variable with the defensive collapses. There is no arguing it, players have been added and lost and Dean Pees still remains and the collapses continue on. Whigs is fucking annoying, totally off and on. Really fucks with us sometimes it's ridiculous. Unfortunately I'm going to blasted for this, but fuck it. John Harbaugh also has been a constant variable since the Superbowl, as thankful as I am about it I'm also disappointed in his constant mediocrity since his big win. His best record year since then was 2014 when we were 10-6. To put this in perspective these two coaches Harbaugh and Dean Pees who have been with us since the Superbowl have had the following seasons. \n\n2013: 8-8 season, choked away postseason against the Bengals. \n2014: 10-6 season and playoff entry blew 14 point leads against the pats\n2015: 5-11 season just a perfect storm really\n2016: 8-8 with epic Christmas collapse\n2017: 9-7 epic New year's collapse against the bengals.\n\nThis is a 5 year slate, these numbers dont lie. The collapses need to stop, getting better players won't help on defense. Christ's sake, talent is stacked at each level of the defense. The constant variable is Dean Pees, we know that. But what about John harbaugh, it seems to be more and more evident John Harbaugh's\nearly success is due to the fact that he inherited a good team, with Ray Lewis and Ed reed defense, Ray rice and early joe flacco offense. Look what happened since those players have left, nothing. Perhaps maybe our problem isn't lack of talent, it's coaching. The offense believe it or not isn't bad, the receivers are actually pretty good. Mike Wallace has been a good addition since we got him, Jeremy maclin. Although off and on, if he can find his old self he would be very good. What about Chris moore?. What about ben Watson?.If we can get a good o line and a good coordinator like Gary kubiak, then we will set on offense. The defense is fine, just needs a different coach with a new mindset. \n\nJohn Harbaugh, I'm honestly leaning toward keeping him one more year and see if a coordinator change makes a difference, see how big a difference kubiak made in 14?. But it's also possible he has run his course, perhaps the message has died out. His team seemed totally unprepared for the playoff push this day, that is telling. It took us a whole half to figure it out and obviously you saw how that worked out. I'm 25 percent in the direction that we should get rid of him now, because keep in mind that the leaders of this team flacco and suggs aren't getting younger. Do we really have time to mess around with this?. Again I'm leaning toward keeping Harbaugh for another year. But if another collapse keeps us out of contention, or if another 8-8 year happens. Then it's time to part ways.

That all being said, every list I faced and bested on Friday was tier 1-2, and this thing is a HELL of a good time.\n\n\n.\n\n\n**Contents**\n\n1) Deck overview/list\n\n2) Specific Matchups in the order I faced them\n\n3) Potential Changes/Improvements\n\n.\n\n\n#**List/Overview**\n\nTo start, the lineup:\n\n****** Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game Deck List ******\n\n##Pok\u00e9mon - 18\n\n* 4 Zorua BKT 89\n* 1 Zoroark BKT 91\n* 4 Zoroark-GX SLG 77\n* 1 Sudowoodo BKP 67\n* 1 Reshiram SLG 14\n* 1 Shaymin SLG 7\n* 1 Cobalion STS 74\n* 1 Latios SLG 41\n* 1 Mimikyu GRI 58\n* 3 Tapu Lele-GX GRI 60\n\n##Trainer Cards - 32\n\n* 1 Mallow GRI 127\n* 1 Rescue Stretcher GRI 130\n* 4 Puzzle of Time BKP 109\n* 2 Brigette BKT 134\n* 1 Special Charge STS 105\n* 1 Field Blower GRI 125\n* 4 Guzma BUS 115\n* 4 N NVI 92\n* 2 Enhanced Hammer GRI 162\n* 4 Ultra Ball SLG 68\n* 3 Choice Band GRI 121\n* 2 Float Stone BKT 137\n* 3 Professor Sycamore PHF 101\n\n##Energy - 10\n\n* 3 Rainbow Energy SUM 137\n* 3 Counter Energy CIN 100\n* 4 Double Colorless Energy SUM 136\n\nTotal Cards - 60\n\n\n#**How Does This Work?**\n\nThe original premise of the deck was to use counter energy and just take cheeky KOs when behind, but the obvious downside of assuming a negative position in prizes wasn't the best plan. From there, the focus shifted to simply being \"Several options attacking efficiently and threatening surprising plays in an uncomfortable play state\". Trade allows you to access your many options, and puzzles allow you to recycle/reset. Each matchup can be vastly different and requires a specific plan on what cards to use and how early to reveal your techs.\n\nBasically, you're attacking with Zoroark GX quite often (especially when pressuring evo lines early with Guzma), ALWAYS ensuring that your opponent will need to take 4+ KOs for victory, and just generally be unfamiliar with what options you yourself have to swing back with. \n\n.\n\n#**A general thought-process from beginning to end:**\n\n**Super Early Game**\n\n Brigette/Sycamore to establish Zorua/Zoroark Line ASAP, to build a strong drawn engine. \n\n\n**Early Game**\n\nPressure. 4 Guzma and Zoroark GX allow you to hit something for 120-150 with relative consistency on turn 2, but turn 3 being a common occurrence as well. These numbers really matter, even if you're not taking KO's early. Against evo decks (think Garde) thin lines and take an early prize or two. \n\n**Midgame**\n\nConsider your midgame threat option. This could include several or one of your tech attackers. For the sake of example and without going into detail; against Garde you'd need to consider Cobalion for the Garde itself, or Mimikyu for Gallade, or Baby Zoro if they bench 5. At this point you should know where your 6 prizes are going to come from. Trade.\n\n*A key decision in the mid game is whether or not to reveal your counter tech, or save it in hand/deck for a surprise play. Oftentimes benching/attaching early on can apply more valuable pressure than attempting to always work towards a \"trap card' mindset.*\n\n**Late Game**\n\nAlways keep eyes on Guzma/Puzzle counts, and know exactly which poke will be taking those final two prizes. Energy is key here obviously, especially with E-Hammer reigning supreme. Know what you'll need to puzzle for, and when to go for it. trading often early should leave you with a small, but efficient set of possible cards in-deck to make your final play. \n\nOftentimes at this stage you've just outpaced your opponent, but close games are where you REALLY need to be practiced with this list, as there are a multitude of small decisions that could affect the outcome. \n\n\n.\n\n\n#**Matchups from the Tournament**\n\nI'll be keeping these overviews quite short, but am more than happy to answer specific questions about each in the comments if you have particular interest in one, or several!\n\n**Round 1: Garde**\n\nBrigette turn 1, Guzma turns 2  and 1 for KO's on ralts and Kirlia, all while benching a Mimikyu with a counter energy on it (Opponent was clearly playing for the Gallade). Once Gallade swung for KO on Zoroark, Mimikyu to active, attach rainbow energy, KO. With 2 lele's and a Octillary in play, my opponent scooped.\n\n**Round 2: Lycanrok/Zoro**\n\nTurn 2 I guzma KP his only Zoruo while simultaneously e-hammering the strong energy on a rockruff. The game basically ended right there. \n\n**Round 3: Volc**\n\nOpponent smartly never benched 5, taking away the Baby-zoro KO option I often lean on in this matchup. Outside of that, Latios came in clutch. After taking 2 prizes early on a Lele and Hitting 2 Separate Volcs for 150 apiece, Latios pinged both for 4 prizes, taking win 3 prizes to 0. On a side note, I really enjoyed this player as a person. If you're seeing this, I was very happy to have met you!\n\n**Round 4: Buzzwole/Lycanrok against Ross Cawthon**\n\nThis game was incredibly close. I apologize for not remembering this specifics, but it game down to a Sudowoodo Counter-Dangerous-rogu-ing a Lycanrok while prepping to Guzma a 150 HP Lele (Latios had pinged it earlier, a recurring theme) for game. I was N'd to 2, and traded twice for double puzzle for game, zero cards in deck. \n\n**Round 5: ID (to the player I'd face in first round of top 8)**\n\n**Game 6: Goli Garb**\n\nThis game was against a good friend of mine, and we debated the logistics of me just scooping (he was 4-1 at the time and unsure of how resistance would come into play if we ID). So... that's exactly what we did. He took the win and we both made top cut, my OPP WIN% sitting at **69%**\n\n.\n\n#**Top 8 Play**\n\nVS Vika Bulu. PTSD from Bunyip stomps making my heart skip a beat.\n\n*Game 1*\n\nBoth start with very strong setup, 2 vika+2Bulu+lele+oranguru on board for my opponents. Bulu KO'd a Reshiram I had annoyingly pinging him for 5 in the active, after which I 1HKO with Baby Zoroark, which is return KO'd by Second Bulu... At which point I'd traded a million times and prepped a Zorua on the bench. Double Puzzle for Baby zoro for another 1HKO (opponent had to bench/prep 3rd Bulu), and Sudowoodo Swung for 180 for final KO 1 turn later. \n\n*Game 2*\n\nI brick for 3 turns. I'm donked turn 4 after 3 manual attachments\n\n*Game 3*\n\nOpponent has slow start with turn 3 vika. At that point I've KO'd a lele and have Answers for 2 Bulus. Take series. \n\nWin, 2-1\n\n.\n\n\n#**Top 4 Play**\n\nVS my good buddy from round 6, playing Goli Garb. \n\n*Game 1*\n\nStrong setup on both sides, with the advantage going to me after 2 early Guzma onto Trubbish/Garb. Following that I traded for everything I could possibly need, took a 1HKO with Reshiram, and shuffled for game 2 hardly believing my own performance. \n\n*Game 2*\n\nAn odd start where we both were basically 1 turn behind. Reshiram Pings Golisapods for 100 dmg for a DCE until he's forced to Crossing Cut GX it for KO. Following that, I trade with him more efficiently, now that the 1HKO onto Lele option is off the table for the Goli. At one point in the mid game I puzzle for blower to bring 3 Zoro GX's online. Trade for days and slow play my way to game.\n\nWin, 2-0\n\n\n.\n\n\n#**Finals VS Austen Vance**\n\n*Game 1* \n\nHit the turn 1 Brigette in hand, and then slowly watch as Austen takes 3 free prizes as I dead draw. I played a Puzzle turn 1 as well to see top 3 cards... 3 Zoroark, which would have been great if he didnt have Toxin online turn 2. turn 4 draw Blower to trade into Sycamore. 20 minutes later I've clawed back and I'm 1 turn from winning. I take KO on A Goli, my only win condition to be pulling 1 of the 3 prized guzma to win following turn.... 3 of last 4 prizes are Guzmas. 2 turns later Opponent takes game. \n\n*Game 2* \n\nA straight up, very close game that was played perfectly on both sides, and with each of us 1 Guzma from game, I N him to 1, he top decks Guzma. At that point, I wasn't even angry, just happy to have played the best I could :)\n\nLoss, 0-2\n\n\n.\n\n\n#**Final Thoughts/Potential Changes**\n\nAll I can say is that I'm incredibly happy to have performed well with a list of my own creation. In pokemon, I've always (illogically) shied away from playing the top archetypes as it usually felt cheap and unrewarding, being someone else's build/idea. This list isn't perfect, and CERTAINLY won't be seen at top tables for any regional, but it's mine!\n\nFor changes, some ideas include:\n\n- Swap in/out certain counter energy techs to account for meta swings\n\n- Add 4th Sycamore... somehow\n\n- Add 2nd blower. Again, somehow\n\n- Add 3rd Brigette/4th (!) Lele to make turn 1 spicy\n\n... and that's all really. My list was great for the day and there isn't much I'd swap out. \n\n\nWhile I don't think my deckis tier 1 in any sense, I'm happy to say that I've created something far better than myself or my playgroup originally imagined it to be. I certainly hope to continue to improve upon the concept, and appreciate the very, VERY few of you who actually read this silly thing :)\n\nHappy new year everyone, I always appreciate ya'll!\n\nStove\n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"pkmntcg","subreddit_id":"t5_2s9kv","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"60-Master League Cup Report: 2nd Place with Counter-Box Zoroark","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/pkmntcg/comments/7nd1h8/60master_league_cup_report_2nd_place_with/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}

You wake up, a tingling between your thighs, memories of the night before flooding back and your juices begin to flow with fondness and a familiar ache between your legs, a job well done.\n\n\nHis bedroom was cold, from the window left open overnight, you regret asking for it as a shiver rolls up your spine, looking back though you were both so hot and sweaty, not surprising considering the way he held you in the air and screwed you hard and deep, under the strength of his own body. You snuggle deeper into his muscular chest, causing the chains and ropes, mounted to the headboard of the four poster bed, to rattle.\n\n\nYou lift your head off his chest, where you had fallen asleep content, to look at his still sleeping face. Under the sheets you see a hard cock, and climb under the duvet and begin to play with it. His sleeping body responds to your ministrations, cock swelling harder and larger, a light but guttural growl rumbles in his chest. Pre-cum begins to drip from his cock as your hands sleepily move and caress my body.\n\n\nYour fingers expertly massage the juices into the head of his cock, lubricating the tip as you wrap your palm around the shaft, twisting your wrist as your hand moves up and down the shaft of his cock making it twitch from pleasure.\n\nYour head moves down kissing down his chest as it rapidly rises and falls, getting lower and lower until you his my swollen member, head almost purple from anticipation and pre-cum oozing from the tip.\n\nYour tongue extends gingerly, tasting the flowing juices, the moment they hit your tongue, your head snaps forward, lips engulfing the head of the cock, sucking hard, you try to drain more from it.\n\nDisappointed that no more will come, you slide your head slowly down the cock, keeping a vacuum seal around his shaft, gliding until cock hits the back of your throat; you take a moment to feel his throbbing member between your lips and then dive further down, until your nose hits his crotch.\n\nHe awakes with a start, to look down and see your head impaled on his cock and your throat massaging the tip of his cock, hands slide down and weave themselves in your hair, pulling you off of his cock, he begins to guide your head, setting the pace and depth as you sensuously bob your head on his cock.\n\nHe whispers \u201cBaby, I\u2019m almost there, keep going\u201d to you, making you quiver as a wave of pleasure rocks your own body. You move your hands from his inner thighs to rest on top of the hands laced through your hair and force them to make fists of your hair. The hint to take control was not lost and he scrunches his hands tightly through your hair and begins using your face as he sees fit. Having almost cum, it only took about three strokes of his cock, deep in your throat, to cum, spilling the first few spurts directly into your stomach, before pulling back and putting the rest into your mouth.\n\nHands in your hair move to gently cup your face as he pulls you away from his cock, to a gentle kiss upon your lips. Opening your mouth, you let the remnants of his cum dribble from your mouth, to his. The pair of you continue to kiss as he rolls on top of you, letting some of his cum flow back from his mouth, back to yours before swallowing the rest. Reinforcing the kiss, he presses his lips hard into yours as fingers trace the lines of your body.\n\nAs he lay on top of you, his body pressed tightly against your own, kissing deeply, his cock comes to rest on top of your mound, shaft rubbing against your clit as you grind together. He sat back on is haunches, looking at you expectantly, grabbing his head you force his face down into your pussy, he lined his tongue up with your clit and stopped for a moment to look up at your sex-worn, perfect face and couldn\u2019t believe that you had known each other for months as friends, but all it had taken was one night of too much drinking to break through all of the sexual tension that had been building. His tongue begins to do small circles on your clit, causing you to let out a small moan and dig your nails into his arm. He slips two fingers inside your pussy and begins to massage your g spot, sending waves of pleasure across your whole body, making you beg for more. \u201cFaster\u201d you barely manage to whisper to him as he starts slowing down the circles on your clit, teasing you.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI was then thinking a 24 hours earlier type deal would let us set up the descriptive part of the story\n\nMe: I'm 22, Male, English, slim near underweight, not quite toned, but there is muscle under the skin and average height.
