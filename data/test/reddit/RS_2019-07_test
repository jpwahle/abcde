I recently got a giant scholarship that allows me to move out of my mothers basement and into a place of my own. I was originally going to be moving with a friend that needs to get away from his abusive parents, but that fell through. I would have stayed at home when that happened, but my mom found about my moving out and flipped out. She left a very nasty note cussing me out and demanding her truck back. Keep in mind that while she owns the truck, I have been paying EVERYTHING on it the last 2 years. \n\nThe ironic part is that she has no income save for a child support payment that rarely comes. Like, she has NO income and depends on my and my siblings (2 older siblings) to keep up with house payments, utilities, etc. She is very disabled but owns the house we live in and most of the possessions, including the truck. This puts us in a very annoying situation where if we all live together, things are cheaper for each of us but mom has everything in her name. I tried to get the internet bill in my name since I was paying it and need to build credit but she flipped out at that too because of how \"carefully balanced\" she has everything so she could get food stamps but allow everyone to live in the same household. \n\nShe doesn't share information, she doesn't compromise on anything yet she is disabled and completely depends on us for money. She even has student loan debt  that I, a college student, have had to make payments on so she doesn't default. \n\nI am leaving the house to live on my own, and while learning how to live on my own (health insurance, food), I found out she has done a terrible job of raising her kids. I never got my wisdom teeth taken out (boy do those hurt now), I never got braces, and we ate junk food growing up. She is rotten with money and buys things like variable rate mortgages, spends money eating out, and thinks that having 70% of the house as storage space for her stuff is perfectly acceptable. Luckily I am trying to be responsible and am building credit, enrolling in health insurance, and generally trying to get my life together this next semester. \n\nMy really big takeaway is that learning to be independent and cutting toxic people out of your life is the best thing possible for yourself.

I knew when I was pretty young (like 9 years old, when my sister was born and she was an impossible terror as a child) that I didn't want kids, but I also thought that I'd eventually grow out of it and have children like a normal person. But my feelings about having children didn't change, and in my mid 20s I \"came out\" as childfree.  \n\nBeing open about not wanting to have children has caused problems for me in the workplace. When I was 23-24 I was much more vocal about being CF. I've since learned to stfu and I do not mention my childfree status unless specifically asked. Like if someone asks if I have kids, I don't even say \"no I don't want kids,\" I say no and leave it at that because of the shit it's caused in the past. The worst experience I had was with a female coworker who had five kids. She was deeply offended by my not wanting to have children, and she let me know it. Every day. She told me I wasn't a real woman, that I was going to hell, that I was mentally ill, all kinds of unpleasant things. Eventually I had to go to HR. I don't know what they said to her, but she ended up quitting not long after.  \n\nIt hasn't been quite as bad in my most recent employers, but people have made it known that they thought it was \"weird\" that I didn't want kids. Literally every woman I've worked with directly over the last 2 years have been mothers. Some were grandmothers. So even though no one personally attacked me, I was still very much an odd duck when it came to the subject of kids, which is why I decided not to mention it to anyone other than close friends and family.  \n\nI've been at my current job for a year now, and I work with not one but TWO other women who don't have kids. Both of these woman are in their 50s. Now, to be fair, I don't know their circumstances and I'd never ask. For all I know, maybe they wanted kids and couldn't have them, or they had a kid that passed away. But I do know that the existence of these two women has removed any awkwardness or tension that I used to feel around my CF status, because my other coworkers are already used to it. It's not an oddity. And as a result, I feel more comfortable at work and I feel like I can completely be myself and not worry about being judged or berated.  \n\nAlso, as sort of a trivial materialistic side note, one of the women I work with carries a very expensive handbag (I looked it up, it's no less than $3000). She loves the crap out of it and carries it every single day. For some reason I really love seeing it because it's like a reminder of all the things you can with your money when you don't have kids.

I was on the go ALL the time and had no time for basic needs like eating and sleeping. So when I started feeling a small lump near my spine that was radiating a small pain I just ignored it to keep up with my busy schedule. Over the next week that small pain grew to an excruciating, swollen, hot to the touch, red, 4\"x2\" area that was giving off radiatng pains, shooting pains, and a constant headache. I couldnt lay on my back, I couldnt sit, I couldnt bend over; I was so miserable! I finally told both my jobs, I need to go to a clinic I cant handle this pain anymore. My cyst was so bad that when i showed the doctor, she brought in more nurses and some students to look at it. She just kept exclaiming \"WHY did you not come in sooner?!\" Half an hour later I was at a specialists office being numbed up and drained out. The doctor put a plug in to continue the drainage and sent me on my way. I was still sore but it was INSTANT relief. Since then (I am 23 now.) I have had 4 more episodes. Previously I would use PRID on a bandage to draw my cyst to head but it took about a week each time. The last two times I made a really basic paste that has brought the cyst to head in TWO days. \nHere is my step by step guide. \n\n1. Take a paper towel and fold it one fold larger than the size of your cyst.\n\n2. Dampen the entire paper towel with apple cider vinegar. (Damp not soaked.) \n\n3. Sprinkle an even thin layer of tumeric over the apple cider vinegar. \n\n4. Fold the paper towel one last time so that the tumeric is on the inside of the paper towel. \n\n5. Apply paper towel to affected area and add bandage. Leave on for a couple hours.\n\n6. When you remove everything rinse the area with warm soapy water and then pat dry.\n\n7.

If more than one or two of these are true for you, some breathing exercises might be in order!\n  \n1) You buy a new acne product every time you go out \n \n \n \n2) you have conversations, arguements, and attempt to make deals with your acne \n \n \n \n3) A quick trip to pee turns into a half hour stare at the mirror session \n \n \n \n4) your rearview mirror in your car is facing you (you dont have to fess up to this one...)\n \n \n \n5) when theres no mirrors available, you snap stealth selfies of your face to examine your acne \n \n \n \n6) you've named your acne (might not be a bad coping strategy but still) \n \n \n \n7) you've neglected your exercise routine and gotten out of shape because you dont want to leave the house or feel working out might aggravate your condition \n \n \n \n8) you've ranked the mirrors in your house based on how your skin looks in them \n \n \n \n9) you've developed your own internal ranking system for each individual pimple based on how embarrassing it is (e.g. - this is a level 5 pimple or something)\n \n \n \n10) success stories on \/r\/acne frustrate you and make you jealous\n \n \n \n11) what you look forward to most every day is when you can turn off the lights and go to sleep for a brief reprieve from your life with acne\n \n \n \n \nObviously, this post does not apply to everyone and probably not even the majority here. But if you're here because your hurting, I'm with you. I'm 34 years old today (my bday gift was a huge under-skin pimple on my nose), and have been suffering for 20 years, this past year being especially bad. \n \n \n \nI wouldnt wish this suffering on anyone, especially to the young people here with their entire lives ahead of them. There are much bigger things in life than deciding which cream you're going to put on at bedtime tonight. \n \n \n \nWe need to change the way we think about ourselves. You are not just someone with imperfect skin. You are athletes, you are artists, you are teachers, you are scholars, you are role models. You are caring, good people. I see your faces on here every day. You're beautiful. \n \n \n \nSo when you stare at yourself for 45 minutes before bed tonight (remember dont pick!) Try to look past the pimples and inside yourself. Be proud of what you've accomplished and look forward to reaching your goals. I only wish I would have done that myself, as I'm sure I'd have been a much more confident person today.

My father and grandfather were abusive, sexually, emotionally and physically. My grandfather was drunk constantly. My PTSD is triggered just from being around men, specifically in public and those I don't know. My stepdad is really the only one I can go without having a panic attack around, and even then I still feel horrifically uncomfortable. At about 6 years old my world got flipped. We moved away from my friends that took me years to make. I remember clinging to my mother, I was so afraid to leave her to make friends. I bawled my eyes out. Other than these people who I no longer have contact with, I've never, in my entire life had a friend in real life. I can't work around men because of my PTSD. I still struggle to get out of bed, fuck, some days I sleep a full 24 hours without waking up. Other days I'll get at most two hours. My idea of going out to try to find friends is walking to the grocery store and hoping that someone notices how miserable I look and approaches me. I've had two long-term relationships, lasting about a year and a little under two years respectively. Both times I was cheated on, which only helped to shatter my already non-existent self-confidence. My mother also played a part in shattering whatever image I had of myself, although unintentional. She tells me I'm brilliant. Genuinely one of the smartest she's ever met, book, street and emotionally. Given that I struggle to leave bed most days, out of anger she told me that if she could just take whatever I had in terms of smarts and give it to my sister who happens to also struggle with anxiety, she'd be so much happier. She realized what she said, tried to take it back, but it was too late. It was far, far too late. I've attempted to commit twice, wound up in the ER many more times. I'm sitting on three friends, all of whom have played a full one third in my being alive still today. They all live across the country. They don't like each other, so I can't really ever have group conversations with them. They're all female, so I feel super comfortable talking to them individually. Other than that, all I really want to do is be a therapist. I haven't gone to school yet, though I'm looking into it. I tend to use Omegle and talk to people who are considering committing. I think at this point I've talked about 10 or so out of it. No one except for my three friends and those who have had trouble coming out on Omegle know that I'm bi. Not even my own family. I don't live for myself anymore. I don't like myself. Quite frankly, I'd say I hate myself. I'm alive to this day only because of those I've helped and the fact that I've made promises to them to help others. If it wasn't for those promises, I'd be long gone right now.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TrueOffMyChest","subreddit_id":"t5_2yuqy","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TrueOffMyChest","subreddit_subscribers":344450,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I don't live for myself anymore","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/c7lux5\/i_dont_live_for_myself_anymore\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Now I can't go back, and it's scary but also liberating knowing there is a way to live where I don't feel detached and depressed all the time, and more to life than how I've gotten used to living. I feel relief and liberation, but also grief and crippling dysphoria.\n\nI have been on a rollercoaster of emotions, and feel sick to my stomach and I'm crying every day (but not necessarily in a bad way?). I had euphoria at the beginning when I got my first binder, but now it just seems I feel dysphoric all the time and feel sick and sad when I look in the mirror. I'm overwhelmed when I think of the future. I can't. Yet thinking of medical transition is the only thing that keeps me going (yet it is also going to change everything).\n\n It's not like the dysphoria wasn't there before, I was just so out of touch with my emotions and body that I guess I got used to it, I thought that was how everyone felt. I built a hard defense shell too (like trying so hard to be hyper hyper femme, alcohol, distractions, getting used to a baseline level of anxiety and fighting with my body I guess?) Now it's all crumbled.\n\nI feel like I'm going crazy. Every day is a battle and I'm just focusing on one day at a time (for perspective, I have a lot of mental health issues but I've always been able to keep it together before and be a \"high achiever\" objectively speaking even if I was suffering on the inside). \n\nDoes it get better as you transition, or just harder from here? It makes me so overwhelmed and sick knowing my old life is gone (maybe not dead, but never will be the same again). Most of the narratives you hear in the media are \"I knew all along\" or excitement over transition. I am excited sometimes but it's also so difficult and such a rollercoaster. Any advice is so appreciated. Has anyone experienced this at the beginning? \n\nThank you \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ftm","subreddit_id":"t5_2t9mw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ftm","subreddit_subscribers":55844,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Coming out ftm: grief, emotions, rollercoaster?","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ftm\/comments\/c7lxp1\/coming_out_ftm_grief_emotions_rollercoaster\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

I am 8 weeks pregnant and my SP wants to properly break up once he moves out. He doesn\u2019t want the baby. We unofficially got back together a month after we broke up back in October and have been rocky ever since. I feel like I always manifest halfway, things will seem like they\u2019re going well and he seems ready to commit and then I start doubting things and something bad happens and all the hard work gets us back to square one. \n\nThe reason he wants to break up isn\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t love me, it\u2019s because he says he isn\u2019t ready for a relationship and he can\u2019t commit to only me (he has been continuously taking to other girls) and doesn\u2019t want me to get hurt. Sometimes he says that he knows that I am the person he wants to marry and that even though things suck at the moment, in the end we will be together. Other times he doesn\u2019t want to promise anything because he doesn\u2019t want me to wait for him, he wants me to be happy. \n\nI am really confused about the pregnancy thing. The thing is that I was pregnant just before this time but I had a miscarriage early on. Before this he was supportive and said that either way we will manage and it\u2019s not the end of the world, just a change in direction and that we can still achieve what we want. This time round he is polar opposite and I don\u2019t know why. He said he would rather drive his car into a tree then be a father right now (he had a bit to drink so that could\u2019ve affected things). The first time he said that we could move away and start fresh together, this time he was talking about imagine raising a child broken up and that he would have no life. \n\nThe real problem is how young we are, I am 19 in 3 weeks and he is 21. We are in university studying to be nurses, he has a job but I don\u2019t. Even though we are unprepared I have faith that things will be okay, because I know it\u2019s not impossible to raise a child while studying. He is coming to the first ultrasound and I am hoping that will help him consider keeping it.\n\nI really don\u2019t know what to do, I don\u2019t have long to decide on keeping the baby or not even though I don\u2019t want to have an abortion whatsoever, I feel like I don\u2019t have a choice.

I've never really made up my mind about kids. I've always thought that I was young and still had plenty of time to enjoy life before really considering settling down and having, or not having kids. I'm still in that mindset. I really don't see myself having kids any time soon if I do have them at all. I am open to it if I meet the right person who I want to spend the rest of my life with and can see myself raising children with. Though I don't really want to think about it for another couple years (3-5). I also feel like I want to stay in the city for longer than she does (but not forever).\n\nShe's also talks about moving away (to another city) in about a year's time. I don't know how serious she is about this but I do not want to move.\n\nI have told her all of this, though maybe in a bit more vague terms with less exact numbers and such. She basically told me to make up my mind within a couple months as she does not want to have her time wasted. I totally get this.\n\nThat being said, I just want to have a relationship with someone, enjoy our time together and have fun without making up my mind about kids, or deciding if I want to spend my life with this girl. \n\nI guess what all this boils down to is that I'm dating to enjoy life with another person and make memories (in a serious, long-term, committed relationship), and she's dating to find someone really serious to spend her life with and raise a family.\n\nI don't know yet if this girl is someone who I want to spend the rest of my life with and probably won't in couple more months either. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? She is really amazing and I genuinely enjoy being with her. I am open to falling in love and could potentially have a family assuming everything falls into place, but I'm just not going to be deciding that any time soon.\n\nThanks for any advice","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dating_advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2s4kl","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dating_advice","subreddit_subscribers":955968,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Guys who are unsure about having kids, how do you date seriously?","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/c7m0o3\/guys_who_are_unsure_about_having_kids_how_do_you\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I'm 23, four years ago I was diagnosed with myoclonic epilepsy however I don't feel like the diagnosis entirely fits my symptoms. \nI first noticed something wrong when I had verbal ticks along with myoclonic jerks which eventually ran up to and over hundred times a day. I assumed this was purely psychological and this led me to some personal actions I regret. I was handed over to a psych ward and given a five minute and 24 hour EEG and diagnosed with myoclonic\/generalized epilepsy. I have never had a tonic clonic seizure but am apparently at high risk for one. \n      An important part of my symptoms is how my psychological issues tie into my seizures. You know that painful \"cringe\" feeling you get when remembering something embarrassing or picturing something awful? That will instantly trigger a jerk in less than a second after the thought pops into my head. With a diagnosis of OCD and panic disorders, this must be the reason for which these thoughts occur more frequently. However, the seizures can also present themselves randomly. \n       The physical aspects of these seizures range from a slight tremor\/jerk to absence to something that from the observer's perspective would appear to be tonic clonic. The most debilitating ones have lasted as long as three hours of almost non-stop movement due to a panic attack so kinda like a feedback loop. During these I am fully lucid and able to speak somewhat proficiently. I must stress that this is not shaking, it is fully convulsive. It has led me to jokingly refer to my situation as \"Obsessive Convulsive Disorder\".\n  I have been seeing a neuropsychiatrist and have been deemed medication resistant. I am using my last resort and have scheduled my pre-op appointment for VNS therapy.\n   I have never met anyone with a similar condition and would very much appreciate any response. \n        All the best,\n                       Jacob","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Epilepsy","subreddit_id":"t5_2s1h9","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Epilepsy","subreddit_subscribers":10617,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Is this just me?

So, it is of no surprise to anyone that I am here searching for someone to explore this universe.  \n\n\nMy hope is to play one of the unmentioned goddesses or mortals to create a delightfully sweet romance of our own.

Let's get attached to our characters together.  \n\n*  Let's be friends! If we're role playing together we obviously have something in common. We should be able to speak comfortably out of character.   \n\n*  Most important? Accept that I am a hopeless romantic. I like the sappiness of it all, and I hope that you will too.

I am 15 right now I have no idea how old I was I dont remember very well (I think was somewhere from 10 to 12) but the thing that was weird was that I expected a divorce because of all the fighting so I was not very upset about it. But anyway fast forward to 2 years ago I met my soon to be Step Mom for the first time my first impressions of her were not great I first saw her kissing my Dad which pissed me off because I had no idea who she was at all. But fast forward to sometime of Mayish 2018 mine and my Dad relationship has decreased drastically my Sister or Britger disliked my new Step Mom (I did not mention this but I found out they got married a week after the fact) but I had plenty of fights with my Dad about anything he continued to bash that my Mom put all these thoughts into my head and he did not understand that I got these thoughts. So continuing to just before July 29th I was told by my Mom to go to my Dads and we would go camping I disagreed but I had to go my mom said call if their are any issues (now that I said that I assume you know there are issues because the date was so specific I remember the exact date). So I go camping no real issues until the day we were leaving my Brother was not in the best mood so he was packing up his fishing stuff and he put it into the back of my Dads truck and my Step Mom asked my Brother to help me he said no he was doing that which is kinda understandable. He walks away to get more of his stuff thwn she throws his stuff out of the truck he get mad at her and says what the fuck are you doing or something like that she then slightly pushes him then slaps him(I have no idea if a step parent can slap the stepchild in my state). So my brother pushes her back and then my Dad comes I was told by my sister and brother that my Step Mom put my Brother in a head lock I dont know if it was true or not though I did not see that part because I was looking at my Dad. He was going to my Brother he comes over and pushes my Brother to the ground and my Brother has a bad shoulder so he dislocated his shoulder. I \"run\" away from all the commotion and hide I call my Mom who calls the police and they show up and yeah. So my siblings are put on a protection order me and my Sister are took off is soon while my Brother is on it until February I though still refuse to go to my Dads house. My Brorher gets depressed and starts to vape this just increases my anxiety about him so there for I am now highly against anyone vaping. So he is now mentally unstable and yeah so I still dont got to my Dads house until X-mas Eve again my Mom tells me to go to my Dads house I fight it at first but then I go. So I spend time with my family then there was so many people there I just got overwhelmed and I wanted to go home me and my Dad had an argument about that to so I got to go home now after the rest of my family yelling at us to stop arguing the police are going to be called I did not give a shit.  I get home and my Dad says to my Sister name see you New Years now that pissed me off a bunch I just yelled at him walking away. So I got to my house and I had my Brotger gifts and he did not get as much as I got or as my Sister. So he broke down hard and felt like no one cared about him over there so this made him even more depressed. So I did not mention this earlier but my family knew my brother was vaping so he spent all of his money on it the he took mine my Sister and my Mom money. My mom got tired of this. ( the money was from sometime of last year to about May 2019) so the protection order is off in Feburary and the first day my Brother sees my Dad he wants to move in this makes people again unhappy. So now I try to going back to focusing on mending mine and my Dads relationship this does not go very well from my Dad not saying happy birthday to me that is small but it still affected me. We had many more disagreements all of them going about nowhere but the relationship was moving forward very slowly I started going over for dinner on some days. But soon it declined yet again I dont remember the reason why but declined. Soon on May 17th an incident with my Mom and my Brother happened leading my brother to go to juvenile detention for a couple of hours. Then on May 19th my Grandpa died this was a very bad timing because I had finals for school in a couple weeks I broke into tears because I felt he was the only person on my Dads side that cared for me but we had his funeral I could not get close to my Grandpa because I would just break into tears(writing this almost made me cry). Soon I went to a consoling appointment with my Dad and that went well we talked a bit more and yeah.  I talked to my Dad a little bit more and I went over to his house for Father's Day I was told to even though I did not want to go it worked out fine. I had another consoling appointment with him soon and my Dad would not treat me like a person and let me talk about my feeling so that made me very unhappy and mad at him. Before we got there I was going to offer to go get breakfast but the the counselor asked my Dad what he was doing after the appointment he said work so I thought he could of done something with me and he put work ahead of me he could of just gone througha drive through somewhere and he was like up there in the status at his work.  No work is more important than his son. A week before the second appointment I said I will come over and spend the night Wednesday I did not do that after he did that though so that's my story so far.\n\nEdit1: It has been a while since I have updated this but so my Dad keeps on going to My Mom and blaming her for my feelings that I get in my head so now he is putting her in the middle causing her to get yelled at for no reason. So I had a whole entire argument with him on July first about getting my mom involved so I have a Job and I worked on 4th of July which is Independence Day for the US and my Dad wanted for me to take it off I did not and I could not. The company policy states that it has to been within two weeks in advanced if you want time off so it was too late. So I had this argument with my dad in text and on the phone about how I was a minor and blah blah blah I really hate that word minor but continuing. My twin sister was not happy that my Dad would not adjust for all of his children and think of everyone else and unlike me my sister has a hard time expressing her feelings so she did not go with my Dad either which I am very proud of her about that. So he did not talk to me next until the 14th asking how my day was I didn't not respond he texted my sister the same thing  she also said nothing. So I told him the 16th that I was not going to talk to him after that argument. He said nothing. Then the most recent thing was July 21st which I found out my Dad is trying to get full custody of my brother which makes everyone unhappy. I also find out that my Dad offered to my sister to come over she said nothing I believe but still he did not address me at all. So I confront him about it and told him not to get my Mom involved so I mention what I just talked about and asking him why he was so mad that Hailey was staying at my Moms house and not mad at both of us and saying she should have as much choice as the rest of his children even my brother because he is still legally a minor. I told him to think if he really wants to have a relationship with me. He eventually texted back back only addressing the minor thing that I was a minor and I had to listen to him. I then asked if he even cared about anything I said he said he did but he still did not address anything else he said he loved us all equally which makes no since because he only asked my sister if she wanted to come over and he is only trying to get full custody of my brother. But that is it for this update.\n\nThank you to who ever took there time to read it!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"FamilyIssues","subreddit_id":"t5_2upyr","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/FamilyIssues","subreddit_subscribers":884,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Me and My Dad are not in a good relationship right now","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FamilyIssues\/comments\/c7mdfy\/me_and_my_dad_are_not_in_a_good_relationship\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

Nothing like the castle at all. It was so...dusty, so barren. With things that looked like it should have been thrown away years ago. The different settings only setting her curiosity off.\n\nThe innkeeper looked fascinated as well, although for completely different reasons; the woman who just walked in was completely naked. Her hair was a mess, and there were clearly strands of white liquid all over her body...had she been raped? She surely didn't look like it, her smile was still wide and seemingly genuine.\n\nHe cleared his throat, still behind the counter of his lobby. \"Miss...can I help you? Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" The princess finally came out of her wondering, looking at the innkeeper with her innocent eyes. It would be rude to shout from across the room, so she closed the distance, giving the innkeeper a good look at her. She somehow looked...familiar to him. \"My apologies, kind sir...\" She said earnestly. \"I am looking for a place to sleep before I continue with my adventure. I was told you might be able to help.\" \"Told...by who?\" The innkeeper asked, raising an eyebrow. \"By these kind men who live out in the alleyway behind this building! They were so nice...they taught me about blowjobs!\" \"And...what do you think a blowjob is?\" \"Oh...it's whenever I meet a man for the first time, I put their cock in my mouth! And then I suck and suck until this white stuff comes out! Sometimes I swallow it, and other times I let it dry all over my body. It feels weird, but...well, I need to blend in! You see...\"\n\nShe leaned in, expecting the innkeeper to also lean in and share this secret. \"I'm actually the princess, the youngest daughter of the King of this land. I'm 19 years old!\" She all of this in a hushed tone, but still loud enough that anyone could hear her. \"I need to find my brother, and I'll take any help I can get...Will you help me, sir?\" He couldn't believe what he was hearing...she was the princess! Well, he wasn't about to let this chance slip. \"Well, I may have a room for you. But...I think you forgot the greeting, princess...\" \"That's right!\" She said, circling the counter and kneeling in front of him.\n\nYou are a beautiful princess, isolated from the rest of the world. Your parents, the king and queen, wanted to protect you from the rest of the world. Not only did they keep you from the outside world, making the castle the only world you've ever known, but they never bothered teaching you about evil. As such, you have absolutely no concept of evil. You are not even aware that people can lie to you, or have ulterior motives.\n\nThey also didn't do much to teach you about sex, leaving you with very minimal knowledge of carnal desires. Even at 18 years old, you don't really know why being naked in public is wrong, and you wouldn't be against doing such a thing if the need ever arose.\n\nYour beloved brother left the castle on business, as he normally does. However, this time he hasn't returned as quickly as usual. It's been 2 months with no word from him. You decide it's time to take matters into your own hands, sneaking out of the castle to find him. How hard could it be? Surely the men outside the castle would be as smart and positive and as helpful as her servants, right? What could possibly go wrong?...\n\nI'd like to find a partner with very few limits to play this naive princess.

I've been really depressed recently and I guess I just need to vent... feel free to move past this. Sometimes it's nice to just scream into the void :\/\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've had depression pretty much since I can remember. I started going to counseling when I was 10. I'm 21 now. At first it was really helpful, I mean, I guess it's still helpful. But in high school I was in a relationship with this guy... I loved him more than I think I've ever loved anyone or anything, you know? And he was really manipulative. He persuaded me into doing a lot of sexual things I told him I didn't want to do. He cheated on me multiple times with multiple girls and told me he would die if I left him. He made me feel like I was the one hurting him for being upset and for trying to defend myself while he spent the last months of our relationship having sex with one of our mutual friends behind my back. He would cut himself and send me pictures of it even though he knew it triggered me. He lied about everything all the time. He made me feel worthless and stupid and made everything even worse by sometimes still acting like he loved me and wanted to be with me. There's even more, so much more that I could write a fucking book, but I can't go over all of it. It hurts too much. And then one day he just. Left. After everything I put myself through to stay with this person I cared about more than anything in the world, one day he just told me he \"didn't like me anymore\" and that we were done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little over two years later, my first year of college, I drunk called him because I missed him so fucking much. That was my bad, I know. I still hate myself for it. He and the girl he left me for had just broken up recently, but were (unbeknownst to me) just on a break and intending to get back together. During this time of us trying to be \"friends\" he encouraged me to sext him and even drove an hour to visit me with the intention of having sex. (We didn't. He backed out.) Then, when the girl found out, he lashed out at me because it was my fault that the girl he loved would never take him back. He told me to never speak to him again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously this shit started when I was 15 and it hasn't fucking left. I still feel worthless. I feel ugly and fat and disgusting and he told me I'm manipulative and a demon. It's hard not to internalize those things. Some of the stuff he said to me rings around in my head every day. I think about him all the time. I've been with my current boyfriend for almost two years now and I absolutely love him but I can't help thinking about my piece of shit ex from high school every fucking day. So then I just feel even worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, there's other problems besides him, too. I gained weight after the breakup and got depressed from that. Last year I lost the weight but this year my doctor changed my depression medication and I gained it back. I'm slowly losing it again (did I mention I have both binge eating disorder and anorexic\/restrictive tendencies? super fun), but I hate my body. I don't feel like myself. It's like I can feel every individual molecule of fat every time I move. I constantly worry about how ugly I look and how everyone is judging me for my weight or my big nose or my stomach or my thighs or the gap in one of my eyebrows. Wearing makeup helps a little but I'm too depressed to do it anymore. Doing makeup requires waking up and I hate waking up in the morning any earlier than I absolutely need to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis whole month I've just felt like shit. I'm hours away from home right now doing a research internship and I'm so lonely. I miss my boyfriend and my family and my rabbit. I don't have the energy to do anything I normally like to do for fun. I have so many books I want to read but I can't make myself pick them up. I just bought Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which I was so excited to get during the summer sale, and I haven't even had the energy to launch it. I'm napping all the time and when I'm not napping I'm lying in bed just... being sad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know. I just feel so ugly and stupid and worthless. I want to go home. But I feel like even when I go home, I'll still want to go home. I just don't know what home is.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"depression","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqqf","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/depression","subreddit_subscribers":525785,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I feel like I'll never be myself again","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/depression\/comments\/c7mgo5\/i_feel_like_ill_never_be_myself_again\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

It's been a year and I feel like I've grown up somewhat but so much pain is still there. I'm learning more about processing my emotions but I feel so broken. I'm reconstructing my identity after all the things my parents put me through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's what I've learned after a year of being away from my abusive parents:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I processed the abuse mentally and ruminated about it a lot. Facing it emotionally is much harder and much more complicated.\n* My mind constantly drifts away to flashbacks, anxiety about the future, and many different things. It's very hard to be in the moment.\n* I dissociate a ton but have learned what it is and am doing a good job in recovering from it so far.\n* My mental age is about 14 if I had to guess. I'm 22 right now. My parents were extreme helicopter parents and sheltered me from the world as much as possible.\n* \\^Some examples of that are basic hygiene habits, how to dress well, insurance, finances, car maintenance, and the experience of working at a job.\n* I am very different than I was a year ago. I've grown a lot, learned a lot, and am more aware of what is going on in my body.\n* I still feel hopeless and terrible and don't know how to open up to people without being completely vulnerable.\n* I feel completely isolated and helpless and broken.\n* I'm done with college and am terrified of what I will do in the future.\n* My dad had a soccer business that he forced me to work at. My friend who sometimes worked there with me told me how stressful and abnormal it was. I worked at that job my whole life and have only had one other job. I had to watch 35 kids, greet customers, handle payments, and close the facility every day while my dad sat on his ass at home and ate chips and watched Netflix. And he had the fucking nerve to tell me that I'd \"never worked a day in my life\" when I was doing his job for him.\n* I feel like I've been cheated out of a real childhood. I have never had a girlfriend although I've gone on many dates. The romantic part of my life is very neglected and full of extreme anxiety.\n* I have extreme PTSD.\n* I am very hyper-vigilant and good at reading people.

If you have had consented to being with many people that is ok, you are doing way better than me and I wish I was that good enough to be able to hook up with women easily or have relationships but I haven't been able to have either of those things. I am a 24 year old guy and I haven't been able to experience a relationship or sex.\n\nThis has just left me so unwilling to be with a woman who has a past. I know its unrealistic to meet a woman who is a virgin but I can never truly trust a woman who has a past and I will never matter to her. I missed out on being anyones first, I missed out on the college experiences, being able to be with someone at the college age, I was never good enough for any of it.\n\nI put myself out there, was fit, went to the gym, dressed well, had friends, went on dates that turned into ghosting, rejection, or most of the time, being treated like crap and used for attention until the guy they wanted showed up in their life. I was a pushover that got walked all over, that is my fault for being so accommodating and available but I didn't deserve to be treated like a joke. I was just not good enough and I definitely don't feel I am enough now even with my college degree and good job.\n\nI missed out on everything I wanted and now my standards have gone up. I wanted to be someone's first sex partner because then I will have meaning to her and someone will remember me even if we don't work out in the end. Someone with a past will be disgusted by my inexperience, I have been told women look down on guys like me, if she found out and she will just lie about how she likes being with me and tell me everything she told other guys before me. She will think about all those other guys, how they are much better, how she misses them, how she enjoyed all those experiences, and I will be there not knowing what other women are like, what being wanted is like.\n\nI will never know what being with someone in college is like, being with someone on holidays, vacations, spending time after class together, being with someone on their birthdays or mine. I went through all of it alone and I am just an empty shell while the person with a past can look back on her past and how much better and fun it was in her prime. I won't ever know what its like to be with a college women, just older women who have a past and are past their prime. No offense to women but everyone has their preferences, I have been rejected for being skinny, because of my race, I think I am allowed to want to first be with college women before moving on to women my age.\n\nBut I wanted to be their age when I am with them and grow older together but here I am now at this age, out of college and now its weird. We have less time to be together and I don't want to be an older guy going for women in college. I have so many standards now because of everything I missed out on and I will never be able to make up for it. All my life up until this day, and definitely not any time soon, my life has been pointless, lonely, a waste. I will never be that guy a woman is crazy about, the one she never forgets, the one she makes reckless decisions with, I am just the responsible, quiet, boring guy women settle for in their 40s. Again I have been told that by a woman I am friends with that knows me really well.\n\nI am not appealing, I am the dorky, loser you see in movies that life throws everything at and suffers until he gets a chance to be with someone late in life. I doubt I will ever meet anyone, based on my post most of you definitely think I have a bad mindset and that is why I am single, regardless no one is dealing with me and never has had to. When things end with me and a girl I leave them alone and remove them off social media since things don't usually go well since I realize I was being lead on so late and I don't want to see them again. \n\nI am so alone despite having friends, I am working on myself and my career but life is so pointless. If I ever do meet anyone, and she will have a past because that is how it goes, I will just casually see her and let her know that of course but if my only chance at sex is with a woman with a past then I don't want to be in a relationship with her. If I never got the experiences I wanted in college, and never got to experience being someone's first sex partner then I don't want to be tied down and give her the satisfaction of being in a relationship so I can miss out on even more of my life. They can blame that on the women who treated me like crap, if I never got what I wanted then I don't want to settle and be with someone who had it all.\n\nLike I said I probably will never be with anyone so the only thing I can do in life is make enough money to take care of myself for the rest of my life. Maybe when I am 40 and have advanced my career enough some woman will be wanting to be with someone as financially stable as me and I can get the satisfaction of knowing she won't have that with me. I wrote all of this but I know it all won't matter in the end, I was never meant to be with anyone and that isn't going to change. I just have to accept that and pretend like my career can make me happy and make me get out of bed every morning for the rest of my life.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"offmychest","subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/offmychest","subreddit_subscribers":1639042,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I cant be with someone who has a past at this point in my life, I missed out on way to much already.","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/offmychest\/comments\/c7mgy9\/i_cant_be_with_someone_who_has_a_past_at_this\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

Some backstory. Hello and stuff. I'm 14, I live in Lagos, Nigeria-not the nicest place to live in to say the very least-and I really like Brawlhalla. I started playing it in the mid or late 2017 months and I first started on PC. Cassidy was on the free rotation at the time and she was my first main. I've got 58 hours on the PC version, 75 on PS4 and 35 hours on the Switch. Most of these hours were generated this year-I didn't play Brawlhalla much in 2017-2018.  \n\n\nSo I've been thinking of this rant for a while. I know it's dumb as hell-'oh my god another guy about to complain about spammers and asking how to improve, who the *fuck* cares'-but honestly I'm getting tired of not having any fun with any game I play anymore. I can't take this anymore. A few days ago I actually sobbed a little at the fact that I'd lost a ranked 1v1 match then I realized how ludicrous that was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rant engaged:**\n\n\\-I never fucking improve: I don't know if it's my ADHD being a bitch, or stupidity, or something else, but I'm not fucking improving for some reason, yet I feel like I must've learnt something. It's been two years; I've learned how to properly cancel, learned some half-decent combos, finally got the hang of gravity-cancelling, and stop Signature-spamming. I still can't do more than last in FFA, still can never win a 1v1, and still can't get past 1200 elo. Yes. I cannot get past what I think is the default elo. I'm currently on 1184. Sometimes I tear my hair out because I still lose to fucking shit like Hattori sig spam and I have to wonder how retarded I am.\n\n\\-Taunts and spam: I love taunts, to be honest. I will never get tired of getting a huge can of salt dumped upon to and fro during the match. Sometimes at the end and the start of the match, everytime I die, any time they got the chance-whatever their frequency, I ended up dying either way, which is nice. I also do love signature spam. Why, you ask? Because I know that I should. I should be joking about how low-tier players always use sig spam and don't know what they are doing, but I'm the guy who, despite everything, loses to them most of the time.\n\n\\-Free for all: Boy, do I fucking love this mode. I always cry whenever going into FFA, because it's laggy as hell. Well, let's be more specific; all my matches are fucking lag-riddled, and ffa is just the worst of it. The main problem is that even with the lag that *everyone in a match experiences, I still lose horrifically.* It's fucking killing me; even when my opponent has THREE other people trying to kill him, I manage to consistently be last place the entire match.\n\n\\-Lag: Brawlhalla is the reason why I keep begging my parents to get me better internet. Because I do not use 25 mbps internet. Or 2.5 mbps. Or 0.25 mbps. My internet is, for the most part, 150 kbps. Kilobytes, yes. I have never had a battle be in 4 bars, ever. 3 bars is a very good day. On most days, it's on 2 fucking bars and I can barely do shit. It's just 'stable' enough for me to keep track, but it will constantly hiccup and it's all really fucking slow. Sometimes the lag has me teleporting to the other half of the stage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere,I think this is enough for me to stop playing this game for a while. A long while. Not because of the game, but because of me, to be perfectly honest, but the reasons are related to the game. Thanks for reading this far, I love you and stuff. Continue being awesome, you out there.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Brawlhalla","subreddit_id":"t5_31c1d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Brawlhalla","subreddit_subscribers":52986,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I'm tired and angry and here's a brawlhalla rant.","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Brawlhalla\/comments\/c7mhb8\/im_tired_and_angry_and_heres_a_brawlhalla_rant\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

The light breeze felt good on my lower body, especially where it matter. I immediately noticed all the eye candy on display as some looked back at me. The golden sand stretched on for a good while but I was able to find a spot soon after undressing.*\n\n*The hot sun shined on my fit, naked body as I took a towel out of my bag and placed it on the sand. I sat down on and looked out to the blue sea that reflected the blazing sun. I looked around briefly, checking out a few guys who I could take on but figured I'd wait for a little while before venturing out to find an ass to play with. I smirked at the thought of it as I checked out the different activities being done. Island exploration, volleyball, wrestling, massage tents, drinking contests. I guess my ex wasn't kidding when he talked about awesome this place was during the summer.*\n\n*Since I had all day I decided to rest for a little while to think about what I'd do first....that is until you came along.*\n\nHey there! How are you doing (well and horny I'm gonna assume, like myself \ud83d\ude09). I'm looking to do a fun and extreme smut based roleplay, with some light story elements in mind. The rp revolves around a nude beach that's different from other beaches, in that it caters exclusively for young guys looking to hook up, have fun and more through different activities or just through the old fashioned way! I arrive and decide to rest for a bit but you notice me and come over offering an invitation that I'm definitely not gonna turn down \ud83d\ude1c.\n\nA little about myself, my name's Josh, I'm 20 years old, I'm a top and from Ireland (my timezone is GMT+1). I'm looking for a confident bottom that has experience being one and also knows how to roleplay. I'm not looking for timid or meek bottoms who just wanna call me daddy as a pet name (I love pet names but I'm also 20 remember \ud83d\ude02). I'm also not looking for straight guys who are curious \"what it feels like\" because I'm not doing this to teach guys what text based gay sex is like haha. I'm also only looking for guys between the ages of 18-24 since it feels better to have a partner that's around the my age range. Sorry if that's a problem for some older guys but I'm sure you'll find an equally fun roleplay too \ud83d\ude0a.\u00a0 love confidence and feeling like there's an equal footing in our conversations so it doesn't feel one sided. However if you like being a slut then I won't object even slightly haha.\n\nKinks wise I'm totally limitless aside from a few obvious fetishes (Scat, piss, vomit, gore, rape, vore, slave + master kink, pedophilia, crossdressing, straight turned\/forced gay)\n\nMy kinks include (take note lol): i have a pretty big foot fetish, twinks, femboys (not too feminine though), furries, anthros, sluts, threesomes, rough sex, cum stuffing, cum shots, outdoors, oral, light bondage, ass play, flexibility or body contortion, excessive cum, teasing, details, flirting\/dirty talk, kissing licking, biting, scratching, hair pulling, raceplay, romance, oil play, using porn pics + links, wet sex, confidence, showers, romance, descriptive, details, long srps and clothing. My MAIN KINKS would be the foot fetish, twinks, romance, sluts, dirty talk and flexibility. It'd be worth noting that if you can play two or more guys in the roleplay thats amazing but its totally not required, just nice to have an extra hole to play with \ud83d\ude09.\n\nI also have a bunch of refs as well so if you're stuck looking for one then I can provide some for your to choose. I personally prefer real life pics (not of us by the way, unless you're a real twink \ud83d\ude09) but animated is fine\n\nI really hope you're interested in my rp. If so then message me on kik at TheosK1 or DM me on reddit and we can discuss the details.\u00a0 I know I'm probably asking a lot but I can guarantee we'll have a lot of fun with it. If you have any ideas you wanna bring in or questions regarding the rp then definitely bring them since you're pleasure is just as important to me as my own \ud83d\ude0a. \n\nNOTE: When you message me please include your name (or character name), age, kinks and limits. I'm not expecting an essay, just a few things to let me know what you're into, not into and how old you are. I've been getting a few messages with just \"hey\" and it's a little frustrating since what I'm asking for isn't remotely difficult to answer so please keep that in mind. It won't stop me from messaging back but it'll leave a poor first impression.\nThanks! \ud83d\ude18\n\nP.S. If you had to pick a flavour for cum, what would it be?

I've worked at an advertising\/marketing agency for two years as an account manager. Basically, I cater to clients, respond to complaints they have, try to get them to resign their contracts, and deliver them breakfasts or lunches or throw events for them....whatever. However, because of a desire to get away from my life here and all the stuff with my dad and my history, I am moving to another state next week, and Friday was my last day.\n\nFor the last year or so, I've had an account where the client is 39, goes-to-the-gym-all-the-time built, has pretty eyes and a nice manner, and is much bigger than me, well over 6' tall (I'm 5'4). He's also separated from his wife. At times, during work, he might say, \"Hey there, hot stuff,\" or he would call, I would answer, and he'd immediately say, \"when will you go out with me?\" He would eye fuck me at events and occasionally would maybe put his hand on my back or brush my hair from my face. He never pressured me and wasn't creepy, but there was a real tension. I won't lie, I've had a big crush on him. But both of us didn't want to lose our job.\n\nFriday was hard, and there were things all day for my last day. Breakfast at the office. A lunch with a bunch of friends at work. Gifts. And a happy hour with some clients and people from work. Around midday I got a text from him asking what time the happy hour started. I told him. His next text said, \"What time does your employment end?\" He was asking because he was going to shoot his shot. At least I thought he might. Now, with all the stuff with my dad and moving, I've been trying to not be a giant slut...just trying to restart my life. So when he sent the message, I kind of though, \"Ugh....what am I going to do....I don't want this...but I do....but ugh....I don't.....but maybe....ugh!!!\" I went to happy hour not really knowing what would happen or what I'd do...my plan was to play it by ear.\n\nIt's hot where I am (over 100 degrees) and so I was wearing a white denim skirt with a pink and white, horizontal striped, sleeveless top with my hair down, a single barrette holding it out of my eyes and king of behind my ear on one side. I actually added the barrette because one time my client, Jay, had casually mentioned he thought it was a cute look. So yeah, I sorta played into things with him.\n\nHe got there and there were maybe fifteen people there and when he did, everyone sort of did the thing where they move around and pull up a chair to let him sit down and the two girls to my left made it a point to sit him by me. He put his arm around me and hugged me and asked how I was and said he'd miss seeing me. The girls joked. \"Yeah, I'll be you will,\" they said, and laughed. I don't think I'm stunning, but these girls are always commenting that I'm the \"cute office girl\" or whatever, and I only say this to sort of give a feel of their attitude toward me. But moving on. \n\nJay ordered drinks and he got a round for several of us. I was drinking chocolate martinis that tasted far too much like a milkshake, so I probably had too many too fast. Regardless, people sort of said goodbyes and left. A couple girls teared up. It was all sweet. A couple times, I felt Jay rubbing my back or shoulder lightly as I sort of cried and told my friends goodbye. On one occasion, he said something funny and I reached over and grabbed his hand below the table and in doing so, pulled it over to my thigh. I wanted to just feel him feel me a bit....just to test things, more to see how I felt than anything....was I going to do anything? Moments later, I went to the restroom and on the way back, he was standing at the bar and I went over and leaned against it next to him as he ordered some drinks. \n\n\"I'm going to miss you,\" I told him. \n\n\"Well you don't leave until next weekend. You should come see me before then,\" he said. \n\n\"I'd like that,\" I said, being coy. \"But I'm not your account rep anymore.\" \n\n\"I wish you never were,\" he said, winking. I kind of melted right then, but still didn't know what I'd do. I was nervous and didn't really know why....perhaps I just liked him more than I do most guys who I simply don't have feelings for, and I don't know why I have them for him. I did know if I did anything with him, it would just be a hookup and I wouldn't even be in this city ten days from now. \n\nWe went back to the table and continued to flirt a bit. He would touch my thighs more and it was clear we were sort of hitting it off to the last two people there - another girl that's an account manager and a guy from our administrative office. As it got dark, I reached for my phone and just texted him because I didn't have any way to make plans in front of the others.\n\n\"Can you take me home?\" I texted. He just sort of looked at me and gave a bit of a nod that I thought only I could detect. The others peeled away after the round of drinks they were on and the girl hugged me and asked if I needed a ride. Ugh....now I had to lie. I told her I had an Uber on the way. The guy left, and it was just Jay and I.\n\n\"So......\" he said. \"Take you home?\" He sort of grinned. I blushed.\n\n\"Stop,\" I said. \"I don't usually do anything like that,\" I lied, and also felt bad. Any time I'm with a guy I really like, I get ashamed of my history. \n\n\"Like what?\" He asked. \n\n\"Nothing,\" I squeaked. \"Will you be good to me?\" I asked, sort of opening up a bit. If this was going to happen, I didn't want to be hurt. I've been hurt and just wanted to avoid it if I could and I thought he was a nice guy. He leaned in and pushed the other side of my hair back and kissed me. I pushed into him and sunk into the kiss and it was great. \"Of course,\" he said pulling away, leaving me breathless. I just took his hand, grabbed my purse, and walked out front, where he put me in his truck and we went to my place.\n\n(*********)\n\nWe got inside and I told him to pick a bottle of wine while I put my things away and went to the restroom. I checked my hair and makeup and calmed my nerves. I came back out and he handed me a glass. I took a sip and put it down, then took his glass and sat it down and I kissed him. Deep and wet and nice, and I lifted myself to wrap my legs around him, feeling his hand on my ass, holding me as we made out. I kicked off my shoes and pulled away. I pointed down the hall. \"Let's go in there,\" I said and he carried me to my room.\n\nOnce there, he sat me on the bed and climbed next to me. I rolled over him and we kept making out and his hands ran over my hips and my side and in a moment, I reached down and undid the button on my skirt, then kissed him again as his hand slid low on my stomach and his fingers teased under my panties. I moaned as they ran over my slit for the first time, which I had conveniently shaved that day because I had suspected I might hook up with someone. He started fingering me and kissing my neck, then pulled away long enough to ask if I had any condoms. I did. But I told him something else.\n\n\"You don't have to use them if you don't want,\" I said, sort of lying there looking up at him. \n\n\"Are....you sure?\" He asked. \"I mean....I don't want to have a kid or....something.\" He was trying to be polite....it was just awkward, I think. \n\n\"I promise you don't have to worry about it,\" I told him. I wanted to feel him inside me, unimpeded. He sort of snarled and kissed me. I heard him undoing his belt and in a second I helped, before opening his pants and reaching into his briefs and stroking him. His cock was NICE. It was probably just above average, good thickness, and easily got super hard, which is not always given. We made out as we stroked each other for a moment before I told him to lay back. I peeled off my top and my bra and straddled him. He felt my breasts and told me he'd wanted to see me naked as long as he's worked with me. \n\n\"Oh yeah?\" I asked. \"How long have you wanted to fuck me?\" I opened his shirt and nibbled down his chest, not even caring if he answered. I pulled his pants down a bit and wrapped my lips around his cock. I started sucking him only for a few moments before pulling off and moving up to kiss him again. He put me on my back, undressed me and threw his clothes completely off. He told me I was \"so fucking beautiful\" just before climbing onto me and sliding his cock in my pussy. \n\nOH MY GOD. He had a nice curve upward and the second he entered me, he started hitting an amazing spot inside me and I was wailing like a crazy person. He fucked me steady, not hard, and we both moaned our way through a nice, firm fuck. The buildup had us both aching, and it didn't last long before I had a tiny quiver, close to an orgasm, and he filled me up. We laid there catching our breath before sort of snuggling and chatting. I told him I wished we could have hooked up sooner. He told me I was amazing and he was going to miss seeing me each week. \n\nAfter a while, I rolled into him and let him kiss me and stroked him hard again. He pulled my thigh over him and I lowered myself, sliding him into me again. He kept hitting me perfectly as I rolled my hips faster and faster and before I knew it, I had gushed all over his cock and his hips, making a complete mess of my sheets. I collapsed on him, burying my face in his neck and he sort of laughed and lightly patted and rubbed my ass, then rubbed my hips. \n\n\"You okay princess?\" He asked.\n\n\"Yesss,\" I gave a muffled moan. \n\n\"Can I get you from behind?\" He asked.\n\n\"Yesss,\" I moaned again, and he laughed. I lifted from him and got on all fours facing my mirror and watched as he climbed over me from behind. He lightly tugged my hair and arched me. \n\n\"Look at me,\" he said, and I did, in the mirror, and he shoved steadily into me. My forehead wrinkled and my nose curled...it was a tight fit and felt amazing all at once. In moments he was fucking me faster, but still not up to what I'm used to. \n\n\"Harder,\" I said. \"Harder please,\" I said in my best little girl voice. He went harder. \"Harder,\" I said again. \n\n\"You sure?\" He asked. I just stretched my arms out and put my face in my comforter. He fucked me for a good maybe ten minutes and then I reached low and pinched my fingers lightly along his cock and rubbed his balls until he came inside me again, collapsing on top of me. We rested again.\n\n\"You can be rough with me,\" I told him, asking as much as telling. \"I won't break.\" He kissed me. He told me he liked rough sex but didn't know if I did or what my history with it was so he didn't really go for it. \"I'll tell you if you cross any lines,\" I told him. He hadn't yet. We napped for a bit and then I woke up and he was asleep. I stroked him again, my nails lightly teasing him, and he woke up. I kissed him. \"I want you to fuck me hard,\" I said. He asked if I was sure. I said \"Yeah.\" He pushed me onto my stomach and fucked me prone, going hard and fast right away, pulling my hair and arching my back. He pounded me HARD and it was amazing, but after two times, I couldn't cum. He pulled me to my back and climbed to my face, where he fucked my mouth a while, but finally pulled away and collapsed by me. \n\n\"I can't cum a third time,\" he said. I kissed his neck and curled into him and we cuddled. Around 3-4 am, he got up and said he had to go because he had to work the next day. I was a bit disappointed but he asked if I wanted to have brunch on Sunday. I eagerly agreed, threw on a tee shirt, and got a nice kiss when I walked him out.\n\nFast forward to today. He texted this morning and said to bring a swimsuit, so I did, and I met him at 10:30 at a nice outdoor place and we had a nice breakfast. We chatted a bit and had a nice time and neither of us really discussed the fact that I'm moving...we just had a nice time. I asked why I needed a swimsuit and he goes, \"I thought you might want to come hang out at my pool...if you want to.\" I'm unemployed and have no place to be and liked him. Of course I did!\n\nWe paid the tab and I followed him to his and once there, he pulled me in for a nice kiss, pointed me to the deck where I could change, and I headed that way as he swatted my ass. I gave him a smirk and said, \"Couldn't wait, huh?\" He just asked if I wanted some wine. I nodded and went to change from my khaki shorts and dress tee shirt into a green and white bikini with pink piping and strings. I barefooted it to the pool and Jay pulls me in for another kiss. He handed me a glass of moscato and I tasted it, then let him taste it off my lips with another kiss. I sat my glass down and waded into the pool and he jumped in and swam to where I was. I wrapped my legs around him and we sort of floated around and kissed under the sun. He played with my pussy a little bit and fingered me slowly until I had a mini orgasm. He grinned at me and I blushed, then kissed him and pulled away...even though I was in the water, I felt like I needed to clean up a little. I got out of the pool, toweled off, ran inside, freshened up and returned. I laid out and tanned and he played music and hung out with me. We played in the pool a bit more, splashing around and just being like kids, then laid out more until we were dry. I straddled him and we made out. \n\n\"Take me inside,\" I said. \n\n\"What's inside?\" He asked.\n\n\"Just take me inside,\" I said, playing like I was annoyed.\n\n\"Why?\" He asked, teasing me, his hands on my ass. I kissed the side of his mouth.\n\n\"You know why,\" I said.\n\n\"Say it,\" he grinned.\n\n\"So you can fuck meeeee,\" I sort of growled in a low almost whisper. He spanked my ass hard and told me to get up. I took his hand and walked him inside. Once there, he pushed me onto a couch and spread me open, kneeling down and eating my pussy as he pushed my bikini aside. He licked and ate me until I was wet and I told him I wanted him to be rough with me. He knelt on the couch and slammed into me and just railed me. He bruised my hips grabbing me so hard and just hitting me deep and at that amazing angle. I told him I wanted him to cum in my mouth and he did. I swallowed and he kissed me, which I love that a guy will do that. He then fingered me and rubbed my clit until I came and we collapsed on the couch. We stayed there and turned on the television for a while and after maybe forty five minutes, I straddled him as he sat up and I rode him hard. This time, it was all me doing the work as he slapped my ass and pulled my hair and bit my nipples. \n\n\"Take that cock bitch,\" he'd say, but you could tell he didn't mean it. Friday night, he called me a slut and it was the same thing...he wasn't great at dirty talk. But take it, I did and I rode him through an orgasm and then a second mini one, before I let him lift me slightly and fuck me hard, pounding up into me for only a few moments before he erupted inside me a final time. \n\nThe rest of the day, we hopped in the pool and cooled off once more, sort of lounged with some wine, and talked. A lot. I loved that. He told me he hoped I'd let him visit my new city. I sort of said, yeah, yeah....whatever. He said he liked me. I sort of said, yeah, yeah....whatever, again. But I told him I hoped I saw him again before I leave. We don't have plans, but I'll bet we hang out again. He made me a sandwich after we had sex that second time and we parted when I felt I was overstaying my welcome...I don't want to be clingy and I don't even know just how I feel, if this guy is relationship material or just a hookup, even though I know we will soon be in different places.

I tried posting this yesterday but it was deleted because of the title.\n\nI've been with my soon to be hubby for 3 years. I was 19 and he was 28 when we started dating. We had an amazing relationship physically and emotionally until he gained a significant amount of weight. And I mean SIGNIFICANT. He was never the skinniest guy. I would have called him thick since he was lifting a few times a week back then. Hes 6'4, and I'm 5'2 at a whopping 105 lbs...hence my name. But I would say since he packed on more than just a few lbs. Hes suddenly up to 380 lbs. Hes gained 150 lbs since we started dating and I'm a little worried because we are starting to have problems, mostly sexually, but its spilling onto other aspects of our relationship.\n\nFirst off, hes too heavy. We tried other positions but his big stomach gets in the way in most positions. I basically disappear and am completely crushed by him when in missionary position. Like my face gets stuffed by his big chest (which is now bigger than mine) and I cant breathe. We tried doing it from behind but his stomach hurts my back and once it nearly fractured my rib. The only way for him to get anyplace pleasure sexually is if he pounces on me when hes on too. But you can't imagine what that does to me having a 380 lb person basically slamming his whole body on me. It really hurts.\n\nCowgirl seems to be the best option but even then all I see in front of me is his stomach. No matter what position, his stomach is just there and either crushing me or blocking me. \n\nWe tried 69 the other day while on our sides and due to his big size I couldnt even reach his penis. So I went on top and it was still an issue. So we tried him on top and that of course did not work (hes 275 lbs heavier than me)\n\nThe only new technique we started doing is nipple play. Because hes bigger, his chest is more sensitive and kissing and nibbling his big chest and nipples really gets him turned on. Sometimes when we are cuddling I'll pick at them or nibble them and we get to business...orntry to at least. Weve never tried that on him (only on me which I like). I'm ok with it, but I didnt think guys liked that as much as girls. What's a little embarrassing about it is that his friends joked in front of me about his weight, and one asked \"So who sucks who's titties?\" Clearly they were making fun of his weight, and his chest which is bigger than mine now, but for that speculation to actually be the truth... its embarassing for him. \n\nI really love him. Even to this day he treats me like a queen and the only woman in his life. That's why I have no shame in trying to please him sexually, even if it almost breaks me in half or suffocates me. I don't want to be that person and dump him because of his weight. Im still attracted to him somehowHes still very handsome and I know we can get past this. But hes over 30 now and his metabolism has slowed down. And his health also has killed his sex drive. I have to literally act like like a porn star just to get him excited. Im constantly harassed by people about the fact that hes so much bigger than I am, we don't even look like a couple. As I mentioned, we are also engaged and one day I want to have kids. \n\nEdit: He avoids talking about it. He once mentioned he wanted to be near 300 lbs (with muscle of course) since he's tall, but this isn't what I imagined. I wouldn't mind if he was overweight at 275 or 300lbs, I kind of like the feeling of being crushed but I was also able to handle him at that weight...  not nearly 400 lbs.\n\nWhat can I do? Are there any positions that might work?\n\nTL DR: My fiance is 275 lbs heavier than me. He crushes me during sex. I still love him.\n\nBy the way for those wondering..I met him when I was 17. I was nothing more than an acquaintance to him at the time but I thought he was really handsome. We started talking when I was 18 but he avoided to try anything until I turned 19, when we both thought was the right time. He did not manipulate me or anything.\n\nHe lost his job a few years ago and was unemployed for a while and his confidence was low so that's where I think this all started. He has a job now and he travels a lot for work now and he tells me he has to eat out a lot.","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey reddit!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I just made this account because I have a situation I cant seem to overcome and I need some input, or advice.

To be excited to see you've messaged. To share the ins and outs of our days or to talk about whatever is on our minds. Give a different perspective on situations or to bounce ideas off of. Anything really. I am married and not looking to change that for you or me. But I travel for work, and moved to a new town a few years ago. I haven't been able to find any new friends since I'm not home very often. The only people I talk to are the guys I work with and my wife, who has lots of friends and other things going on, and it just kinda feels like there's not much time left for me.

I work a demanding manual labor job, but being on the road tends to lead to a lot of fast food. Something I'm consciously trying to change. I'm a bit of an introvert till I get to know someone, but then I open up just fine. I love being outdoors. kayaking, fishing, hiking\/camping, etc. I don't watch much TV or play video games with the exception of Youtube and sometimes watching twitch streamers. But i love learning and trying new things. \n\n   What I'm looking for: online relationship at least for now. Who knows what the future holds. Would like to find someone long term.

I could just be blowing it out of proportion, but I don't really tell anyone I know about any of my problems. Only reason I'm writing shit out here is because no one really knows me. I'm pretty much an average white teenager. I'm 15. I'll just go down a quick list of shit in my life real quick. Ive seen two people murdered outside my house. I've witnessed my dad OD twice, one of which got us in a car accident. I've been in foster care twice. I've been in fights. I've never touched drugs tho since I saw how my dad was. I was homeless for a few weeks. I've had my moms friends who are drug addicts stealing my shit. My mom had a crazy skinhead boyfriend (Think American History X). He was a racist, crazy, and hit my mom when he was drunk. I'll give him credit for actually caring about me. But when he got drunk at hurt my mom I got incredibly angry. I kicked him down a large set of stairs once and held a knife to him for hitting my mom. Anyway I've cut my arms before, been there, done that. I've thought about suicide, but I'm too squeamish for any other option besides Carbon Monoxide. I went to therapy for awhile, but decided to end it by convincing my mom and therapist I was all better. I've studied as much as I can about psychological damage and the whole cycle of abuse. Ive never taken drugs. But I've done shitty things to other people in pursuit of my own happiness. I was dating this girl, and it was primarily a LDR. I had an opportunity to have sex w a cute girl. I thought to myself \"Wouldnt that help my life out a little?\" Turns out sex doesnt work, like any other drug. I also couldn't keep talking to my girlfriend after what I had done behind her back, so I told her the truth, and she didn't get mad, instead she got a little anxious. But we're still friends, and that's all I care about. I regret what I did to her, everyday. I always try and help people w their problems, always. But its like when I have a problem people turn a blind eye. The only person that wouldnt really was my ex, that I cheated on, so go figure. Ive also had instances where I'll pick on people for random things, like attack their insecurities, if I feel like theyre a threat. I pick on one kid alot, but in reality, he's one of my best friends. I think he knows I don't mean alot of what I say to him, but I'm still worried. Like is that how I'm gonna be to my wife, or kids!?  Ive thought about and think about suicide everyday, and I've been diagnosed w manic depression. I dont think I'll ever commit suicide, but its always in my mind, like a clock ticking. I think I'll explode one day, like a fiery mess. But I dont want to hurt anyone. I'm genuinely scared of becoming that, and I've tried to accept I have a problem.
