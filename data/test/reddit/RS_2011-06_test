He sent me a message that said \"How do you feel about string theory?\" (taking clues from my profile) and I was hooked. Our first date was a smash hit, and we've been pretty inseparable ever since. I spent 5-6 nights a week at his house. \n\nThe Pros: \n\n1. We have the most amazing, intelligent conversations. I can't talk about quantum foam with anybody else in my life.\n2. We make each other laugh until it hurts.\n3. The sex is the best I have ever had. We are adventurous and passionate. \n4. We go on road trips frequently. I can be stuck in the car with him for 12 hours straight and never stop smiling.\n5. He makes me happy. Like, deliriously happy.\n\nThe Cons:\n\n1. When we first started dating (we \"dated\" for 6 weeks before we became exclusive) he was still seeing his Ex. The last time he slept with her was after our second date. He told me about the situation, that they had dated for 6 months, she broke up with him, and they continued being fuck buddies for a year.  I accidentally picked up his phone one day (we have the same phone) and it was a text from his ex that said \"K.\" It was in response to a text he sent her that said, \"I miss you. I miss us. I miss what we had.\" Now, I can't stop looking. He has sent her a few more texts and she finally unfriended him on Facebook two months ago. \n\n2. I told him I love him 7 weeks ago. I didn't expect to hear it back immediately, because he's \"been hurt before\" and \"is afraid of love\" and yadda yadda bullshit. He still hasn't said it. Last week, we were laying in bed cuddling and he says, \"I love lamp.\" I laughed, because it was funny, I guess. He's said it a few more times, and now I feel like it's just kind of rude. He knows I'm waiting to hear the L word back and it's like he's rubbing it in my face.\n\n3. He is still on fucking OKCupid. I disabled my profile before we were even official, but that was my choice. After we had been monogamous for a month, I finally asked him why he hadn't changed his status on OKC to Seeing Someone. A few weeks later, he finally did. Now, he's \"Seeing Someone,\" but he is also browsing through girls nearly every fucking night. He hasn't contacted any of them and hasn't gotten any messages, but the fact that he's even looking just shows me that he's not in this. \n\n4. He has no coping skills. We have had a couple major fights over petty bullshit, because he gets hungry (I know. I know.) and turns into a 5 year old. God forbid we can't figure out what to do for dinner, he will throw a tantrum, walk out of a restaurant/grocery store, ignore me and then finally ask me to go home because he wants to \"isolate.\" Things are better now that we're more aware of what's causing the attitude change and I carry granola bars, but he's not doing anything to actually learn how to work/talk through a problem. He just shuts down any time I try to talk about an issue, no matter how serious. \n\n5. He doesn't really go out of his way to do/say nice things. I am the biggest fucking ego boost for him. I have seen such a change in him since we started dating, he's confident and cocky and I guess I've created a monster by constantly telling him how smart/funny/sexy/silly/gifted sexually he is. On the other hand, he doesn't ever compliment me. He has never bought me a card/flowers/chocolates. For Valentine's day, he bought me a case of Cherry 7-Up. \n\n\nMost of me thinks that he is with me because I'm convenient, I'm good for his ego, the sex is incredible and I'm interesting, not because he sees a future. But if it was just this, I don't feel like we would be linked up on Facebook, I wouldn't have met all his family (in and out of state), he wouldn't have taken me to his dad's grave, we wouldn't be making plans for hotel reservations for next spring. He talks about growing old together, getting married, has named our future children, and it seems kind of fucking sincere--but I just don't buy it. He has pretty much ZERO relationship experience (was a forever alone, his first girlfriend was The Ex at 31 years old) and I feel like I give him a lot of leeway because he doesn't really know how to act in a relationship. He has told me that he wouldn't be with me if he couldn't picture himself falling in love with me, and that there isn't a very large discrepancy in how we feel about each other. \n\nI have found myself almost breaking it off with him a few times (coincidentally, every time I get my period, ~every 6 weeks) but he always fights so hard to stay together. I always give in because that's my biggest issue, I want to know he cares.\n\n**Do I walk away?** Part of me is very, very stubborn and can't end things because in my mind, that would be admitting defeat. We *should* be so fucking perfect together. But that's not realistic.\n\n\nHoly shit that was really long, I'm sorry. **TL;DR: Boyfriend of 6 months' actions don't match his words. He waxes poetic (and not in a get-laid way, because future-talk freaks me out) about the rest of our life together, but is still browsing OKCupid for strange.** \n\n*P.S.-- I'm retardedly happy with our relationship as long as I'm not on shark week.

Seems like I should be giving as much info as possible in terms of diet and exercise, so my post turned out kinda long. \n\nSo I've been working on losing weight for the past couple months and have been largely successful, I'm 5'9\" male down from 190 to 158. From about 22% BF to about 12%. So now I decided to bulk up before cutting down that last little bit of fat (goal is to get to 8-9% BF or look lean and sexy whichever comes first) \n\nThe issue is I am trying to bulk up now, and am seeing/feeling more muscle as well as more fat, this was expected. The issue I'm having is that my weight is staying the same. (Dropped one pound) How is this possible am I losing muscle from parts of my body I'm not noticing? (legs, back, chest, shoulders and arms all seem to be the same or bigger). My love handles may have shrunk a little but I think the added muscle and fat would compensate. \n\nTo get bigger I have increased my caloric intake mostly with carbs, good fats (Eggs, peanut butter) and protein. started SL 5x5 last week but have varied quite a bit from it (I know I shouldn't but have learned to love spending time in the gym and don't want to leave). I find myself to be adding in a couple more exercises such as bicep curls and bench press every day I work out. (3 times a week) Plus a lot of core exercises. Additionally I play soccer Monday nights and jog about 15 minutes every other day as my reduced cardio routine so I can still keep my stamina up. Generally I take one weekend day off and don't do anything. \n\nMy first meal is usually a banana and a glass of milk around 11am or a Peanut butter sandwich on wheat bread on my way to school. Then around 2-3 Ill have eggs and sometimes ground beef. Then a medium sized dinner and maybe a snack of nuts.Then I work out at night, come home drink a protein shake and have a snack of peanut butter plain and some nuts.

Seems like I should be giving as much info as possible in terms of diet and exercise, so my post turned out kinda long. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been working on losing weight for the past couple months and have been largely successful, I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;9&amp;quot; male down from 190 to 158. From about 22% BF to about 12%. So now I decided to bulk up before cutting down that last little bit of fat (goal is to get to 8-9% BF or look lean and sexy whichever comes first) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue is I am trying to bulk up now, and am seeing/feeling more muscle as well as more fat, this was expected. The issue I&amp;#39;m having is that my weight is staying the same. (Dropped one pound) How is this possible am I losing muscle from parts of my body I&amp;#39;m not noticing? (legs, back, chest, shoulders and arms all seem to be the same or bigger). My love handles may have shrunk a little but I think the added muscle and fat would compensate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get bigger I have increased my caloric intake mostly with carbs, good fats (Eggs, peanut butter) and protein. started SL 5x5 last week but have varied quite a bit from it (I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t but have learned to love spending time in the gym and don&amp;#39;t want to leave). I find myself to be adding in a couple more exercises such as bicep curls and bench press every day I work out. (3 times a week) Plus a lot of core exercises. Additionally I play soccer Monday nights and jog about 15 minutes every other day as my reduced cardio routine so I can still keep my stamina up. Generally I take one weekend day off and don&amp;#39;t do anything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first meal is usually a banana and a glass of milk around 11am or a Peanut butter sandwich on wheat bread on my way to school. Then around 2-3 Ill have eggs and sometimes ground beef. Then a medium sized dinner and maybe a snack of nuts.Then I work out at night, come home drink a protein shake and have a snack of peanut butter plain and some nuts. Throughout the day I&amp;#39;ll drink about 3-4 glasses of 2% milk, 2 of them in protein shakes and also 80 - 100oz of water. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is causing this added fat and bulk but keeping my weight the same?

I took this as a safety job after being laid off and moving into my parents basement. My mother has been working here for over 20 years, and I've also worked summers here regularly since I was 14.  \n\nWell a year before I started, the department I work in came under new management.  We'll call her E. E changed everything.  I would get a steady yearly one dollar raise every year I'd come back as a teenager, but since she took over, my wages have stagnated at $10 per hour, which doesn't even afford me the ability to maintain two college classes at once, no less afford my own apartment.  I'm not allow to work more than 60 hours.  My mother is no longer allowed to acquire overtime, resulting in a major $6,000+ reduction in her already mediocre yearly salary.  My family has always struggled, but her overtime afforded us little things like a vacation every other year.  Now she is noticeably depressed, but tries to hide it.\n\nI have several major issues:\n\n* I was moved from my regular desk which was spruced up and made important-looking for E's daughter who joined the company out of nowhere...with a salary on par with my mom's (yet no family of 6 to care for like my mom).  Then I was moved to a desk behind my mother, and E sits literally facing my left side.  I have eyes monitoring me work every. single. day.  So I don't surf the web, I don't chat, I don't goof off.  I literally work for hours straight, while everyone not in the same position can do all of that, waste time, and then some. Including E, my boss.\n\n* I'm in no position to complain about nepotism, but the degree of it in upper management has become ridiculous.  E's daughter was hired into the company as a manager, highly outranking my mother (who is technically a secretary but does the work of at least 5 people), with no relevant work experience or qualifications.  She has recently been able to purchase a seven bedroom house (with E's help), while I can't afford to live on my own.  The owner of the company hired both his sons as high ranking managers. One of them comes in and actually works, if only for 3 hours a day.  The other I have never seen in the building at all, though I know he recieves two checks for \"work\", one rent check and one salary check every two weeks.  E herself takes a vacation every month, complete with bragging rights.  My mother and I work hard and yet we will never know the life of luxury that these people can afford for, from what we can tell, doing the bare minimum.\n\n* They give no one of \"importance\" any incentive to care about the quality of their work.  No one except upper management has been given a raise in 5 years, they eliminated overtime, and cut hours left and right.  For example, I'm trying to finish school and move into my own apt.  YET, I'm not allowed to make more than $10 an hour, not allowed to work more than 60 hours (30 hours per week, on a biweekly payroll), and am still expected get my heavy daily workload done on time to save the company money.  I'm literally trapped.  Not to mention, there is never any praise for a job well done, but ALWAYS a heavy reprimand for any little infraction.  E even has a tendency to yell at me for nothing, or for things I have no control over, simply to fulfill her momentary whim to yell.\n\n* After 20 years with this company, my mom deserves a lot more respect than she gets.  Ever since E and her kid started working here, the ethnic jokes about her being Chinese and having a slight accent have gotten out of control.  I don't remember anyone ever treating her this way this frequently.  It hurts me to see, especially since she won't defend herself, and even goes along with the joke even though I can tell it upsets her.  These things are said openly, in front of the owner of the company, who doesn't seem to notice or care.  They treat her like she's an idiot because she has an accent.  This is one of the situations that infuriate me the most.\n\n* It's clear I have no worth in this company, and it breaks me down a little every day.  It's compounded by the fact that I see it wearing down my mother as well, but she's even more trapped by this job than I am.\n\n* When this first started, I became very depressed and self mutilated whenever I felt pressured or attacked, which is pretty regularly.  I got my anti-depressant dosage increased and I made dramatic improvements, maintaining this for nearly a year.  However, lately, I've been spending my work days pondering ways to kill myself without my family finding out.  Elaborate fantasies about driving 6 states over and having an \"accident\".  Even more recently are my cravings to cut again.  \n\nThis job isn't good for me, but I need money to continue my education and have been unable to secure even an interview at another job, despite the fact that I've been looking for months.  Even if I got a new job, I'd feel terrible about leaving my mother in that environment.  I'm falling into a heavier depression than ever, and I really feel like my job is driving me to suicide.  I'm 25 years old, I'm anxious to get my adulthood on track and I'm just failing at every turn.  My spirit is broken.  I just can't find a way out of this vicious cycle.

I don't know why. I've never had much of a work ethic but this downward trend doesn't make any sense. The only thing I can think of is my clinical depression. I've lost all motivation and I no longer even have the desire to live.

I had become a smoker in the meantime, and while definitely not overweight, I was \"softer\" than I usually like to be. Soon enough, I had quit smoking and within a month and a half was running 2-2.5 miles (up/down hills/treadmill) about 4 days a week and lifting weights 2 or 3 of those days as well. Needless to say, I was feeling great, my mood had completely lifted and I was starting to see great results. Then my legs decided to suck. \n\nAfter 2 months, my legs were riddled with pain. While my right knee (previously dislocated) always hurts, I had other shooting pains through my shins. I thought it might be shin splits, but I am still unsure. The pain was so bad I couldn't run anymore and about a month ago, I decided to take time off. The pain lingered for a few weeks and unfortunately I have fallen back into my old habits of smoking and heavy drinking. \n\nI need to get back into shape, and I really like the routine I had going, but I can't deal with that pain again. I'm not being a wuss, I'm 24, I was a top Swimmer and played Football all through High School so I'm used to pushing myself. I also know that i didn't throw too much too fast at my legs. I started running slowly and only twice a week for a month. I tried to build strength carefully, but I guess it didn't work. \n\nHelp requested is 2-fold\n \n1. What the hell is wrong with my legs? Is it the distance, surface (asphault/treadmill), pace?.....\n\n2.

I had become a smoker in the meantime, and while definitely not overweight, I was &amp;quot;softer&amp;quot; than I usually like to be. Soon enough, I had quit smoking and within a month and a half was running 2-2.5 miles (up/down hills/treadmill) about 4 days a week and lifting weights 2 or 3 of those days as well. Needless to say, I was feeling great, my mood had completely lifted and I was starting to see great results. Then my legs decided to suck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After 2 months, my legs were riddled with pain. While my right knee (previously dislocated) always hurts, I had other shooting pains through my shins. I thought it might be shin splits, but I am still unsure. The pain was so bad I couldn&amp;#39;t run anymore and about a month ago, I decided to take time off. The pain lingered for a few weeks and unfortunately I have fallen back into my old habits of smoking and heavy drinking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need to get back into shape, and I really like the routine I had going, but I can&amp;#39;t deal with that pain again. I&amp;#39;m not being a wuss, I&amp;#39;m 24, I was a top Swimmer and played Football all through High School so I&amp;#39;m used to pushing myself. I also know that i didn&amp;#39;t throw too much too fast at my legs. I started running slowly and only twice a week for a month.

And how important is it to follow step by step the nutrition plan it has?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1306949822,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

They were thinking that really that would be the only way. Well they decide to send her home first, before they have to take that measure.

The only way to keep my job is if I can get one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, outside of that, that is pretty much the only family I have. I have &lt;em&gt;noone&lt;/em&gt; to cosign for me. Yet, I can&amp;#39;t get anything without a cosigner. Fucked up, no?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need help or advice. Please help me Obi-wan Kenobi, you&amp;#39;re my only hope! (seriously)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ve been fucked over by every one of my family members financially. A couple of weeks ago, a crazy situation hit the family I was living with for the summer and I couldn&amp;#39;t stay. Now I need help/advice on how to get a $2500 vehicle in order to keep my job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been basically on my own since I was 15. Sometimes, I just feel like quitting and going into exile. This is my plea for help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1306903721,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}
