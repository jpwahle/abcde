I've been in debt one way or another for most of my life. Whenever I asked for something from my parents that I couldn't afford when I was about 14-17, I would receive it but the monetary value would go on a \"tab\" my mother kept and I would pay her back whenever I could.\n\nThis is probably the single contributing factor into how I spend my money now. I have two credit cards, a Visa and a MC, and a student loan.  Currently, besides my student loan balance, I am approximately $14,000 in personal debt.  I convince myself most times I get stressed out about it and think, \"it could be worse, a lot of people are tens of thousands of dollars in debt so I'm doing alright.\" \nThis attitude towards my situation is pushing me further and further into a debt that I cannot seem to get myself out of. My significant other has no idea that I owe this much and if my mother found out she may or may not have a heart attack before and after she killed me.\n\nI just started university this September and plan to complete a four year degree.  I stopped working full-time and that has started to put a lot of pressure on meeting my monthly payments each month.  I have tried to set up a budget on excel too many times to count and as much as I wish that would work for me, it seems hopeless to try that again.  I know I spend too much and at the rate I am making money now, I'm more scared of the possible risk to my financial future I may be making.\n\nMy MasterCard is thankfully at a very low interest rate, 5.99%. It has the largest owing balance of a little over $10,000. My first thought is continuing to pay my statements and put as much money as possible on my Visa balance: $4000, as it's about 19-20% interest.  I did try this in the past and it didn't work out for me because I did it alone without any support.\n\nMy last resort is having someone else in control of my money entirely.  I would have no primary access to my money whatsoever and if I want to buy anything, I have to ask and hopefully get talked out of. The only problem with that is I don't know who in my life I feel comfortable being this person.  And, obviously, I cannot afford to hire someone legally to do it for me. I really hope to get a handle on this and want to eliminate the possibility of it getting worse.\nI would appreciate any ideas, thoughts, personal stories you wish to share or any general words of encouragement.\n\nThank you for reading!\n","retrieved_on":1441144967,"ups":8,"permalink":"/r/personalfinance/comments/2hxxp1/im_slowly_accumulating_more_and_more_debt_and_i/","link_flair_text":null}

I'm extremely thankful to anybody that takes the time to read all of it   \n\n\n\nI was raised in a super conservative pentecostal Christian family. I started to doubt the religion from the age of 11 (I'm 16 now). Since then, my faith has fallen out of favor. Ive lived as if I was a devout Christian, however, in order to please my parents. \n  \n\n\nAnyways, I've experienced a lot of grief, confusion, despair during these last few years of my life. I've cried out to God, \"please.. You know I need to experience you.. To feel you.. I'm crying out so why aren't you answering\", with no inner spiritual change. I almost feel as if there is a God who just doesn't care much for personal relationship... Most of this despair is brought upon by the thought of what my future would become should I choose to live without religion. My parents would live a life of eternal sorrow, knowing that their child is going to burn in hell for eternity. I would not be able to maintain a normal relationship with them, I know this because my oldest sibling, who is now a believer, turned away for some years. \n  \n\n\nBasically, nothing has happened in my personal life that would lead me to believe there is a God.\n  \n  \n\nI figured that it'd be best if I really devoted a lot of time in the pursuit of God before I write it off completely. As it says in the Bible, seek God with all of your heart and you shall find him. I'm just not sure what I need to do, as I've really been pretending all this time. I need guidance in my spiritual journey.. Where do I start and where do I go?    \n\nObviously, I have way more questions than that. I'd love of you could help answer a couple of them. Just please know that I only come asking for help. I wish not to offend any of you \n  \n\n\nWhy did God make a world in which so many people are destined to hell? He knew when making the world that x amount of people would go to hell. It doesn't help that x is in the majority.\n\n\n  \nHow can we be sure that Christianity is the true religion? Muslims seem to be just as sure, and there are a great number of them.  \n  \n\n  \nA person who is born into a Christian family has a far greater chance of believing in Christ than someone born into an atheist or Islamic family. This doesn't seem fair to me. I think this is true because I know from personal experience that, when parents very very strictly teach religion to their children, they accept it extremely readily and are almost always too afraid to question their own faith \n\n\n\nDoes God ever provide evidence of his existence, even to an individual? It seems foolish to me to follow a religion without SOMETHING to point to his existence. By evidence, I mean spiritual epiphanies, revelations, anything supernatural. \n\n\n\nI recently went to a church camp. At this camp, there was a group prayer. I went to a really wise and spiritual friend of mine, and I asked him, \"please pray for me man. I need to know that God is with me\". We prayed for a bit, and they encouraged me to pray with more and more emotion. It was actually kind of awkward at first because I tend to not easily be influenced by emotions. Actually, a lot of prayers seem to go like this.. Anyways, after praying for around twenty minutes, I began to sob and choke on my tears. I was praying, \"God, sorry for pretending all this time. I can't live anymore as a fake Christian\". At the time I was pretty sure that what I experimenced was spiritual.

We'll see how it goes. I sort of like the collaboration aspect of  being able to talk to people about whatever is going on around here. \n\n    I live in a small town. To secure some type of anonymity, we'll call it Ville from here on out. This town is your typical, boring 2 horse town where the most exciting place is the Walmart which has been here less than 10 years. I guess you can infer that this town is in the south because I referred to the Walmart as *the* Walmart. It's a southern thing. Anyways, a few personal details about me, I am 18, and am a huge theatre nerd, as you could probably tell from my username. I like to partake in the occasional recreational use of marijuana, and I recently dropped out of college after attending there for a whopping month(ish). But, my story starts about 2 moths back when I had been in college about 2 weeks or so.\n\n    I had just bought and awesome bong from the college town that I was in, about 3 hours from Ville, at the time and about 5 grams of kush. I had texted a few good buddies I hadn't seen in a few weeks a few days prior, and we all agreed to meet up and have some fun. Everyone would bring their own bit of weed, bongs, bowls, alcohol, etc..., to share. I couldn't wait, it was a friday, and my last class of the week is on thursday, which allowed me to get an early start at the open road the next morning. I't's about 8 a.m. and I'm ready, I needed to get back home to buy a few more things before i was ready. So I was on the road, windows down, sunroof back, bright sunny day. I knew it would be a badass day...little did I know. Anyways, the music makes the 3 hours go by pretty quickly and I get back home. My parents are at work, so I unload my things, get the \"illegals\" out of my car, I try to cut down traveling with it as much as possible for safety reasons, and head off to *the* Walmart to get a few fold out chairs, some wire hangers, marshmallows, chocolate, fire started, and all the things to make the bonfire just like old times. By the time I'm done shopping, it's about 1 o'clock. I send a group text to everyone and make sure things are going as planned. Everyone says that it's all good, except for my good pal, let's call him, Mike. We usually had our get togethers at his place, but he texted back and said that new neighbors had moved in recently, and they're really strict, and last time he even had the music a tad too loud, they called the cops...not good for a bunch of underage drinking, pot-smoking, loud music playing, rotten teenagers like ourselves. Never fear, for I know a spot, The Powerlines.\n\n    Now, I live out in the woods in a small neighborhood just 8 miles away from *the* Walmart. To get to my house is semi-hard if you don't know where you are going, after a hilly winding road, come to a few turns, and sooner or later you hit a gravel road. Travel down that for half a mile or so and you see our house, surrounded by woods on 2 sides, a lake on one side, and a few other houses on one side. However, if you travel down the gravel road for far enough, you come to a fork in the road, take the right branch, you head up a steep hill, and you see them, towering metal contraptions that have multiple power lines weaving in and out, it was almost spider-web like, that emanated a dim humming noise whenever it was quite enough. Not a house around for at lease 2 miles, surrounded by woods filled with trails that I knew by heart, mainly because my dad and I built them together with a a machine not unsimilar to a bulldozer, just smaller. The trails will be important later on. The gravel road continues on for a while and then stops at a wall of forest. About 4-5 hundred yards before it ends, there is a huge open field that was perfect for a bonfire. We had never had a bonfire there before, in fact, most of my friends that were gonna be there had never even been up to The Powerlines, I liked to keep the place private because it was a place I liked to go to get away and relax. Only my two best friends, Seth and Chris, who are more of a brother to me than my real brother (who lives thousands of miles away and is completely irrelevant to the story), had seen this place and all the trails. We had been friends for years and had spent countless hours hiking throughout the surrounding woods and trails, they knew it almost as well as me.\n\nSo, I had the spot picked out. I texted everyone and simply said, \"Be at my house at 8 p.m., I found a spot.\" I quickly got to work. I gather some fire word, placed them in a good formation for starting a fire, Chris had taught me how to do it, he was a boy scout for like a month, fire wood arrangements and a stupid ass knot were all he learned before he bailed on it. I set up the fold out chairs, set out 4 huge coolers, 2 for sodas, 2 for alcohol, and filled them to the max with drinks and ice to go ahead and be cooling. Mike had a \"dope ass sound system\" and a generator to something, so I set out a fold out table for that. Everything was perfect by 5 o'clock. I sat back in my fold out chair, relaxed for a bit, and admired my \"turn up arena\". It was one my finest achievements, a Mona Lisa of sorts. I was proud, and greatly looking forward to the best night I'd have in awhile.\n\nI admit, I was a tad tired from the longs days work, and dozed off for a bit. I woke up to the sound of the crunching of leaves, a fairly normal occurrence given all the wild life around, even so, it still startled me. I jolted up in my chair and I saw something. Just a blur of a shadow a few inches past the edge of the woods. Now, usually i would immediately jump to the logical conclusion that it was an animal of sorts. But it was fast. Too fast. The shadow disappeared way too quickly to be a deer or something. But, I'm a logical person, I quickly just assumed that I had just woken up, my eyes were getting adjusted to the sun, maybe i was a bit groggy, and a whole host of logical explanations. I looked at my phone to check the time, then put it back in my pocket, only to realize that I didn't actually look at the time. I laughed at myself internally, pulled out the phone again, and checked for real. \"Fuck, it's 7:45.\" I rush to my truck, high tail it to my house, I arrive at about 7:54. Everyones waiting for me. I quickly get out, and give everyone the typical bro-hug, I get to Seth last. I hadn't seen him for a really long time. You see, he's the smarts person I know, he was eligible for an early start at Yale during the summer. He left a week after graduation. I gave him a real hug, he was, and still is my brother. No typical bro-hug would do. After a solid minute, we let go. \"Alright fellas, prepare for the best night of our lives, follow me boys!\" We all get into our respective vehicles, Seth hops into my truck and we head that way.\n\n    When we arrive, Seth and I exchanged a grin, because we knew everyone else would be amazed. It really was a great spot, with a great view of the field and the trees and just everything. It all was perfect. It was going to be a great night, and I needed it to, I was starting to get bad again and this would boost me up.\n\n    We all get out and everyone is fucking silent for a second, admiring it all. I told you it was the Mona Lisa! Then Mike speaks up, \"No fucking way man, this is awesome!\" Brian was just fucking laughing, I think he was already a tad stoned. Jesus, whom we called Zeus, was shouting something in Spanish, I can't remember what exactly, but it apparently was good. Everyone quickly got to work setting up shit. We all put our weed and our \"devices\" out on a table for when the time came. Mike set up his system, Brian brought out the hard liquor and put it in the cooler. Zeus busted out the sweet sweet munchies, real-deal legit Mexican food. All famous old recipes, non of that taco bell bullshit. By the time were were all done it was 8:30 and it was dark, so I lit the fire and began the evening with our ritual. \n\n    We got out our own personal shot glasses we got when we all went up Tennessee, it was personalized with out names on them and everything. We filled them all up with Jager, got out our bowls, filled it to the brim with kush, and had our lighters handy. I stood up and my start my speech.\n   \n    \"Fellas, I'm not gonna make this long and sappy, but I've fucking missed you. These last few weeks at college haven't been the same without you all. As you all know, as per tradition, we must do our sacred Shot and Hit, and tonight, I will be the one who takes Chris's Shot and Hit, so I'm getting fucked up real early! For Chris, rest in peace brother.\"\n\n    Chris had died about a month before we graduated from high school. He had come out to his family that he was gay, and his step-dad beat him...to death. That piece of shit took my brother. I'll never fucking forgive him. My only regret is that I didn't get to beat his ass before he was halled away to prison. Seth and I were there in the hospital when he finally passed. I'm glad we got to say good bye and that we loved him.\n\n    \"For Chris!\" Everyone shouted. Everyone took their Shots and Hits, I took the double. Seth had the honors last time, he knew it was gonna hit me hard, so all he could do was laugh at me. I tell you, that Jager and weed from his glass and bowl was the best I've ever had. \n\n    The night goes on, full of continuous smoking and drinking and pigging out and barfing and music and perfection. I have to admit, buy 12:00, I was severely fucked up, and of course that's when I busted out my beautiful red bong. We prepared that mother fucker, right before I took the first hit, I had to piss. Fuck. \"None of you motherfuckers touch my bong, I'll be back.\" Seth has to piss too, so we walk, well attempt to walk/stumble, about 50 yards away, turn our back to each other and well pissed. \"Just like old times, eh?\" I said. \"Almost buddy, almost.\" We both knew what, or shall I say who, was missing. We get done, zip up out jeans, and that's when we hear it. It was the most terrifying thing, I have ever heard. It's hard to explain, but I'll try. Picture and baby crying as loud as possibly, a screeching sound, a woman's scream, with a deep bassy undertone to it. Needless to say, I sobered up in a flash. I looked at Seth, he looked at me, and we fucking ran. Screaming the whole way, \"Get back in the car, get in the fucking car, get in the car right fucking now!\" We all cram into Mikes S.U.V. Seth and I are bombarded with questions. We don't answer, to be honest, we couldn't answer. I couldn't find the words to speak, and it seemed like my vocal chords were paralyzed. All I could mutter out was, \"Don't fucking go back out there.\" We all slept in Mike's S.U.V. that night. \n\n    When we got up the next morning, saturday, Seth and I told everyone what happened. At that point in time I had forgotten about the shadow in the woods I had seen. Everyone else knew that I had been going through a lot, with depression and that bullshit, and they could tell Seth and I were both shaken up, but they calmed us down a bit, and convinced us to just sit back and smoke some more. We finally chilled out after copious amounts of weed, booze, and food. But I knew Seth and I would talk later, for now, we had to enjoy a day our group. And, we did. \n\nI will update some more in the coming days, there is still a bit more backstory to cover. I'm really tired, and need to get some sleep. Night.\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n"}

We'll see how it goes. I sort of like the collaboration aspect of  being able to talk to people about whatever is going on around here. \n\n  I live in a small town. To secure some type of anonymity, we'll call it Ville from here on out. This town is your typical, boring 2 horse town where the most exciting place is the Walmart which has been here less than 10 years. I guess you can infer that this town is in the south because I referred to the Walmart as *the* Walmart. It's a southern thing. Anyways, a few personal details about me, I am 18, and am a huge theatre nerd, as you could probably tell from my username. I like to partake in the occasional recreational use of marijuana, and I recently dropped out of college after attending there for a whopping month(ish). But, my story starts about 2 months back when I had been in college about 2 weeks or so.\n\n  I had just bought and awesome bong from the college town that I was in, about 3 hours from Ville, at the time and about 5 grams of kush. I had texted a few good buddies I hadn't seen in a few weeks a few days prior, and we all agreed to meet up and have some fun. Everyone would bring their own bit of weed, bongs, bowls, alcohol, etc..., to share. I couldn't wait, it was a friday, and my last class of the week is on thursday, which allowed me to get an early start at the open road the next morning. I't's about 8 a.m. and I'm ready, I needed to get back home to buy a few more things before i was ready. So I was on the road, windows down, sunroof back, bright sunny day. I knew it would be a badass day...little did I know. Anyways, the music makes the 3 hours go by pretty quickly and I get back home. My parents are at work, so I unload my things, get the \"illegals\" out of my car, I try to cut down traveling with it as much as possible for safety reasons, and head off to *the* Walmart to get a few fold out chairs, some wire hangers, marshmallows, chocolate, fire started, and all the things to make the bonfire just like old times. By the time I'm done shopping, it's about 1 o'clock. I send a group text to everyone and make sure things are going as planned. Everyone says that it's all good, except for my good pal, let's call him, Mike. We usually had our get togethers at his place, but he texted back and said that new neighbors had moved in recently, and they're really strict, and last time he even had the music a tad too loud, they called the cops...not good for a bunch of underage drinking, pot-smoking, loud music playing, rotten teenagers like ourselves. Never fear, for I know a spot, The PowerLines.\n\n  Now, I live out in the woods in a small neighborhood just 8 miles away from *the* Walmart. To get to my house is semi-hard if you don't know where you are going, after a hilly winding road, come to a few turns, and sooner or later you hit a gravel road. Travel down that for half a mile or so and you see our house, surrounded by woods on 2 sides, a lake on one side, and a few other houses on one side. However, if you travel down the gravel road for far enough, you come to a fork in the road, take the right branch, you head up a steep hill, and you see them, towering metal contraptions that have multiple power lines weaving in and out, it was almost spider-web like, that emanated a dim humming noise whenever it was quite enough. Not a house around for at lease 2 miles, surrounded by woods filled with trails that I knew by heart, mainly because my dad and I built them together with a a machine not unsimilar to a bulldozer, just smaller. The trails will be important later on. The gravel road continues on for a while and then stops at a wall of forest. About 4-5 hundred yards before it ends, there is a huge open field that was perfect for a bonfire. We had never had a bonfire there before, in fact, most of my friends that were gonna be there had never even been up to The Powerlines, I liked to keep the place private because it was a place I liked to go to get away and relax. Only my two best friends, Seth and Chris, who are more of a brother to me than my real brother (who lives thousands of miles away and is completely irrelevant to the story), had seen this place and all the trails. We had been friends for years and had spent countless hours hiking throughout the surrounding woods and trails, they knew it almost as well as me.\n\n  So, I had the spot picked out. I texted everyone and simply said, \"Be at my house at 8 p.m., I found a spot.\" I quickly got to work. I gather some fire word, placed them in a good formation for starting a fire, Chris had taught me how to do it, he was a boy scout for like a month, fire wood arrangements and a stupid ass knot were all he learned before he bailed on it. I set up the fold out chairs, set out 4 huge coolers, 2 for sodas, 2 for alcohol, and filled them to the max with drinks and ice to go ahead and be cooling. Mike had a \"dope ass sound system\" and a generator to something, so I set out a fold out table for that. Everything was perfect by 5 o'clock. I sat back in my fold out chair, relaxed for a bit, and admired my \"turn up arena\". It was one my finest achievements, a Mona Lisa of sorts. I was proud, and greatly looking forward to the best night I'd have in awhile.\n\n  I admit, I was a tad tired from the longs days work, and dozed off for a bit. I woke up to the sound of the crunching of leaves, a fairly normal occurrence given all the wild life around, even so, it still startled me. I jolted up in my chair and I saw something. Just a blur of a shadow a few inches past the edge of the woods. Now, usually i would immediately jump to the logical conclusion that it was an animal of sorts. But it was fast. Too fast. The shadow disappeared way too quickly to be a deer or something. But, I'm a logical person, I quickly just assumed that I had just woken up, my eyes were getting adjusted to the sun, maybe i was a bit groggy, and a whole host of logical explanations. I looked at my phone to check the time, then put it back in my pocket, only to realize that I didn't actually look at the time. I laughed at myself internally, pulled out the phone again, and checked for real. \"Fuck, it's 7:45.\" I rush to my truck, high tail it to my house, I arrive at about 7:54. Everyones waiting for me. I quickly get out, and give everyone the typical bro-hug, I get to Seth last. I hadn't seen him for a really long time. You see, he's the smarts person I know, he was eligible for an early start at Yale during the summer. He left a week after graduation. I gave him a real hug, he was, and still is my brother. No typical bro-hug would do. After a solid minute, we let go. \"Alright fellas, prepare for the best night of our lives, follow me boys!\" We all get into our respective vehicles, Seth hops into my truck and we head that way.\n\n  When we arrive, Seth and I exchanged a grin, because we knew everyone else would be amazed. It really was a great spot, with a great view of the field and the trees and just everything. It all was perfect. It was going to be a great night, and I needed it to, I was starting to get bad again and this would boost me up.\n\n  We all get out and everyone is fucking silent for a second, admiring it all. I told you it was the Mona Lisa! Then Mike speaks up, \"No fucking way man, this is awesome!\" Brian was just fucking laughing, I think he was already a tad stoned. Jesus, whom we called Zeus, was shouting something in Spanish, I can't remember what exactly, but it apparently was good. Everyone quickly got to work setting up shit. We all put our weed and our \"devices\" out on a table for when the time came. Mike set up his system, Brian brought out the hard liquor and put it in the cooler. Zeus busted out the sweet sweet munchies, real-deal legit Mexican food. All famous old recipes, non of that taco bell bullshit. By the time were were all done it was 8:30 and it was dark, so I lit the fire and began the evening with our ritual. \n\n  We got out our own personal shot glasses we got when we all went up Tennessee, it was personalized with out names on them and everything. We filled them all up with Jager, got out our bowls, filled it to the brim with kush, and had our lighters handy. I stood up and my start my speech.\n   \n   &gt; \"Fellas, I'm not gonna make this long and sappy, but I've fucking missed you. These last few weeks at college haven't been the same without you all. As you all know, as per tradition, we must do our sacred Shot and Hit, and tonight, I will be the one who takes Chris's Shot and Hit, so I'm getting fucked up real early! For Chris, rest in peace brother.\"\n\n  Chris had died about a month before we graduated from high school. He had come out to his family that he was gay, and his step-dad beat him...to death. That piece of shit took my brother. I'll never fucking forgive him. My only regret is that I didn't get to beat his ass before he was halled away to prison. Seth and I were there in the hospital when he finally passed. I'm glad we got to say good bye and that we loved him. I haven't been dealing well with the loss...\n\n  \"For Chris!\" Everyone shouted. Everyone took their Shots and Hits, I took the double. Seth had the honors last time, he knew it was gonna hit me hard, so all he could do was laugh at me. I tell you, that Jager and weed from his glass and bowl was the best I've ever had. \n\n  The night goes on, full of continuous smoking and drinking and pigging out and barfing and music and perfection. I have to admit, buy 12:00, I was severely fucked up, and of course that's when I busted out my beautiful red bong. We prepared that mother fucker, right before I took the first hit, I had to piss. Fuck. \"None of you motherfuckers touch my bong, I'll be back.\" Seth has to piss too, so we walk, well attempt to walk/stumble, about 50 yards away, turn our back to each other and well pissed. \"Just like old times, eh?\" I said. \"Almost buddy, almost.\" We both knew what, or shall I say who, was missing. We get done, zip up out jeans, and that's when we hear it. It was the most terrifying thing, I have ever heard. It's hard to explain, but I'll try. Picture and baby crying as loud as possibly, a screeching sound, a woman's scream, with a deep bassy undertone to it. Needless to say, I sobered up in a flash. I looked at Seth, he looked at me, and we fucking ran. Screaming the whole way, \"Get back in the car, get in the fucking car, get in the car right fucking now!\" We all cram into Mikes S.U.V. Seth and I are bombarded with questions. We don't answer, to be honest, we couldn't answer. I couldn't find the words to speak, and it seemed like my vocal chords were paralyzed. All I could mutter out was, \"Don't fucking go back out there.\" We all slept in Mike's S.U.V. that night. \n\n  When we got up the next morning, saturday, Seth and I told everyone what happened. At that point in time I had forgotten about the shadow in the woods I had seen. Everyone else knew that I had been going through a lot, with depression and that bullshit, and they could tell Seth and I were both shaken up, but they calmed us down a bit, and convinced us to just sit back and smoke some more. We finally chilled out after copious amounts of weed, booze, and food. But I knew Seth and I would talk later, for now, we had to enjoy a day our group. And, we did. \n\n  I will update some more in the coming days, there is still a bit more backstory to cover. I'm really tired, and need to get some sleep. Night.\n\nEdit: Typos and such","retrieved_on":1441144909,"ups":3,"permalink":"/r/nosleep/comments/2hy25j/it_all_started_with_the_powerlines/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","title":"It all started with the PowerLines","secure_media_embed":{},"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"nosleep","created_utc":"1412124514","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.nosleep","hide_score":false}

I have straight A's, I've never done anything bad, I never get in trouble, and I always do what i'm told but I will never be more important than my sister. My older sister who has multiple mental issues, takes medicine just to function throughout the day and is a violent, rude person( but is still very functional on her own) has always been the favourite. I know that since she has mental issues she needs a little more love and care but my parents go way over the top and ignore me. I am 18 and she is 20. My parents let her take a year off after high school to \"find herself\" and during this year they bought her a car( I asked to purchase a car in full with my own money, they said no as it would have to be parked on the street and they didn't want that) and let her have no job. During this time I was working a part time job and saving all of my money for school. She then went into college after that year off as I was in my final year of high school. She cam home every single weekend during the time she was there and eventually failed out of that program and enrolled in a new one this year. I am now in college to and have gotten a half scholarship that pays for my tuition and I have the money saved up from working which is around 10'000 dollars. I have been coming home these first few weeks of school because I have a very hard time handling stress and being on my own for the first time is very stressful (It has gotten so bad that I have passed out in class due to it) and today my parents called me to inform me that I am no longer able to come home from school anymore as it is too much money to drive and come pick me up (I am an hour away from home the same distance my sister is). I understand that they want me to be an adult and to learn to live on my own and I see a councillor to help with me stress management but at the same time they allow my sister to come home every single weekend still. The worst part is my boyfriend though. Now I realize I am only 18 and that they have concerns about my boyfriend staying with me at my apartment but we have been together for 2 years now we are very safe and my mother nows that I am on the pill and he always uses protection as neither one of us wants a kid and we are not willing to risk anything. My sister has a boyfriend as well they've been together for a 3 moths and is allowed to stay with her whenever she wants I understand she is older but she has already been pregnant once but it sadly ended in a miscarriage.

I don't believe in God, but also reject the \"atheist\" label for reasons that are outside the scope of this post. When people ask, my go-to line is \"I didn't have a Christian upbringing\" and that usually seems to satisfy the asker's curiosity.\n\nSo over the past year or two, I've travelled all over the east coast, living in a van and working online, and have been wanting to check out a Sunday morning service, more out of curiosity than anything else. Thing is, since I don't know how any of this works, I've always been too shy. What should I wear? What, if anything, am I supposed to do? What if people start asking me stuff and don't like me being an outsider just passing through? So I kept chickening out and thinking \"eh... next Sunday maybe.\"\n\nAnyway, now I'm settling down for a bit in a smallish town in western Virginia, and thought I'd give it a real go, but maybe y'all can help me steel myself. I'm thinking of going specifically to UCC, because from what I've heard and read about those guys it looks like I could appreciate what they're about.\n\nSo, like, I feel stupid asking this but... what goes on at a Sunday service? Do people all know each other and socialize a lot? Is it going to be weird if this stranger shows up on his own? Should I expect people to come and talk to me? Is there going to be singing? Constantly standing up and sitting down based on cues that I'm sure to miss? (From these last two questions, you can probably guess that what little contact I had with religion was with Catholicism.)\n\nI mean I'm sure everyone will be welcoming and all, and it's not like UCC folks are going to pull out the tar and feathers, but... help me feel less weird about this, maybe? I'm not looking for spiritual awakening or doing any kind of soul-searching, I just want to hear what these people have to say. Heck, if it's interesting and inspiring, maybe keep going every week, I dunno.\n\nThanks for reading!","media":null,"ups":9,"retrieved_on":1441144876,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/Christianity/comments/2hy4p1/nonchristian_never_been_to_church_would_like_to/","downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"Non-Christian, never been to church, would like to check it out but am intimidated - could use some reassurance or tips","secure_media_embed":{},"created_utc":"1412125974","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Christianity","domain":"self.Christianity","hide_score":false}

I know this is a long story, but it's definitely worth the read.\nTo preface this story I'll give a little background on my friend and his family:\nI have a friend whose mother had a first marriage before she met his father. They had two children, my friend's half brother and half sister. Tragically his mother's first husband passed away in his (my friend's) childhood home (in the room that used to be his sister's room; this will be relevant later). After that his mom met my friend's father and had him and his sister. \n\nFast forward to 2012. I'm 20 at this point, and he had \"that\" house that everyone went to for parties and was the gathering place for all our friends. I can't remember the date, but he had people over and we all had a good time drinking and such, as young people do. Mostly everyone left by about 2:00 AM, and being pretty intoxicated in addition to lacking a ride I decided to crash there. His mom didn't like us sleeping on the living room couches so his sister's room was designated as my room for the night. I should mention I've had creepy stuff happen at his house before, lights going on and off by themselves, shadows; I also have friends who refuse to sleep there because they've seen some freaky shit (shadows following them around the house).\n\nThis is where it gets creepy. I get some pillows and blankets and start to get acquainted with the room. The feeling wasn't necessarily ominous, but at the same time it either felt like something was in the room with me or that something was watching me. I laid in the bed and immediately moved on my side so that I was facing the wall because there was an overwhelming feeling of a presence in the room. I remember picturing the room behind me in my mind, as if there was an eye in the back of my head. I saw the room, as it normally was, with the addition of a man dressed like a stereotypical 90's dad; sperry's or another basic dress shoe, khaki's, plaid or another pattern button down shirt, aviator-style glasses and a goatee with medium-length brown hair. It seemed as if he was just looking at me in an inquisitive way. I slept the night and left in the morning. \n\nIt didn't scare me or anything because it wasn't menacing, but it was definitely unsettling because it personified the presence in the room. Later that year I met his (my friend's) half sister (who was the \"ghost's\" daughter, for all intents and purposes) and one way or another the story was brought up. I began describing the person I saw to her and it didn't take long until she was white in the face and extremely shocked yet enthralled at the same time. Once I was done she immediately said \"that's my dad, you met my dad\". I had never seen a picture of him before that and I still haven't, but every time I talk to his (my friend's) half sister and his half brother (who I've known for a long time) about it they insist it was him and that I described him perfectly. \n\nTL;DR Was able to accurately describe my friend's dead father to his half sister having never seen him or a picture of him while I've been alive.\n\nEDIT: Changed paragraph structure \n","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/Paranormal/comments/2hy72s/met_my_friends_dad_in_my_minds_eye_who_died/","is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"realdickparty_com","name":"t3_2hy72s","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"archived":true,"id":"2hy72s","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":2,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"score":4,"edited":1412143797,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjxn","from_kind":null,"created":1412130926,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/2hy72s/met_my_friends_dad_in_my_minds_eye_who_died/"}

I've always liked the idea of them, but i've never found anything that stood out enough for me to get one. Until last year, I found a beautiful lion tattoo that has meaning for me. My family is very closed minded about tattoos though, so I never mentioned getting one to them cause I knew they wouldn't be too happy about the idea.\n\nI've had a photo of the lion tattoo as my phone background for about 6 months now, because I wanted to see if I would get sick of it at all, and even after that time, I look at it and I still love it sooo much. So I spent a few months researching Tattoo shops and just tips on getting your first tattoo. I decided I really wanted it on my forearm. I've always wanted a tattoo there and the one I like seems like a perfect fit for that spot. \n\nI told my parents and they weren't happy about it but they asked questions, and told me that they were okay with it because it's my decision but they still think i'll regret it. Then I told my older sister and she lectured me on how I should just wait till i'm 30 years old to get one because then I won't regret it. She also said that in a few years i'm not going to like it and I won't feel the meaning of it anymore. THEN I told my aunt and uncle (my aunt has a tattoo on her wrist and her ankle, got them in the last 2 years) and they were telling me not to do it because i'm going to regret it. They all keep saying \"Just get a small tattoo first somewhere that people can't see it\". I would but I've been trying to find a small tattoo that I might like for YEARS and never found anything. I've always like bigger tattoos.\n\nFor me personally, I've been so excited about this tattoo for a really long time. I won't be getting it done until March, so I have a lot of time to think about it. But I've already spent a ton of time thinking and researching. The only time I feel like i'm going to regret the tattoo later, is when my family tells me I will. But i'm also worried that they'll be right, and I will regret it, but i'm just too excited about it and I can't see that yet.\n\nTL;DR I'm 19, really excited about getting a lion tattoo on my forearm in march, family is telling me not to do it because I'll regret it, and it's causing me to feel extremely doubtful about it.\n\nHave any of you regretted tattoos you got in your teens? What kind of tattoos were they? Do you think I should wait until I'm hella old? I need advice people!

He's made sure me, my mother, my aunt and my brothers can't drive or be able to gets jobs. (no like there are jobs here anyways.)\n\n\nHe has to control everything that goes on in this house. We aren't allowed to talk too loud, we aren't allowed to laugh, we aren't allowed to have music playing too loud. And yet he can sit at his computer all day and yell and argue with people in chat rooms, he can have his TV blasting, he can buy whatever he wants, he can go where ever he wants.\n\n\nHe's sickening, he's a pervert, he's physically and emotionally abusive. (I've been slapped in the face by him.)\nHe's walks up and down the hall, making sure everyone is in their place, in their rooms. It feels like he's a warden keeping his prisoners in check.

He'll even say, \"I'm stuffed,\" as he's fixing the sandwiches.\n\nWe are behind on the house a month or two. It's about $1,400 a month along with a $600~$800 electric bill on top of all the other bills and groceries.\n\nHe lies about how much money we have to spend and will yell at us in the store as loud as he can if we want to get something, even if it's under $10. He's yelled at cashiers, having them basically in tears.\n\nHe throws fits in front of people so they feel sorry for him, he always has to be the center of attention or he whines. \n\n\nAnd yet my mother can't understand why I don't feel sorry for him when he's having trouble breathing. He's in his late 60's, has COPD and emphysema. Don't know or care what else he has. He can't go two steps without having a breathing problem when we're out, and yet he can RUN from his room to the coffee pot and back, or run to get food. He can yell at us for hours and hours at the top of his lungs without one stopping to catch his breath.\n\n\nWhen he gets really pissed or stressed his first thing is to get beer.\n\nWhen he gets mad while he's driving, he steps on the gas, saying he'll crash the car and kill us.\n\nHe made it so when he dies, that we'll only get $500 a month to live on until he'd turn 70. And if he dies at, or after 70, we get nothing.\n\nWhen i say I applied for a job I'm expected to hand over my entire pay check to him but if my brother applies for a job, \"if you get it you can save up money for yourself.\"\n\nI know I left out a lot of stuff and my grammar and spelling is probably all kinds of fucked up.

Treatment involves open heart surgeries, heart transplants, and a shunt put in the first couple of days. The girl now works at Zales as a store clerk, but used to be a stay at home mom.

Not trying to be all edgy and shit but it really has been. Break ups, hospitalization, suicide attempt, the whole shebang. Especially this past week. I did get a new job, which I'll admit I'm very proud of myself for, but the amount of stress that I receive from it is unreal. I have no idea how my coworkers are able to shut off at the end of the day (or they seem to) but I can't stop stressing about how I'm going to appear the next day, how I'm gonna say something dumb and stupid to the nice baristas, how I'm gonna fuck something up and get yelled at thrice by the people above me, how I'm probably going to be labeled as \"That Guy\" at work, like how I've been \"That Guy\" in class, or \"That Guy\" in my circle of friends.\n\nBut then it was my day off yesterday. Fucking great, I thought. Went downtown, second I get off the bus, lady collapses in front of me and goes into full seizure mode. Blood starts pouring out of her head. A passing woman frantically calls 911 while myself and some others position her so that she didn't die on us (her face was blue at that point). Ambulance came, she got carted away and we left like any normal human being should - humbly. I shouldn't be complaining at all about this, and please yell at me if I'm being insensitive, but it fucked me up for the rest of the day. Couldn't do anything. Just sat at home smoking weed and watching movies. I just helped someone from potentially dying, why the fuck do I feel like shit?\n\nAnd then comes today. Today is my birthday. I'm 20 years old. I hate my birthday because it reminds me of how shit these past two decades have been. So I woke up today in a really shitty mood. With some quick background context, someone I had been conversing on tumblr with (who I've tried to give advice for depression on multiple occasions) repeated the same thing to me, and I snapped and told her that she really could fucking do it, and not to waste her teenage years like I did, but she sent a message saying that she's given up on trying to get better.\n\nI fucking tried, man, I tried so long to help her, and I'm just fucking exasperated. I can't even deal with myself, but I feel so fucking bad for her. \n\nAnd it's only now that I realize that the depression ouroboros never ends. Self-eating and immortal. So I pressed the knife against the underbelly of my arm. Held it there for about a minute. Ready to go down the road. Ready to give in. Ready to end. \n\nBut I didn't.

I've never liked kids, like EVER, and have always been pretty vocal about it. My mom has known since I was 1.5 years old and told her, cold as ice, to put some strange baby down as it didn't belong to her, that I did not like children. She and my dad have always been fine with this and have told me repeatedly that they support the fact that I never want to be a parent and that they'll never be grandparents (I'm an only child). Basically they say it's my life and if I'm happy with my decisions then they're happy.\n\nI've been on this sub for almost a year now and it's helped me a lot to come to terms with my views on being CF as it caused me a lot of anxiety and sadness to realize what choosing this kind of lifestyle would mean in terms of the romance pool and whether or not I was making a good choice. It also introduced me to the idea that permanent sterilization is an option for people like us. So around May I went in to get a consultation from my doctor for TL. I left there in rage tears as his entire demeanour changed the second I asked for the referral. I found him to be very dismissive and he kind of took on the tone of someone who was very disappointed in me - he even tried to book me an appointment with a doctor 3 hours away from the *capital city* I live in to make it harder for me. Through all of this, my mom was supportive and also seemed frustrated by the doctor's reaction as it was my decision and, frankly, none of his god damn business. \n\nA few days ago I FINALLY got an appointment booked with a gyno and am scheduled to go for a consult in about 2 weeks - hooray!! As an added precaution, since I'm 27, single, and have no kids, I asked my parents and some of my long term friends to draft up some letters for said doctor stating things like how long they've known me, that this isn't something that came out of the blue, that they support me, etc. Everyone except my mom (who I asked in an email) replied with a definite yes. \n\nI hadn't heard anything from my mom about it for a few days so I asked her just now on the phone if she'd gotten my email, to which she said yes she had. I then asked her if she'd mind taking 20 mins to draft one up for me and she told me she didn't know, she was thinking about it. \n\nThinking about it. She has always been supportive and understanding, even when some friends were not. She has *always* known how I feel about this. Yet she needs to think about it. I asked her what it was she could possibly have to think about. She replied with something along these lines:\n\nMom: But what if you change your mind?\n\nMe: Umm...I've been like this for 27 years, I'm not changing my mind. And if, for some reason I do, there's always reversal, IVF, surrogacy, or adoption. \n\nMom: You just said \"If I change my mind\".\n\nMe: So what? I'm not going to, I'm just saying IF I do, there are options.\n\nMom: I think there are other options you should think about before doing something permanent.\n\nMe: But I WANT permanent. I've already looked into and considered other options and decided against them. What's the point of having something temporary that I always have to keep on top of when I know I don't ever want to get pregnant?\n\nMom: Can't you just get something else until you're like 40 and then get it done?\n\nYeah...Let's just have me go through aaaaall of my reproductive years on different kinds of BC until I get to the age where I can't actually have kids anymore and then go ahead and get sterilized because that makes a huge amount of sense. I asked her again why, exactly, she needs to think about this as she knows damn well that a) I hate kids with a passion, b) I would feel horrible and selfish to ever bring another kid into this world when there's thousands that are already here than need homes (not to mention that there are over 7 *billion* people in existence right now), and c) that pregnancy disgusts and horrifies me to the extent I can't say the word \"pregnant\" to my own mom without my mouth watering like I'm about to puke. She told me she thinks I'm being rash and mellow dramatic about the whole TL thing. \n\nWHAT. THE. ACTUAL. FUCK. I've been like this my entire life, you've always said you're fine with it, but now that I'm actually taking it into my own hands and doing something about it, you think I'm suddenly being rash and \"mellow dramatic\"?. Sorry, but whether or not I'm able to get this done, my views on getting knocked up with some nasty gut parasite are never going to change. \n\nI feel as if she's just been lying about being supportive of my CF choices all of these years and is just waiting until I change my mind because she thinks I'm just going through a phase. I'm absolutely shocked, I thought she'd be the first one to write up a letter showing her support yet she's the only one out of all the people I've asked to not already agree. \n\nI don't really know what else to say, I'm just really shocked and gutted.

Problem was, finding the guy. So I posted an ad on craigslist (lame, I know) asking for a hook up. \n\nI had no expectations, but all these guys actually answered, sadly none of them really caught my attention. Until this guy sent me a message on kik. I could see from his pic that he was very handsome, so I decided to answer him back. He ended up taking me home, where we talked a little and tried to get to know each other. I let him know that I didn't want to pursue a relationship or anything like that, I was just tired of not knowing what sex felt like. \n\nWhile we were talking, he told me that I was pretty. No man has ever told me that before. We started making out, one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. He told me how I was so hot and complimented my appearance like nobody ever has. I was in cloud nine. When we were done, he decided to let me know that he had a girlfriend (he specified that it was a long distance relationship). That didn't really phase me that much, but he seemed really guilty about cheating on her. I stayed a little longer and we had sex again. This time he didn't come, and once he received a text from his girlfriend, he called it quits and took me home. I was quiet the whole ride back, trying to process what just had happened. He told me not to be so quiet, to talk to him. We started talking about random stuff. When he dropped me off, he told me that we were going to continue our conversation later on.  \n\nThe next day he texted me to ask me something. At the end of the conversation he said \"text you next week.\" Now, I really liked the sex, and I've been looking for other dudes to have sex with (with no success) but I still can't stop thinking about him. I promised myself I wouldn't get attached, but I'm afraid I might be. I don't want a relationship with him, since I know he's willing to cheat on his girlfriend, but I do want to have more sex with him. I was feeling kind of desperate the other day and I sent him a message telling him that I wanted to hook up again. I have yet to hear back from him. I know I'm just a one night stand, I know he has a girlfriend, but being ignored by him kinda hurt. I liked the experience, even if the guy lied to me at first and now he's ignoring me, but I kind of regret it now. I just had to tell somebody. And yes, I know I am a horrible person for trying to sleep with someone who has a girlfriend.","retrieved_on":1441144740,"ups":0,"permalink":"/r/offmychest/comments/2hyf63/im_starting_to_regret_my_first_time/","link_flair_text":null,"author":"ih8erryone","from":null,"is_self":true,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":1,"id":"2hyf63","archived":true,"name":"t3_2hyf63","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":0,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2hyf63/im_starting_to_regret_my_first_time/","created":1412135790,"subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","from_kind":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false}

My parents divorced early and I lived with my mom from 6-13 in Ohio, whereas I had been in Texas before. Anyway, When I was 13, I came home from school one day and my mom had been arrested for like the 5th time for doing drugs. But this time was permanent. (I haven't seen her since.)\n\nAfter that, my grandma drove up to Ohio from Texas to get me, and brought my dad with her. Then we drove back, and I moved in with my grandma. My grandma is awesome. Anyway, I found out shortly after moving in that my uncle would also be living with my grandma. My uncle is 40. He has \"mental problems\" as my grandparents describe it, so they use that as an excuse to put up with his bs, such as leaving messes everywhere, trashes my grandmas car, never having a job, and they said he will probably never move out because is isn't capable.\n\nSo that went on for about 2 years, and oh man I hated it. His blatant disrespect for how lucky he was made me so angry. He was practically sucking financial resources out of my grandparents for free because he was lazy. Two years of rent free life. That combined with the fact that he is an enormous jerk really makes me hate him.\n\nAfter those 2 years, my grandma brings up that my dad, back in Dallas (I live in a very small town about an hour away) has been living on the streets long enough, so she lets HIM move in as well. When HE moves in, he does the same thing as my uncle. Freeloading, whining, being ungrateful, and just generally being a drain and a pain in the ass.\n\nHaving to live with these two constantly makes me dread being home. It has made me really sour. I literally never smile when they are around, and I never speak to them. When they speak to me I just answer with quick one word answers and try to end the conversation as quickly as possible. My uncle still lives here, going on nearly 4 years (I'm 16.). My dad has been here for about 3 months, but he is no closer to moving out than he was when he got here. I am constantly reassured he will be gone as soon as he gets his first paycheck, but he doesn't have a job and I'm not holding my breathe. My grandma knows I am super unhappy with them being here, but she and my sister both say I am being a dick. They say that my dad and uncle are family, and I shouldn't hate them, that I should give them more chances.\n\nSince my entire life all of my family, besides my little sister and grandparents, have been drug addicts, failures, and freeloaders, I never really learned to value family. I just don't feel it. But I do feel intense anger towards both of these gents.\n\nSo there you go, reddit. Am I justified? Am I being unreasonable?","media":null,"ups":8,"retrieved_on":1441144733,"link_flair_text":"asshole","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2hyfpw/aita_for_hating_my_dad_and_uncle/"}

Its set in some vague ancient gladiator type of world and I am part of the strongest military countries in the world. I'm one of the few female gladiator/general warriors and I enter a competition that just happened to pop out of nowhere. I wouldn't have been interested except that the winner will win a lifetimes worth of coins! I know I have few choices in life, and being a woman in my country isn't helping... It helps even less that I am not the epitomy of female fragile beauty in my country...even though I became the way I did out of necesity. I had to help protect my outskirt village from all kinds of turmoil...we never did have enough government support.\n\nSo I enter the competition and my unique, unstructured, and self taught fighting style ends up winning the competition. I bow to the audience and make my way into the stadium box for my prize. Once there I am introduced to a foreigner... One of my government officials says that the competition was set up so that the foreigner would have some nice entertainment during his visit. My government official thanks me and starts handing me the money. The foreigner stops him and says that he wishes to take me back to his country as a wife. I am confused and obviously refuse, reaching out to take my money. The foreginer tells the official that if he wants relations with his country to go well I must go with him.\n\nI like the idea of making a story along with the obvious sexual aspect. Id love to make it political where he wanted to take me back because having my country's strongest female warrior and breeding me to make an heir would look good/you secretly want a body guard that can always be with you/ in your country strong women is the epitomy of beauty/ you just want to be mischevious and you think this is funny.

I really just wanted to let it be known what I want for myself.","permalink":"/r/Anxiety/comments/2hygeu/an_attempt_to_change_my_life/","link_flair_text":null,"title":"An attempt to change my life.","secure_media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","domain":"self.Anxiety","hide_score":false,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Anxiety","created_utc":"1412132925","author_flair_text":null,"quarantine":false,"score":1,"edited":false,"stickied":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2hygeu/an_attempt_to_change_my_life/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qmij","created":1412136525,"from_id":null,"is_self":true,"author":"everytimeidoug","from":null,"archived":true,"id":"2hygeu","name":"t3_2hygeu","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":2}

I'm falling behind on school work. I don't know what I'm doing. And all I want to do right now, for whatever fucking reason, is start cutting myself. I don't even know why.

I joined the military and stopped going to church  (I still go whenever I'm home).  About a year ago I started questioning everything.  \n  \nOne of the biggest \"pet-peeves\" that I have is whenever someone says \"Thank God\" or \"pray to God and He'll help you\" in regards to something like finding or looking for a job, but yet tell you that you can't \"sit and wait for the job to come, you have to look for it\", doesn't that take away everything you've just said about God helping you?  How do you know that Person A was able to find a job because they were actually looking hard enough for one and not because \"God helped them\" or that Person B should \"Thank God\" for that promotion he got at worked because it is because of God that he got it and not because he worked hard.  \n  \nSorry for this mini rant, I have had questions like these for the past year with no one to ask them to","media":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.Christianity","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1412133366","subreddit":"Christianity","media_embed":{},"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"What makes you believe?","thumbnail":"default","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh6c","created":1412136966,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/2hyh36/what_makes_you_believe/","secure_media":null,"score":1,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"name":"t3_2hyh36","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"id":"2hyh36","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":10,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"[deleted]"}
