Im irrational, paranoid and pussy as heck.   \n\n\nOk so in high school I used to share a bedroom with my sister. Sometimes we would just spook ourselves from sleep. We played lots of pranks on each other and we are both weenies too so we slept with a night light. Ofc regardless of this, I'm still a horror and thriller movie fanatic because I love a good spook.   \nBut here is the thing, a couple of years ago, we both were just talking about scary experiences we both may have had or unexplained occurrences. We both are artistic and draw as hobbies. So i told her about how I never felt completely safe when we shared a bedroom. I've moved out of my mom's house when I was 18 and I'm 25 now btw.   \nAnyway! My sister also agreed to the same feeling and we had the bright idea to draw out the reason why we felt uncomfortable in that room. We never talked about this to each other before, and thought it would be interesting to see what we felt was the reason why. Without giving each other much detail, we both agreed that the corner behind our door made us feel anxious, as our bed was facing towards it and that the presence we felt was ominous.   \nWe both shocked each other when we both revealed the exact same interpretation of the thing that we felt haunted us!   \nWe both drew a picture of a girl, with long black dirty stringy hair, with pitch black eyes glaring through the strands, pale skin, with a tattered dress on. She had almost like a Chelsea grin, and a deranged look on her face. She also had a crooked neck, and extremely skinny. When we would \"see\" her, she was always crouched down on the floor just staring back at us. We both agreed we didn't always feel her in the room. But we used to wake up at random hours of the night and feel her in the room and be too scared to go back to sleep or even move. Myself in particular, would have lots of sleep paralysis episodes and could feel this presence moving about. I remember one instance where I woke up straight from deep sleep and was stricken with so much fear, because I would feel \"it\" behind me, just watching me sleep. For a long time, I've accounted this to stress. I've always had anxiety and paranoia is a part of it, but I also believe in ghosts and demons.   \nI read an article a long time ago that a lot of people, with no relation, who experience sleep paralysis will dream of the same evil entity or being in their dreams.   \n\n\nSo I'm wondering, have any one ever experienced this same entity? Or experienced something similar? Also, were we being haunted or are we just a couple of hyperactive weenies who may have watched Ju-On one too many times?   \nI need peaceful sleep please   \nAlso gave myself an anxiety attack just suddenly remembering this traumatic ass occurrence.

I smoke a decent amount of marijuana and am about to graduate highschool.)\n\nSkip the first paragraph if you don't care about the back story- I'm your typical pothead. I loved playing football but hate school. Football is over and i don't really plan to play in college. Or even go to college in general. Like i said i fucking hate school. Honestly kind of surprised I'm going to graduate... Always going in the last few days beging my teachers to at least let me pass. And it worked alot. Every semester i would not care and halfass everything because I new I would somehow figure it out later. I'm on track to graduate as long as I pass all my classes but one.. I already don't show up to woods so I have no room to fuck up now. I've started to actually trying in school. It's really not that hard but i already screwed that up. I don't really care. I can always enroll into community college and get my pre requisites out of the way then go to a big school to get my bachelors. \n\n I just moved houses and you know I smoke weed so i own weed parifenelia. Pipes, blunt raps, grinder, you name it. I probably have it. I don't have a lot but if someone found my stash they would definently know what was going on. And fuck me because that is just what happened. (Not exactly) Well when we moved I grabbed all my shit just forgot that i filtered out all the garbage stuff out. Like broken pipes, old juul pods, empty lighters. You know the stuff you don't need. So when we were moving the first thing I packed up was the box of my good shit and hid it in my clothes box. Unfortunately I fogot my old box in my closet and when my mom went through the house one last time (with out me) she found that box. Right before I went to the car to upload the last few things from the old house my mom said she found the box. I don't know what i said but it was along the lines of \"what the fuck why did you go through my shit\" i know i shouldn't be cussing at my mom but it was more directed at my aunt who was trying to butt in the conversation. She really pisses me off. Can never mind her own god damn business. They both brought it up that first time but neither have said anything since. I've talked to them casually since they brought it up. But still haven't wanted to elaborate on finding my stash. I talked to my sister and she told me that my mom just doesn't want to believe her \"baby boy\" could ever do anything like that. I'm just confused on what to do. I'm not going to bring it up enless they do. What the fuck, why would I? It's only been like a hour so it something that can still happen. But i feel like she might just brush it off and not bring it up. I feel like she might just not want to have that conversation with me. I know it's a weekday and this might go unnoticed because of shit memes but i just wanted to share this with you guys. Lmk what you think.. I try to keep you updated.

I'd like to know, what were the reasons for you leaving, or the program \"not working?\" Basically, what about the program made you leave?\n\nFurthermore, those of you who are motivated enough to have (or are) self-recovered after checking yourself out, I'd like to hear from you as well. \n\nI'm now in PHP, and finishing my 1st week after 23 days in the hospital, followed by a week at home. I felt wayyyyy better recovering on my own at home. I'm 28, and currently living at \"home\" with parents\/brother (post-college\/working to earn apartment $$$ and build career.) Once I reached an agreement with my family about my meal plan and boundaries, I felt way more confident in recovery, and like I had control.

We work at a large factory that employs thousands of people on both day and night shifts. We both work nights on the same group, but different teams. Yes I know dating a co worker is a bad idea, I have made questionable decisions in my life. I'm 25 now, but 24 when dating and he's 29 now but 28 while dating. Side note: Ex has type 1 diabetes and was diagnosed at least 20 years ago. It comes up later.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, lets get into the why. So we began dating in early September of 18 and he broke up with me in mid october I think? We got back together a week later and broke up early November regardless. He began the break up, but I finalized it. I told him I gave him a second chance, he blew it and he would not get a third chance. We are now approaching February and he still is trying to get me back in a relationship with him. \n\nAnd this is where it gets complicated. Ex has a mental illness that has not been treated or even addressed by him. He went to a doctor to get medication for his ADHD and got told that he was also a narcissist. Also on that note, he lied about the severity of his ADHD to get the strongest medication he could because, in his own words, he \"loves drugs\", oxy, vyvanse and xanex mostly. This was a problem for me a bit, I'm not a drug user but as long as it didn't effect me I kept the mindset that he was a grown man that could make his own decisions. \n\nAnyways. So the symptoms of his illness are paranoia, dissociation, agitation, and \"fidgeting\". Fidgeting is in quotes because he would pace, and just not be still but I'm not sure what to properly call it. His paranoia was extreme. He once thought that I had been replaced while we were dating because \"my hair color looked different\" and \"my tattoos were more vivid\". He thought that there were people keeping me captive in my own home and forcing me to make drugs. Among other things. His dissociation was pretty bad too. He thought he was untouchable, and even told me to call him a God because in his mind he was. \n\nRecently, as in last week, he went missing. From Monday to late Tuesday no one knew where he was. In a dissociatiated state, he wandered around town near his apartment building before finding his way back to his apartment. We live in the mid-west and he claims the diesel fuel in his truck froze or something? So he had to walk and instead of walking home, he began wandering town. He claims that all of what he did was because he had \"low blood sugar\" and was so bad he couldn't even order a cup of coffee. \n\nHere's where it gets.... Not good. Very not good. He eventually found his way back to his apartment complex. And if I'm understanding correctly, he was shirtless and shoeless in the dead of mid-west winter at this point. This is what he told me over video call (for whatever reason he likes video calling). He took the license plate off a woman's car while she was still in it. When she asked what he was doing all he said was that he needed it, before sprinting away with it. He made it to the apartment complex's club house, and pulled a handicapped sign out of the ground then used it to break into the club house. Once inside the club house, still with the licence plate he stole, he called 911 on two different phones. The police show up to arrest him, duh, and he then resisted arrest. He showed me all the scrapes and bruises he has. They had to have multiple cops help put him into the back of the car. At some point his hand got twisted and badly hurt, he can not move his hand properly at this time. So because he wasn't (and possibly still isn't) in his right mind he thought that the police turning his head to try and force him into the car, was them trying to kill him to \"cover up\" .... Something? \n\nSo after arresting Ex, they took him to a mental hospital and not jail or anything like that. He is now out of the hospital as his parents took him out. Throughout our relationship and the \"friendship\"\/coworker relationship after, I had been insisting he got professional mental help but his narcissism wouldn't have it. He is still showing signs of mental instability. Tomorrow will be his first day back at work and I'm concerned about working near him again. I've already decided to talk to associate resources about being uncomfortable and feeling unsafe working near him. Am I the asshole for hoping he gets either moved by associate resources or fired for having 2 no-call-no-shows?\n\nTL;DR - am I the asshole for wanting my mentally unstable ex boyfriend to get moved at our job so that I don't have to work with him as he makes me feel unsafe?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AmItheAsshole","subreddit_subscribers":553155,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA for wanting my ex to get transfered or fired at work?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/alvzqd\/aita_for_wanting_my_ex_to_get_transfered_or_fired\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

I'm more than happy to discuss what we'll include, and pretty much anything else can be on the table!\n\nFor example, want to transform my husband into a woman, and force me to watch her get knocked up?

Maybe even make my dad get me pregnant? Hell yeah! Wanna inject me with a serum that causes my tits to grow bigger, the more cum I take in increasing their size?

This is a long one AND a doozy! so I just really need any, ANY outside, unbiased feedback on this because it\u2019s been bothering me for almost 2 years. I know I probably broke at least two moral codes here but then it all spun out of control and now I\u2019m just hurt and confused. so it starts alllll the way back in freshman year of high school (I\u2019m a freshman in college now). I befriend this guy, we\u2019ll call him A. A, at the time had a girlfriend whom we will call C. C and I aren\u2019t close at all, our only connection is that I\u2019m best friends with her boyfriend and we all have one class together. Deep down, I really like A but I don\u2019t want to get between him and C so I decide to just brush it off, keep our friendship intact, and find love elsewhere. \n\n\nNow A and C....were not good for each other. A is an immature 15 year old who isn\u2019t the best at being faithful and lies a lot and C is 18 with a bit of a control and manipulation problem. So they\u2019re off and on for quite a long time but I still don\u2019t wanna budge in between them. This goes on until A and I are both juniors and C is in her freshman year of college so I don\u2019t have any contact with her. At this point, they\u2019ve broken up and gotten back together so many times, I completely lost track of the timeline of their relationship when A confesses his feelings for me. I said I liked him too, but I immediately asked how long him and C had been broken up. He said it had been a couple months now and it was permanent this time. He broke all contact with her....or so I thought. So A and I decided to try on the relationship for size but just on the down low (red flag....I know....) and it was going pretty great for a couple of days until C out of the blue contacts A because she was experiencing a personal emergency and the only person she could think to contact was him. To this day, I have no idea what went on over there or how this came up, but A fessed up that him and I had been trying out dating. C...FLIPS. She screams at him and blocks him on everything and for the first time in forever she texts me, reprimanding me for dating her ex a WEEK, not 2 months like A had told me, but a WEEK after they had broken things off and then blocks me before I could get a word in. \n\n\nSo....this time they\u2019re officially done forever and we keep dating, despite me saying we should break things off. But somehow A keeps roping me back in despite my efforts to try to right this wrong and end things with him. at this point in our relationship, he was the one who grew to be very manipulative and a bit emotionally abusive and I eventually found myself unable to leave even if I wanted to. But my dumbass self still loved him so much. He wasn\u2019t just my boyfriend, he was my best friend of 3 years. And before me, he was dating such a beautiful, beautiful girl and by some magic grace of god, he chose me....and again....so I thought \n\n\n....So he cheats on me with C. For the whole first 6 months of our relationship, C being very aware of our choice to stay together. She sends me some screenshots, says fuck you, and leaves again. I\u2019m distraught. I\u2019m destroyed. I\u2019m heartbroken. I relapsed back into my eating disorder and my depression, I gave up on school and all my passions, my reproductive health was a mess and I was deemed totally and completely infertile because of the \u201cphysical\u201d \ud83e\udd2e aspect of his cheating. Overall, I\u2019m a wreck. I go about 8 months without saying anything, just completely bottling up my emotions and my hurt. Until finally, in a state of manic courage, I confronted C and told her how much she had hurt me and how whenever she went online saying \u201cwoe is me, my ex boyfriend left me\u201d, she completely glossed over the fact that she had knowingly helped my boyfriend cheat on me, and caused me all of that mess up there ^^  she then, instead of responding to me, makes a BIG post calling me ugly, worthless, stupid, and disgusting, you know, all that lovely stuff. She makes a post like that everyday for a month. She stalks all my social media just for ammo to make another nasty post about me, even goes so far as to go to our high school graduation (she had a sister in my grade), look for and spot me in the crowd, and makes as many comments ridiculing me and bullying me online as she can. At this point, I am 17. She is 20......wtf man.......\n\nSo! You\u2019re still here, huh? What a read, amirite? \nHere\u2019s the TLDR: \n\nI\u2019m best friends with this girls boyfriend, he\u2019s really manipulative and a huge cheater and loves to lie, so I thought by the time I dated him they had already been broken up for a couple months, she helps him lie to me and cheat on me, I tell her how she made me feel, she dedicates every waking moment of her life to writing hurtful, mean posts about me and obsessively stalks me so she can have more fuel for her posts. \nI know it was idiotic of me to just believe A when he said that him and C had been broken up for that long and I should have let her know about her ex\u2019s attempt to date me and double check with her despite our not being close. But...was that response from her really warranted? You decide! :D \n\n\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AmItheAsshole","subreddit_subscribers":553159,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA for confronting the other woman about infidelity?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/alw4si\/aita_for_confronting_the_other_woman_about\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

I'm 22. I listen to punk music. I skate, and I\u2019m pretty good at it. I wear hoodies: it's all the rage. \r\n\r\nShe looks so hot. My god. She's really busy; coffee doesn't serve itself and the line is only getting longer. It's 5pm, so the stiffs are heading in for a latte to go before they hit the trains. Her arms move mechanically. She's incredibly good at her job, especially seeing as she's only been here a month. I can't take my eyes off her. Dark hair in a ponytail, pouty lips that seem slightly too big for her face - and it's so hot - deep brown eyes, thin, square glasses always dropping down to the tip of her nose. \r\n\r\nThere she goes, pushing them up again with her right index finger. Just seeing that innocent face makes me hard. I don't think she's noticed me. \r\n\r\nI finish another cup of\u2026 what is it? Grande caramel latte with a double shot of espresso. $6.45! It's a bloody outrage for 300 milliliters of hot milk and coffee beans. \r\n\r\nNo. I don't care about money; that's right. And it's all the rage, coffee. And she makes it worth it. \r\n\r\nHer shift must nearly be over; I can see her looking over at the clock now and then. Has she noticed me yet? I don't think so. It's almost weird that she hasn't. But she's been really busy. I've read every little bit of this paper, back and forth. I bloody read obituaries. Should I read those? \r\n\r\n\u2026Would I? \r\n\r\nShe gets off at 6. \r\n\r\nNot long now. \r\n\r\nI'm Alex. \r\n\r\nThere she goes. Green apron off, same jeans, same dark shirt. She probably won't shower \u2018til she gets home. Her glasses are still there; and her ponytail. When you see it you just want to\u2026 yank it. Pull it towards you like it's a rope and bite her neck while you\u2026 \r\n\r\nShe's out the door. I get up and fold my newspaper. I leave it for someone else to read. \r\nNo. I stop, look at the paper, grab it and drop it on the floor instead. There. Hah! Not a care in the world. Not tonight. Tonight is the culmination of weeks of planning. \r\n\r\nShe's about 40 metres ahead of me; I stay locked in that range. She walks into the mall; lingers by a shop window, stares at the Sea Folly models. Come on, bitch! Move! Her mouth opens a bit as she looks up at one of them; poster girl is sitting knee deep in azure\u2026 in blue. Knee deep in really blue water. She's staring into the camera with a look that rests easily somewhere between seductive and tired. Like she's saying \"it's been a long day at the beach, Mister Photographer; I'm tired. I need some rest. And it's so lonely in that big, old bed of mine\u2026\" \r\n\r\nShe's off. I follow her down the escalator to the trains. It's spectacularly full, commuters everywhere. I'm stuck behind some idiot standing dead still in the middle of the escalator when everyone else have lined up to the left. Everyone! \"Oooh, I'll just wait here - so much space on both sides and in front of me! Fantastic!\" I resist a strong urge to punch the dickhead in the neck. I cough a couple of times and gently nudge into him. He doesn't move. I'm furious. I have people behind me looking at me as if it's my fault this guy is a commuting disaster! I look at the people behind with my arms raised in defeat but all I meet is anger. I quickly put my arms back down. I'm Alex. I don't back down! I lean into the dickhead again, and as I'm about to say something fitting, the stairs flatten and I touch ground. I push past him so he stumbles a bit. He's made me lose my target. If I wasn't so damn focused I guarantee you I'd have followed that dickhead home instead. And I would've taught him escalator protocol. \r\n\r\n\"It starts with attitude!\" I shout to him in my head, fists pounding into his meaty freshman face. \"You think you're so cool because you don't care!? I'll make you care!\" This laissez-faire crap kids these days have adopted gets to me. I don't know where it starts, but someone has to be held responsible. They can't not give a damn so thoroughly unless someone's told them to. But it's all the bloody rage these days, looking at life as a casual halfway home where you can fuck off everyone \"because after all: you know everything, don't you!\" \r\n\r\nBut Alex\u2026 Would Alex know everything? \r\n\r\nAlex would. \r\n\r\nI'm standing still. I've indulged my fantasies of reprimand so much that I have no idea where I am. A woman is in front of me in a dark coat. \"Hello? Are you okay?\" I look around. I'm on the wrong platform. Coffee Girl is on the level beneath! I look at my watch; 6:13. I have four minutes. The woman is still talking to me. God, she looks like a toad. Fat, flat face with acne. Who has acne at 45! And her hair\u2026 awful. I shudder and look at her like she's something I should scrape off my shoes. \r\n\r\nMy Globes. \r\n\r\nMy kicks! \r\n\r\nTwo minutes. I turn and make a run for it down the escalators, slipping through the closing doors of a train. \r\n\r\nShe's nowhere to be seen, not in my carriage, not in the others. I pace back and forth, cool trickles of sweat down my back pissing me off. I might not even be on the correct train! My watch says 6:18 but it could be any goddamn line, what with all their delays and problems and\u2026 And the carriage info displays are stuck on \"Next station Flag street\"\u2026 But you just left Flag street! If I have to go home empty-handed tonight I'm writing an official complaint to\u2026-! What? No. Jesus, no\u2026! \r\n\r\nI'm Alex. I won't write, I'll graf it on a wall. I'm 22. I listen to punk. I skate. \r\n\r\nA calming voice tugs me out of my head again. \"Next stop Croxton Hill.\" I didn't even realise I'd been lost for that long. Lucky those words penetrated otherwise I wouldn't have gotten off til-\u2026 I don't know what the end of the line is, that\u2019s not me, I don't care. I get out and look around: Hordes of people going every which way. I can't see her anywhere. What if she wasn't on the train at all! The whole day would've been a waste - all those bloody coffees, all those obituaries\u2026 \r\n\r\nA ponytail. There she is, almost lost in the sea of people. Her head moves in my direction, so I quickly turn around as she passes. My pulse is racing. I wait till there's about 100 foot between us again. \r\n\r\nAnd I start walking. \r\n\r\nShe takes a familiar route. I'm counting numbers on the houses. She lives in number 67, but she's only at 33. The street is empty and she looks to be the only one from the train who lives down here. I pick up the pace. She's at 57, I'm at 53. She changed shoes at work. I hadn't noticed. They click on the pavement. There are no streetlights except for the little streams from the neighbours' kitchens. She's at 63. I'm at 61. She's got a steady pace. Click - clack - click - clack - click - clack. She can't have noticed me; she would've picked up the pace if she had. Now she's at 65. I'm between 65 and 63, I'm walking faster, but quietly. I'm wearing sneakers. \r\n\r\nSkate shoes. \r\n\r\nKicks! Fuck! \r\n\r\nShe pulls out her keys. Click - clack - click. 67. I'm at 67. As she pushes the door open I ram into her from behind, shoving the Ikea rack in the hallway over. The lights are off and she lets out a scream as I slam the door shut behind me. I press her down into the floor with my right hand and knee while my left muffles her mouth. I land on top of her. I'm in a frenzy. I pull those skinny blue jeans down to reveal a white, frilly g-string. Oh my god, it can't get much better than this. I start pulling my belt off with my right hand, my knee firmly placed in her lower back to stop her from getting up. She's screaming something different now. It sounds like a name. My concentration breaks and I stop: \u201cRichard!\u201d \r\n\r\nShe's screaming \u201cRichard\u201d. \r\n\r\nI take my hand off her face, my knee slides off her back and I pull her over. \"My head!\" She's pointing to her temple. \"I can't! My head is\u2026 it hurts!\" \r\n\r\nI look at her in disgust. \"Your head\u2026? Look at me! Look. At. Me! Do I break character?!\" I shout. \"Huh? This isn't just about you!\" \r\n\r\n\"But I have a migraine\u2026\" she whimpers. \r\n\r\n\"I don't fucking care about your migraine!\u201d I continue. \u201cI'm Alex! And I'm about to - \" \r\n\r\nI'm lost for words. What am I about to do? Rape her? Rape my\u2026 girlfriend? She pulls herself up and leans against the wall. She looks for her glasses; they've landed next to me. \"This fantasy of yours isn't healthy\u2026\" she mutters as she grabs the spectacles and puts them on. I'm confused. I say nothing. I'm still holding my belt but I'm on my knees looking around, fly open. \r\n\r\nI feel ashamed. I'm Richard. I'm 35. I like Blur and The Smiths. I can't skate. \r\n\r\n\"I'll make us some tea\", she mumbles and gets on her feet. \"We can try again some other time maybe.

He's 70, I'm 27, so I'm naturally on the opposite side and I believe we need to be concerned with the amount of CO2 we're putting out. I'm not great at debating so I mostly only have feelings and not facts. I know a lot of scientists recently got together and warned the government about climate change, I know a massive majority of scientists are concerned about climate change, etc, but I don't know lots of good specifics. My dad listens to radio stations like Hannity and watches Fox, if I had to guess, probably around two hours every day if not more. He is REALLY certain that he is in the right, and when trying to convince me that he's right he will go on to explain how information is being twisted and it's all being done so the government can tax people etc.\n\nIt would be nice if I could change his mind, but I don't expect that to be a realistic goal. He's old, he's going to believe in what he believes in, and I'm okay with that. I mostly just want a better understanding for myself since he's actively trying to gaslight me (I'm in close quarters doing work with him most days lately).\n\nOut of curiosity, I asked him if I could see his sources. He gladly said he would email them to me. I thought I would get some obscure alternative science sources, but I got one singular source from [Fox Fucking News, linked here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fA5sGtj7QKQ) The guy's name is Dr. Patrick Michaels, not sure if that name sounds familiar to anyone.\n\nI don't know if this is relevant since it's about 5 years old now but I recently reviewed [Veritasium's video on this](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OWXoRSIxyIUhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OWXoRSIxyIU) and I agree with most of the points he's laid out. I'm taking lots of this with grains of salt: \n\nI'm not taking either video as an absolute truth of course, just wanted to see where he was coming from. I really don't trust Fox, and to a large extent I don't trust most mainstream news either. I don't even trust myself and I'm not sure I can trust reddit at this point. Obviously if I'm posting on the climatechange subreddit it's going to favor younger people who believe climate change is a real danger, so I don't know sometimes if the information I'm getting is biased or if there is real truth to what I'm reading. I worry that I'm so scared of things being Fake News that I just end up rejecting everything I'm given sometimes. \n\nBasically, I don't know where to even start with something as complicated as this, was wondering if anyone could point me in the right (IE probably correct) direction?

It turns out he had been a sperm donor and I'm guessing that's what happened. I forgot to say that I knew I was from IVF, but they never told me that used a donor.

I don't remember what happened after that but I do remember sitting down to watch a bill burr stand up to lighten my mood. Then I must've went upstairs and tried to relax.

This was a very traumitizing experience for me. Sorry for any fortmatting issues, im typing this on mobile, and im new to reddit, so sorry if I mess things up) Also, this will be a bit long, so there is a short version in the end.\n\nEM - Entitled mother\nEC - Entitled children\nM - My mom\nMe - Explanitory\nP1-4 - Policemen 1-4\n\nBackground: My mom and I (7 years old) was on a trip to New Mexico to pick up our new dog named Bubbles, who was a Rottweiler; however, that is not important, and I'll go straight to the story.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This story is a bit slow. But beware, you are hearing about someone that needs to be in solitary confinement. I am also a first timer, gotta learn :)\n\nWe were in the middle of a neighborhood, and M wasn't feeling to good, but there wasn't a store or public property that has a bathroom in sight. Luckily, while driving, we saw a small park, with a bathroo. So M parked, and hastily led me to the park to play. There was another mom (EM) around, with eight. E I G H T. Children with her. (EC) My mom trusted that as a fellow mother she would step in in case I got hurt, and she thought the other kids would play with me.\n\nShe. Was. Wrong. Badly wrong.\n\nI was a timid wee child, and an introvert. So was my mom, she avoided confrontations as much as possible. I got on the play place building thingy. (Idek what its called, you can bite me in the ass for it in the comments) It took me a while to get the courage to talk to the eight kids on the play place. I went up to one of the kids. Me: Hi, I'm *me*, what's your name? (I'm 13 now, so I don't remember exact datails) EC: I'm *EC*. Before I said anything else, he claimed that I was bullying him. EC: Stop bullying me. Me: Wat? The bastard goes down to his mom or supervisor. He must be the \"leader\", because everybody else follows him down. I watched them, and I saw the mother give me the glare the entire time. I thought she would try to ask me what I did, but she assumed that what her little angles said was true, because apparently all eight brats said I was being a big mean bully. She calmy got up and calmly and politely asked me to come down. EM: Please come down here. I was a bit intimidated, as she was pretty... Above average in the size category. I hesitated and didn't move. Apparently that triggered something in her brain. EM: Get. Down. Here... NOW. I reluctantly walked my way down. I was a good 5 feet away from her. EM: Get. Closer. I have something to say. I despacitoed my way closer. She put her mouth up to my ear, and she LOST. IT. I don't know what asshole would scream directly into a childs ear, but apparently she was one. EM: WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOUR DOING TO MY LITTLE PEARLS. (Keep in mind the bathroom was rather far from the play place) I immediately started bawling my eyes out. I also wonder why she would cuss in front of children. Welp, EM are gonna be EM. Behind her outroar I could see those asshats with their smug grins. Every single one of them. EM: You little shit! Where are your parents? What a horrible son you are! Absolute peice of shit! I pointed to the bathroom, while covering my eyes with my other arm. I was shaking like crazy. She definitely saw me pointing, she couldnt have missed it. None the less, she countinued. EM: I'll need to put some fucking discipline in you! Get over here. BEND DOWN FUCKER. I kid you not, she was about to spank me. Some random lady, with her little satans laughing in the background, was going to spank me! Thankfully, oh my god, I am so thankful M walked out and saw the yelling. She rushed over and asked what was going on. M: What's going on, why are you yelling? EM: Your peice of shit for a child was bullying my children! M: What!?!? What happened, what did he do!?!? I will make sure to give him a talk about it! EM: Go on *EC*, tell this bitch what her son did. The children were lost for words. Their tiny brains couldn't think up of anything except \"He punched *Insert one of the EC names here*!\" EM: WHAT!?!?!? EM started freaking out. It took M no time to figure out it was a lie. She knows I would never do that. EM: GET OVER HERE YOU RACIST n-word (Note: My mom and I are white, EM and EC were black) M: Excuse me, you cant say that around my son, and stop yelling at him so we can figure this out peacefully. EM juat yelled at me and M. It would cause a scene, but we were the only ones there. I can't remember if someone was looking out their window watching the whole thing. EM: YOU ARE A HORRIBLE BITCH. I WILL CALL THE POLICE RIGHT NOW AND I WILL SUE YOUR ASS. I WILL MAKE YOU AND YOUR SON SUFFER. Is this lady severly retarted? M: We don't want to cause any trouble, we will be going now. M grabs me, and is about to start walking, but then EM said \"STOP OR I WILL SHOOT YOU.\" She hasnt pulled out a gun, but my doesn't want to risk anything. This has gone WAYYY too far. My mom holds me tighter, and pushed me behind her back. (I swear I am not making this up) My mom takes out her phone and calls the police, not taking her eye of EM. EM: Yeah, call the police, see where that will get you. EM tells EC to lay on the ground, and then she gets on the ground themselves. The police arrive very quickly. Four policemen come out of two cars. They run with their guns out (M told P about being threatened) EM: ARREST THOSE TWO, THEY THREATENED ME AND MY CHILDREN! THEY HAVE A GUN! THEY TOLD US TO GET ON THE GROUND AND NOT TO MOVE. P1 pointed their gun at M while P2 grabbed me away from my mom. P2-3 still pointing at EM. P1: GET ON THE GROUND, NOW! M obliged. As she was handcuffed she tried to explain the situation. As she was, EM said \"SHE IS LYING! SHOOT HER! SHOOT THE KID!\" P3: Shut up. Im going to skip ahead a bit, cause this si getting TOO long. My mom explains, they found an unregistered handgun on EM. They also found that she had multiple crimes in the past. We were asked questions, and EM was arrested in the end. Don't know what happened after that, and I don't know what ahppened to the kids.\n\n\nTHIS MAY SOUND A LITTLE MADE UP. Some of it might be. I dont remember every detail, so I filled it in with something that could have led up to the next event that I remembered. Thanks for reading.\n\nShort version: Went to a park, accused of bullying, crazy EM yelled at me and tried to spank me, mom defends me, EM threatens to pull out gun, gets arrested.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"entitledparents","subreddit_id":"t5_358dh","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/entitledparents","subreddit_subscribers":409748,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Randomly accused of bullying","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/entitledparents\/comments\/alwgin\/randomly_accused_of_bullying\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH ANOTHER YEAR FEELING LIKE THIS. PLEASE HELP!\n\nSome background: I'm 5'10\", 32yrs, male, 275lbs. I lost a lot of weight when I was around 20 - went from 303 to 164 in about a year and a half. I felt so IN CONTROL then, but the weight has come back and I can't seem to do anything about it. I don't know if my body has changed or I just don't remember how I did it the first time well enough, or what. But the best I can seem to do is hold steady until something throws me off, then I gain a few pounds and that's the new floor.\n\nSo I'm reaching out to the community here for some crowdsourced encouragement and rules for the road. Thoughts on the following statements:\n\n(1) If I maintain my calories to 1500 a day, I should lose weight. Right?\n\n(2) I can budget those calories out over the course of a few days - so that I'm having Maybe 2000 one day and 1250 the next two days. Is that right? I'm trying to figure out how to do this without limiting myself too much in social situations because I just moved to a new city and I'm feeling socially isolated right now.\n\nAny other thoughts? Things that have helped folks here? I know that the name of the game is slow and steady - but I also feel like I need to see some success soon to keep me moving because I'm just feeling so discouraged right now.\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"loseit","subreddit_id":"t5_2rz8w","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/loseit","subreddit_subscribers":1517219,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Tired of living like this - looking for help.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/alwgvo\/tired_of_living_like_this_looking_for_help\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

For a long time I convinced myself that the job was a good deal, it's flexible and I have a lot of leverage as they rely on me heavily. But this feels like a long time coming, and it's hitting me all at once that wow, I really need to quit. \n\nThe management of my job is really dysfunctional, I'll get passive aggressive texts at night when I'm home, and theres been a lot of things I'd consider 'strikes'. Recently, the job has been destroying me physically, and I'm seeing a doctor soon and considering using it as my way out of this job. Everyone in my life tells me I should quit.\n\nThe thing is, I'm terrified to quit. When I leave, I don't know how they'll manage. That isn't me trying to toot my own horn, it will really be difficult for them. But I've given them all I possibly can.  I think I also fear their reaction, they will go ballistic. I'm also just absolutely terrified of changing my life this way.  I've had this job for 3 years, I've settled into it. I haven't had to do anything truly uncomfortable or this life changing in a long time. I'm scared! But I know the older I get, the harder it will be. I live at home and have savings, I'm not on my own with all these bills to pay. I have this 'cushion' and a supportive family so I don't know why I'm so scared. \n\nAny advice for taking that leap of faith would be really appreciated. I've already applied to a new job, so I know I'm planning on doing this no matter what, but I'm just trying to accept it, and it's been extremely hard. I thought I could wait it out because there's a lot going on in my life right now, but I think it's looking like this is an all at once deal.\n\nSo if anyone has any experience changing their life, quitting their job, and taking a risk, I'd be happy to hear.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"jobs","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhnd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/jobs","subreddit_subscribers":216772,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I'm terrified to leave my job, and change my life","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/jobs\/comments\/alwj6y\/im_terrified_to_leave_my_job_and_change_my_life\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

I'm 17 and hes 24, except I'm moving my life forward and about to go to the Marines and he's living off my mom and dad. He's so lazy that he's not even trying to find a job and isn't going to college, and comes to me and my brothers job on weekends to fill a spot because it's the most convenient thing for him, because apparently it's so difficult to go online and look for a job. I tell his lazy ass daily to go out and look for one and to go to college at least even if my parents have to pay for it and he gets mad and goes running to tell my parents, almost like a 4 year old. Hes been living here for about a year now because previously he lived with my sisters and worked for like a year but he wasn't even going to college then and just lived with roommates and thought that was a huge step in his life..... Today once more I told him to get off his ass and get a job but this time he runs upstairs and tries breaking my $400 guitar and $200 piano, and then I just take his phone (he has 3 other ones) and he lunges at me with his weak little limbs trying to hurt me but I just pin him down. In the process of doing so I got a lip bleed and several carpet burns but I did not hurt him physically at all well because he's autistic and I'm not going to fucking punch an autistic dude. And then he says he's going to kill himself because of me and then told everyone his version of the story. If I don't tell him daily to get a job he won't get one and will continue living off my parents like he is right now, but he perceives it as bullying. Honestly he puts my parents under so much stress with his antics and threatening to kill himself every now and then that at this point I don't even care if he does it or not anymore because then he won't be a problem anymore. This stupid idiot is taking advantage of my parents love to live with them as long as he can. He literally can't do anything for himself and my mom still cooks for him, and when shes not there to do it he buys fast food from the grocery store. I'm not an expert cook but I at least can cook for myself when I need to. Telling him to do something with his life is apparently offensive to him and he thinks it's bullying... Extremely ironic, considering he's 24 and isn't even going to a community college or working, or making any efforts to do so. He is so God damn annoying and you can't ever have a conversation with him because he talks about literally the dumbest shit you could imagine and that's not an exaggeration, and the worst part is that my parents defend his actions. This is a throwaway account so I don't care what I say on here.

It is a bit long winded but worth it if you like unexpected endings. I am 3 IPAs deep in an airport bar while writing this, so please excuse the brevity, as I\u2019m typing on a tiny little keyboard. Here it goes...\n\nI live in the northeast and flew down to New Orleans for work on Monday afternoon. I was supposed to get in around 12pm but because of all the snow storms, I got in later at night and missed some important meetings. Tuesday I had both of my flights cancelled because of storms and I was stuck in New Orleans Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Needless to say I wasn\u2019t too happy. \n\nOn Tuesday night, I went to dinner on bourbon street by myself at a seafood place and sat at the bar. As soon as my appetizer arrives, a beautiful woman (About 40 years old, I\u2019m 30) sits down next to me. Normally, I would say hello and put some subtle moves on her and be all suave and such but...I was so exhausted from the day I thought \u201cEh, I\u2019m just gonna eat and go home.\u201d\n\nShe asks me what I\u2019m eating\/drinking and the next thing you know, we sit there for about two hours talking about almost everything...enjoying a few beers together and bonding over our shared love of Parks and Rec and Whiskey. \n\nAs I\u2019m getting ready to leave, I told her I\u2019m going to go over to the Jazz club down the street. She says \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying we should go together...\u201d\n\nI\u2019m like \u201cUh...Yes! I would love for you to join me!\u201d We leave the restaurant together. \n\nI\u2019m a single guy and I feel like I can tell when a girl is \u201cinto\u201d me...she was. This was great. This wasn\u2019t just a random tinder hookup situation. This was a funny, mature, intelligent woman of substance who sat right down next to me. I felt so lucky and fortunate to be in the right place at the right time. This is almost too good to be true...\n\nOn the way there we get distracted by a karaoke bar and we go in. We have a few more drinks, laugh and continue the general awesomeness. I end up going on stage to sing \u201cThe Middle\u201d by Jimmy Eat World (Classic song). \n\nAs soon as I get off stage, she grabs me by the waist, pulls me into her and kisses me. Hard. Passionately. Wow.\n\nThe turns into a full-on make-out session at the bar. I say \u201chang on, let\u2019s go upstairs to the balcony so we can have a bit more privacy.\u201d We rush upstairs. \n\nWe\u2019re all alone upstairs, giggling and smiling at each other. I grab her, we kiss and share and incredibly romantic moment together that seemed to last forever. Sparks were flying. Everywhere. This is unreal!\n\nNow, I travel a lot for work and have dated all over (tinder and bumble one night\/two night stands primarily, so I had somewhat of an idea of how this night could ultimately end up) and I feel like I know when the right time is to \u201cclose the deal\u201d, so I ask her...\u201dHey, do you wanna come back to my place and have a glass of wine?\u201d\n\nShe exhales and says \u201cNo, I probably shouldn\u2019t.\u201d She goes oddly silent.\n\nI say \u201cOh, ok. That\u2019s a bummer but no problem at all! Is it something that I said, or did? I\u2019m sorry if I moved the needle a bit too quick.\u201d\n\nShe said \u201cNo it\u2019s not you...it\u2019s just that...I\u2019m married.\u201d \n\nUtterly Confused, I look down at her finger, and there\u2019s no ring. I look back up at her, still confused. Slightly embarrassed, she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a diamond ring. My jaw hit the MOTHER FUCKING floor. \n\nJesus tap-dancing Christ, what did I just witness? I\u2019m making out with another man\u2019s wife. I\u2019m an ethical guy. I may be a single dude open to a hookup here and there but I would NEVER knowingly do something like go after a married woman. \n\nI just look at her and start chuckling at myself, bewildered at the situation I just found myself in. Shaking my head...Is this real life? Or am I that drunk?\n\nI say to her \u201cwow, uhhhh I don\u2019t really know what to say....\u201d I just stand there confused and unsure of what to do.\n\nShe leans in and kisses me again. And again. And again. She hugs me and continues to kiss me. I succumb to her seduction and just take her lead. Why the hell not, at this point. I\u2019m making out with a beautiful woman. That\u2019s a W in my book.\n\nShe stops between kisses and says to me \u201cSomeday you are going to make a beautiful girl so happy. You will be an incredible mate. You are a wonderful person and to be honest, what happened tonight is going to stick with me for a long time. I didn\u2019t expect this at all and I\u2019ve never done this before. I\u2019ve been married to the man of my dreams for almost twenty years.\u201d Although she deceived me from the start, I believe her.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to say. Obviously, if a woman doesn\u2019t want to sleep with me, it\u2019s her choice. Plain and simple. I\u2019m man enough to understand that. I\u2019m not about to pressure her or tell her that she \u201cowes it to me\u201d or something. Every guy I know has been turned down at the end of the night at least once before. However, This situation felt different to me. \n\nI said the only thing that I could think of...\u201dThank you for a wonderful night. I just hope that the man in your life treats you as well as you deserve to be treated. I wish I could treat you right tonight. You are so beautiful...\u201d\n\n\u201cHe does, and I\u2019m sorry to let you down like this.\u201d she said.\n\nI look at the ground, sigh, gave her one final kiss and said goodnight. I turn around as fast as possible and started walking away with a heavy heart and a bruised ego. A homeless man saw my frown and told me to cheer up because I\u2019m in New Orleans and I should lighten up! I faked a smile and continued my walk back to my Airbnb. I\u2019ve never been in a situation like this before and to be honest, it hurt in the few hours that followed.\n\nI felt like shit yesterday thinking about it...I couldn\u2019t get it out of my head. I mean, I was making out with another man\u2019s wife...But...at the same time, she made the big move and kissed me first. She sat down next to me at dinner. She deliberately took her ring off before she met me and pretended to be single to get my attention. \n\nNow, after the dust has settled, I\u2019ve come to a sort of conclusion on this. I feel that I may have provided a bit of an escape for her. I was her opportunity to live a bit of a more exciting life during her normal everyday existence. Perhaps she is secretly unhappy in her marriage and I was her one secret that she can keep to herself...Maybe her experience with me will give her the confidence in herself to go after what truly makes her happy. strangely, I think I\u2019m ok with that. Or maybe she was just horny and wanted to make out with a younger dude.\n\nI will never see her again so unfortunately I will never find out.\n\nAll I have to say is...New Orleans, you\u2019re insane. I won\u2019t soon forget this trip.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"offmychest","subreddit_id":"t5_2ranw","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/offmychest","subreddit_subscribers":1178725,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"A night in New Orleans","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/offmychest\/comments\/alwsma\/a_night_in_new_orleans\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

For some reason, this is terrifying to me, even if I have been functioning with it for a while. It would definitely make sense though, and would answer some questions I have for a while. My psychiatrist is weaning me off Pristiq and onto Lamictal twice a day. I have some qualms about being off an SSRI or SNRI since I've been on them for a long time, but my doctor and I both have a hunch that they never really worked in the first place. He hasn't officially diagnosed me yet- he said there's a possibility that the hypomania is substance-induced from the antidepressants so we're playing it by ear.\n\nAlthough I've had an eating disorder and have had MDD and GAD for years now, this possibility is shaking me up a little bit. I'm 20 years old and a double major at university in the pre-med program. I'm terrified this is going to derail my plans or isolate me from my family and friends. I know deep down that its just finally putting a name to what I've been going through and the stigma being attached to it and it sucks that its that way but it is. I've always been open with my friends and family about my mental health issues since they've been going on since middle school, but something new like this seems harder to explain because it's less \"main-stream\" than depression and anxiety have become in recent years.\n\nI guess I was just wondering if anyone was originally diagnosed for years with MDD and then discovered it was really BP2? Also, if anyone has been weaned off an antidepressant onto a medicine like Lamictal? I've been taking it 25mg twice a day for 3 days and haven't had any major side effects ( but I've also had the flu since Tuesday). \n\nThank you all so much in advance. I'm so glad I found this page.

I grew up in an Arabic family, who's only way of life was running gas stations, liquor stores, and smoke shops and never had the support to pursue it due to 80+ hour weeks. During my years of working the family stores, and even owning one of my own I did attempt to go to university completing 12 units of CJ realizing that was a struggle with the hours in our businesses. I have mostly branched away from the family and the practices, and even sold off my own business giving me more free time then ever before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy questions are as follows, firstly, I was always very anti-weed, and alcohol due to the mild altering effects. I just never liked it. My brother's always been a stoner, and recently with a not so easy separation from my wife and children I admittedly finally did cave and tried it maybe close to a dozen times. I know it depends on the outfit, but would that ever permanently DQ you?\n\nSecondly, the reason for selling off my business was the 18 to 21 age change in California for tobacco did make me take quite a hit sending business downhill to which I accumulated debt. Most all of the debt aside from one business loan of \\~$15,000.00  has been paid in full, however... I am behind on taxes, and I can imagine that could be seen as either irresponsibility, or a liability but truth of the matter is, I just plainly and simply could not and can not afford it at this point in time.\n\nLastly... I grew up on dirt bikes which at 17 years of age (I'm 27 now) transitioned into street bikes (crotch rockets), which did get me a fair number of speeding tickets throughout the years. The last one being back in 2014 which included exhibition of speed, illegal passing on the left, illegal passing on the right, and following too close. I have no intent on lying about any of the above especially due to knowing my choices were far from intelligent or safe, but do find it curious that for the better part of the year I've pulled my own DMV record 6 times, checked public records, searched local court databases by my DL #, full name and there is no record ANYWHERE of anything as though everything just disappeared.\n\nTo top it off, I used to pay a fortune for insurance, as most young males do. I pay less now than my mother whom has a spotless driving record and full coverage on 2 brand new vehicles on her policy whereas my policy consists of 2 brand new vehicles with full coverage, a vehicle with liability, a travel trailer with full coverage, and 2 street bikes which, naturally pisses her off but further shows even the insurance company doesn't see my driving record or else that would not be possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've never been arrested, or in any sort of trouble with the law aside from traffic infractions and the one misdemeanor (exhibition of speed).\n\nSo... I suppose my ultimate question with all of the information provided is this, should I even bother pursuing a career in LE or would I essentially be grasping at something unobtainable?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskLEO","subreddit_id":"t5_2yogd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AskLEO","subreddit_subscribers":14666,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Interested in a career as a LEO","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskLEO\/comments\/alwvz9\/interested_in_a_career_as_a_leo\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

I'm 34 and I wish I had put it all together so much sooner that my mom has BPD. I don't think I ever really appreciated just how unwell and manipulative and harmful she  is until recently; I guess I always just thought the level of drama and stress in our family was normal or maybe just bad luck, even though some pretty insanely abusive things happened. Some of it is unbelievable even to me when I put it into writing: when I was 13, she took my adolescent differentiation personally. In retaliation, she more or less completely emotionally abandoned me, which included allowing her friend who was living with us to regularly sexually assault me \\*with her knowledge and approval.\\* When I was 18 she held my college tuition over my head to force me to go to rehab \\*for a drug addiction that I did not have,\\* an experience that really screwed me up and made me feel crazy. How has it taken me this long to fully appreciate how completely dysfunctional that world is? How truly unmothered I have been for so long? \n\nAnyway, right now I am NC with her. Just about every year she picks out someone in her life to give an extra-special scapegoat treatment. Around Thanksgiving, she started scapegoating my sister, but then right around Christmas, something \"switched\" and I became the SG and my sister became the GC literally overnight. I got a long, gaslight-y email telling me never to come home to visit again and I just replied, \"I'm sorry you feel that way. I hope you start feeling better.\" I haven't spoken with her since then, although she has tried to reconnect with me, acting like nothing ever happened. I actually don't think I'm completely out of the FOG here though; a part of me still feels somehow responsible for the acrimony, like I could just suck it up one more time and things can be resolved. I especially feel guilty about my dad. I love him to death, but he values harmony above all else and just wants things to \"go back to normal\" (as if there is a normal in our family!). I guess I can't really blame him, because he lives with her (which must be hellish) and he just wants our family to be united. He has begged me to just apologize to my mom so we can put this episode behind us. I've explained that I just can't do what he's asking and still preserve my integrity, which he understands but the whole thing still just feels tragic.\n\nI guess at this stage I am writing just to try to understand more the experience of stepping out of the FOG and also how to navigate maintaining relationships with some members of my family while also protecting myself against these dynamics with my mom. If anyone has any feedback or experiences about any of that, I would appreciate the support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbyborderlines","subreddit_id":"t5_33d8b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbyborderlines","subreddit_subscribers":16281,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Finally coming to terms with all of this","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbyborderlines\/comments\/alwwuw\/finally_coming_to_terms_with_all_of_this\/","whitelist_status":"house_only","wls":1}

I have run my business for 3 years now, going into my 4th year, and it's time for me to really think about whether this is what I want to do for the rest of my life.\n\nGrowing up I never considered working in the trades. I was really good at school and am more academically-oriented, plus my mother always pushed me towards university and higher education. However, the way life circumstances fell, I ended up in drywall and here I am, 4 years later!\n\nThere are definite pros to my job. I love love LOVE being self employed. I really enjoy the physical work, as it keeps me somewhat fit and active. I have no debt whatsoever, and was able to get through a 2-year college business program owing no money and in fact accumulating savings throughout. \n\nI make about $40,000\/yr currently, but the important thing to note with this is that I work - basically - part time hours. I've had other obligations in the last few years (a second job waitressing, school, personal issues, and the mentality that someday I'll get a \"real job\") that caused me to not throw my whole effort at this business. But I've been thinking, and if I were to really buckle down, get serious, and take on a bigger workload, I could increase my earnings from $10K, 20K, I think potentially as much as $40K a year. With the shortage of skilled trades workers, I think future job security is pretty much guaranteed.\n\nSo why would I consider another career if the drywall has a promising future and so much potential to grow?\n\nI really do love learning. I enjoy intellectual subjects. If I were to go to university I want to study psychology, and get into addictions\/eating disorders\/etc counselling. My mom was\/is an alcoholic and I myself suffered from an eating disorder for a number of years, and I believe this line of work would be really meaningful and personally fulfilling.\n\nFrom what I understand and have researched, psychologists make upwards of $80K a year on average, and even starting salaries at $60K are nothing to turn your nose up at. That means a more comfortable life financially, which is important to me because I am single again and I don't have plans right now on ever settling down, so I need to be able to support myself.\n\nI would like to leave the province I am currently in and I feel that I could get a job as a psychologist anywhere in the country, whereas I'm not sure I have the gumption to restart my business again from scratch somewhere else. Sure, tapers are in demand everywhere too, but if  I stay in the trade, I do not want to be an employee of someone else.\n\nPsychology is not a physically taxing career, which would make a difference to my body as I age. If I were to ever get sick or hurt or otherwise suffer mobility issues, my job would not suffer as it would if I continue taping.\n\nI admit, there is a part of me that is considering school simply because it feels like the \"proper\" thing to do. The horror stories of my peers getting out of school with crippling debt and few job prospects are definitely a worry, but I believe psychology is a pretty specific career path and thus perhaps I wouldn't fall into that statistic. I would be saddled with a fair bit of debt, for sure, but my increased income would (hopefully) make it worthwhile.\n\nI'm very confused. I know I have to come to this decision on my own because it's my life and nobody else's, I'm just searching for some outside opinions. Any and all advice welcome.

They watch our kid one weekend and we take theirs the next so we each get two nights out a week. The kids love each other and have a blast playing together. \n\nLast Sunday was technically our turn but we hadn't confirmed by that Friday that we were on, which is the rule for not springing stuff last minute. Other kid's dad (let's say KD) pushed pretty hard because other kid (OK) was being a royal pain in the way only 2 year olds can be and they wanted my DS to help burn some energy off. We said sure, dropped DS off after nap and went to dinner. We barely get through dinner before getting a phone call saying DS fell, hurt his leg and won't stop crying for mom and dad. We get there and he is HOWLING in pain. He sobs into my chest as we examine his leg and try to figure out what happened. \n\nIt turns out no one saw what happened. They just saw OK and DS running around, then DS fell and when they got there OK was lying on top of him. OK is 36 lbs. My DS is only 26. DS refuses to walk on the leg so we rush to Urgent Care and they x Ray him. Turns out both bones in his right lower leg are fractured. He ends up in a splint for 3 days and has been in a cast for 2. He still won't walk on the leg although he's been cleared to do so, and I don't blame him. \nKD and the other kid's mom (KM) have been chiming in saying they feel so guilty and will help any way they can but what I need is physical support during the day since DS can't\/won't walk and carrying him around all day at 32 weeks pregnant is killing me. They can't do it since KM can't drive and she'd have to bring OK who would just run around and trash my house (which again is totally normal for two year olds but I don't need more mess to clean up).\n\nAdd on to that, logically I understand that accidents happen. They didn't do it on purpose of course not. But they still can't even tell me what happened which means neither of them even had eyes on the kids. I might let my own kid out of my sight in my own home but never someone else's child I am babysitting. \n\nAnd it is breaking my heart to see my super active son buckle in pain when he tries to stand, then cry because he doesn't understand what happened. He is very verbal and when we asked him what happened, he consistently without coaching answered \"OK pushed me. OK hurt me\". \nAll I have to give him for his broken leg is Motrin and I'm sure it helps but it also constipates him. And top it all off somehow poor DS caught a cold too. \n\nI am terrified to let KD and KM watch my son again, even though I know they want to continue the arrangement. OK is speech delayed, for reasons I have never asked about they're dragging their feet getting him into speech therapy. They like DS playing with OK because he talks to OK a lot and gets OK to produce more speech and not just babbling. \n\nThank you for reading to the end if you read all this. I just really want to vent and DH doesn't understand why I am so angry and upset. Me not just forgiving and forgetting is somehow not okay to him. He is a far better person than I am and has already forgiven KD and KM for the whole thing. Like I said logically I understand it's no one's fault. But I am 8 weeks away from having a baby, I am exhausted and I hurt all over and my heart is breaking every time my DS cries in pain. I am not logical. I am heartbroken and I do not have it in me to forgive right now.

But, like many people, the *exact* thing that seems most interesting varies from day to day. \n\nToday is definitely one of those days.\n\nI've tried posting individual ideas previously, but few have really ever worked out perfectly. So this sort of encompasses, well, everything.\n\nI don't really know what I'm trying to accomplish here, other than conveying what interests me about scenes like this, I guess. So, here we go.\n\n**I'd be happy to throw out a few specific plot ideas in PM!** I didn't really want to clog this up *too* much with yet another list...\n\n---\n\n- Generally, the scenes I like to write revolve around one thing; my wife fucking someone else. Sometimes this is by her request, but most of the time another mechanism is used to instigate the encounter, something like peer pressure, guilt, even blackmail. Other times, the surprise of a MMF threesome is a surprise gift to me, and even other times, it happens without my knowledge. Basically any of those options are appealing at any one time and, honestly, it sort of depends on what my partner prefers and is best at writing.\n\n- The general *feel* of the stories vary as well. Sometimes I'll really be feeling a rough, misogynistic, sort of depraved scene, where maybe she'll be passed around at a gathering like a party favor. Other times, I'll find interest in slow, passionate, almost romantic scenes, such as one where I push for a MMF threesome, and she almost starts falling for the other guy. I think the best scenes have a mix of both, but sometimes it's hard to find a middle ground.\n\n- I also really enjoy the elements of realism in scenes like this. So, I wouldn't want us to have been doing stuff like this for quite some time, or for the two of us to be completely different people, because that takes away from the realism\/personalism. The progression of our current relationship to something much more complicated\/sexual is most of the fun, though there's obviously wiggle room when we get into unknown territory, with some creative freedom.\n\n- Kinks. I have a lot. Limits? I have few. This is definitely something better discussed in PM, but I *love* working with 'first times.' First time anal, first time fucking someone else, first time in a group...etc. First times are *spectacular.* Let's talk more about these in private.\n\n---\n\nSo...that's it, I guess? I'm really looking for a partner interested in something longer term, descriptive, vivid, and memorable. I'll never ghost on you - as long as you promise the same - and I've always wanted to write something worthy of [Share] quality. If that sounds interesting to you, PM me. I'd love to talk to you.\n\nCheck out my history for some ideas, or PM me for a discussion\/brainstorming!\n\n**Edit:** I'm 26, by the way.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"dirtypenpals","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbbv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/dirtypenpals","subreddit_subscribers":160905,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"nsfw","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[M4A] I have like...a million ideas for a sort of cheating\/cuckolding roleplay, and no way to succinctly put them all into this title.

I had an ekg and xray done and they told me there was physically nothing wrong. The kind nurse said it was anxiety and all of a sudden it clicked.  \n\nSince then ive been to two doctors.

This lady was actually really creepy and after talking to a few friends from Highschool it sounds like she was just really creepy full stop, not just with guys she liked. So... enjoy.\n\n\\----------------------------------\n\nSo... I got a name for you. Stripperbeard. Here's the cast overall: Stripperbeard - a legbeard who doesn't look much like a legbeard. She was tall for a girl and thin. She'd constantly be wearing long, fishnet, stockings and hot pants that just barely met the minimum length for my school and matched those with red heals. She was caucasian and had long black hair that she'd lightly died red, giving a scarlet look to it. Myself - There's a picture of me in the irl-pics, please don't share it in the video if you read this one. I was clean shaven at the time though and I have a baby face, I was also bordering on obesity at the time. I'm autistic as well, so that could be a major factor as to why I didn't see the signs. Cyn - My best friend at the time. He used the name Cyn everywhere at the time, so that's why I used that name. We'd constantly come up with ideas for video games, films, and help each other with our writing. Though I'm not in contact with Cyn anymore, I'm grateful for the help he provided throughout my time with stripperbeard.\n\nI first met Stripperbeard in a creative writing class. See, what attracted me to her in a friendly manner was that our conversation actively went in strange directions. I didn't know that she was attracted to me, and even if I found her attractive I didn't have any romantic or overly sexual feelings for her. The most interesting thing we talked about was pole dancing, as the Olympic comity was debating whether or not it could be considered a sport. We actually agreed that it was due to the upper and lower body strength needed to do it. That was when she mentioned that she had a pole that she would use to dance with built into her bedroom with photographic proof of it. I thought it was cool and said so, but she insisted that I come over after class. I didn't know her well enough at the time, I should mention that our class was 3 hours and we'd been talking for most of the class (we had a half hour that was dedicated exclusively to writing where we couldn't talk), so we had a conversation that went from introductions, to pole dancing at the Olympics, to the fact that she herself pole danced. This was all in high school, I thought I should mentioned that before going any further. I'm 5 years out of highschool now, and I've only seen her once since, not in person, but I'll also get to that later.\n\nI'd continued to talk to stripperbeard for the next few months both during and outside of that class. When nobody else was around, she would start talking about more overtly sexual things, starting with talking about the porn that'd she watched the night before, then talking, in depth, about hentai series and the lore of some of her favorites, and then moving on to her sexual fantasies. This took place over the course of a few months. She'd never talk about overtly sexual things around other people and would get me to sit with her at the side. I didn't, and still don't, mind talking about overtly and explicitly sexual things. But then summer came along (more so a heat wave at the end of May) and I'd started wearing shorts, which showed off my hairy legs, to which she admitted to having masturbated to the thought of me.\n\nI reacted probably the worst way possible by responding with a \"You do?\". See, that was wear she started to try and actually get me to find her attractive. Though she never tried to manipulate me using cutting or suicide as a reason to get with her, she did try to use sex as an incentive for that. She started to do more suggestive things during the classes, starting by sitting on my lap and attempting to press herself against my... well, you know where this is going. See, most of the people in this class thought we were a couple after she started doing things like this. At this point it was just a rumor. She didn't actually think we were a couple.\n\nAfter a while, stripperbeard actually ended up getting that idea into her head, thinking that our love for each other was unspoken and started referring to me as her boyfriend. See, a mutual friend (not Cyn) told me about this and she kind of understood that stripperbeard was going of the deep end after I told her that we weren't dating. It was during this class that stripperbeard got her namesake. So, she full heartedly wanted to become a stripper, a high class one. During that class she pulled me into a corner of the library that we'd have class in to show me videos of her doing so. She was, in her eyes, my girlfriend and she wanted to show me a part of her. And this is where I tried to leave the friendship.\n\nIt only took her a day to get more aggressive about it. See, I've never been good with confrontation, and she kept on pushing. It got to the point where I just had to ignore her when she'd make advances and treat her like a friend. I didn't know what she would do if I got mad. At one point she actually attempted to push me into the women's bathroom to \"please her\" after pulling a dildo out of her bag, this particular instance ended with class bells ringing and my needing to go to class, which is the most literal interpretation of being saved by the bell that I've ever experienced. The final instance of her trying to push me into a sexual experience is when another one of my friend group (I'll call her artsy, because she did commission art) actually yelled at her and got the attention of a teacher who promptly took Stripperbeard to the principle. Stripperbeard got expelled after I was questioned about my experiences with her.\n\nOverall, I've gotten over my experiences with her and lack any real trauma from the experience. I was only like 16 and didn't fully understand what was going on due to my disability. But it always gives me the chills thinking back to it with my more developed mind.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Nicegirlstories","subreddit_id":"t5_ua9qe","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Nicegirlstories","subreddit_subscribers":1100,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"A story I shared on Discord a while back","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Nicegirlstories\/comments\/alx72h\/a_story_i_shared_on_discord_a_while_back\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}

She was very disrespectful to my parents and family, but they still dated. We haven\u2019t talked for 2.5 years since recently and she has changed a lot and was put on medication for her mental health issues that caused a lot of the disrespect. I am 17 and I haven\u2019t talked to her much since I was like 13 or 14. We had dinner tonight and she said I didn\u2019t talk much, and it was unusual cause it was opposite from how I used to be. I was kind of taken aback because no one has ever asked that. I\u2019m pretty sure I have undiagnosed depression and anxiety, and have suffered from ED, and it just made me feel good that someone actually noticed this type of thing. I don\u2019t know, it might be weird, but I\u2019m really glad she\u2019s back in my life, and I think we are going to get along even better now that I\u2019m older. It just feels good to have someone who shows genuine concern and cares for once.

A little BG, they aren't huge by any means, I'm a 36D. They don't give me horrible backaches or anything medical that would justify getting them reduced for that reason. The main reason is that I just literally don't like them. Its incredibly hard to find clothes that fit my frame. I'm a small with an XL chest. I've been that way since after my first child was born 7 years ago. They grew and just never went away. I'm 38 weeks pregnant now with my second and they've only gotten bigger. I'm so afraid that they are going to stay this size now, which is probably a DD by now. I've opted for sports bras so I haven't been sized.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I talk to other females about this, they literally tell me how lucky I am and I'm crazy for paying for someone to take away something that people pay to have. I explain that I just mean down to a B cup, not like total removal of my breasts, but they still think its humorous that I would even entertain a thought like that. I have yet to meet a female that sees it my way. Even the ones that have larger breasts. I guess its kind of like the I have curly hair but want straight hair and you have straight hair but want curly hair. It just makes me feel like so much less of a woman because I don't want big breasts, which I have nothing against people that have or want them, I just don't. I feel that if it was the other way around and I was talking about getting implants everyone would be supportive. Is it just the society that we live in now? The ideal female body is a thicker bottom, small waist, and a larger chest? I sure don't want to pay $5,000 to regret it but I feel I would be much more comfortable with myself if I had a smaller chest. My fianc\u00e9 on the other hand says that he will support me either way but when it was first brought up I seen the confusion and disappointment in his eyes. Ultimately I'm going to do what makes me happy but it would be nice to get some support.\n\n\nEdit: An important fact I feel like I left out, I\u2019ve been looking into this since before I got pregnant with my second but I also plan on waiting another year to try &amp; see if they reduce in size after my pregnancy &amp; I\u2019m also not planning on breastfeeding. Nothing against it, I just had a hard time my first go around &amp; I\u2019m just not willing to go through it again. Just making sure no one think it\u2019s something I\u2019m rushing into or haven\u2019t thought hard about. Any elective surgery should be researched and carefully considered. Not rushed.
