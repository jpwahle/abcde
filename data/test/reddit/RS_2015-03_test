I was normal at birth, but my feet just kept getting bigger. I was size 10 by the time I was like 5 years old. I was size 13 by age 8. So you can tell that my feet just did nothing but pretty much grow and grow. And yes, doctors do predict that I'll most likely have a growth spurt soon. \n[Do you have any ligiment or muscle problems? If not, are you expected to have them when you are older?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp0nt0k?context=5)|Yes. My feet are expected to keep getting bigger until I'm at least in my early 20's. So that obviously means they're gonna become more of a hassle to deal with as well. Doctors suggest physical therapy so I can at least get some muscle on my legs. My feet are already really heavy. \n[1\\) I can imagine it's a pain to find shoes that fit, but what about socks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp0lt65?context=5)|1) Socks are also a pain. I only have 3 pairs right now.\n[2\\) Other than having built-in swimming flippers, what do you think is the biggest up-side of having your giant feet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp0lt65?context=5)|2) I don't wanna sound like such a downer, but there aren't that many advantages to having such big feet. I guess aside from swimming, I suppose it's interesting that they can become a major topic in a conversation or on a forum (like this). \n[How hard is it to find shoes your size?...  Do they even make shoes that size?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cozyq7x?context=5)|They do make shoes my size but they need to be custom ordered. We find my shoes online and they can get pretty expensive. The biggest size I ever found in a store was a size 16. \n[I know a dude who has size ~18 feet, he's been custom ordering shoes all his life. It sounds like a massive PIA.  He is also 6'9' 350 lbs, so you have that going for you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp009ba?context=5)|I also remember coming across a guy with size 18 feet lol But he was 6'10 (maybe it was the same one and he grew an inch). And yeah, it IS a huge pain to find shoes. And I'm not so sure I'll reach 6'9 like him. My height is growing pretty normally. My feet are just really huge.\n[Shit, I wear size 13 and I have a fairly hard time finding shoes. Most stores have the popular or good looking shoes up to about size 11, then I'm usually stuck with the weird looking ones. I can only imagine what u must go through.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp07hmc?context=5)|Yeah. We can't even find my size in stores. The biggest size we can find in an actual store is size 16. So we have to custom order my shoes online. And I have very limited options... and most of them are white (which just makes the shoes appear bigger). \n[Can you kick harder? Does it give you any advantage in sports?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp07mqc?context=5)|I suppose I probably could kick harder. And no, sports are pretty much out for me unless it's swimming. I can't do a lot of running with these feet. \n[Was there ever an age where your feet didn't pose any issues in walking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp092n3?context=5)|When I was younger, even with a size 13 at age 8, it was a bit easier for me to walk than it is now. But my feet have always been pretty heavy and made it kinda hard to walk. \n[ hey, this is really cool of you to do this.  So, thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp09684?context=5)|Yeah. I had another post in the IAMA section too but I was banned for some reason from commenting and posting there... so now it's just sitting there with people asking questions and I can no longer answer them... apparently the proof I gave wasn't good enough for the mods. But I suppose this one is doing decently. \n[What was proof, like todays newspaper above your feet with the girl you were ransoming in the background?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp09a5u?context=5)|No. It was the same picture I have with this post. \n[You mentioned that the biggest feet in your family are a size 10, could you post a comparison picture? That would be incredible! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp2iknc?context=5)|I could ask my dad tomorrow to do a comparison picture. I have a picture of my feet making paint prints on a piece of paper and my dad's hand is being compared. Would you like to see that? \n[That would be cool!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp2sv80?context=5)|[Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/gallery/OT7pL5r)\n |Here's a pic of my foot being compared to my dad's hand. \n[Cool! Any word on if you'd get that foot-to-foot comparison? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp3evtg?context=5)|I haven't asked my dad yet (he works late). But I'll ask him when he gets home. Out of curiosity, what size shoes do you wear?\n[I just turned sixteen last week, I'm about 6'4, and I only have size 11.5 feet. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp3f31x?context=5)|Wow. Do you think you could deal with bigger feet? Like my size? \n[I wish I had size 14s or 15s, but 22 seems a bit too huge XD But I think it's super cool ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp3f4ze?context=5)|Yeah. Size 14-15 seems about the right size if you want big feet that aren't too hard to manage. So you think size 22 would be too big for you? My feet are actually supposed to grow bigger than size 30, so I have a lot of foot growth left.\n[How many pairs/what kind of shoes do you own? What kind are the most comfortable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp0ikut?context=5)|I only have one pair right now and they fit fine. But my feet are expected to have a growth spurt soon... so they won't fit much longer. \n[Exactly how long/wide are your feet?  When did you realize that they were getting larger than they should? Did they gradually but steadily get bigger or was it a sudden thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp0bo4t?context=5)|My feet are about 15-16 inches long and (I think) 6-7 inches wide. And I've had big feet my whole life. When I was 5 years old, I was already in men's sizes. I was size 13 by age 8.\n[How uncomfortable is it for you to lie in bed (under blankets\\) on your back? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp02dtf?context=5)|It can get kinda awkward. Especially when I turn over in my bed and the blanket kinda gets pulled along with my feet and then falls to the floor.\n[How do you walk? Like how do you step? Or is it the same? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp04jv5?context=5)|Walking is a bit of a task for me. I often need to manually lift my feet and move them forward as I go. \n[Ha ha ha no shit. What I meant was do you trip over your feet more? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp0d7ki?context=5)|Yes I do. Imagine trying to walk with size 22s all day and night. What size do you wear?\n[I'm 15 and 6\"4 with a EU shoesize of 49 and US 17, i (kinda\\) know how you feel. But holy fucking shit, is it taught for me to find good shoes.. But i can't imagen what it must be like for you.  And you ruined it for every large footed person! The myth is true, *wink* *wink* ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cozzp0t?context=5)|Size 17 is pretty big. But at least you also have the height. I'm 5'8 with size 22. Imagine how that must be. And yeah, finding good shoes is hard. We need to get my shoes online (custom order) and there aren't often many options. Are your feet still growing? \n[So how many Hobbits jokes do you hear in any given week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cozzaum?context=5)|Quite a few. I also constantly hear Bigfoot jokes. People also joke that I could ski with my feet or use my shoes for boats. \n[Well at least you are hard to push aside with such a firm stand on the ground! I mostly order online, from size 15 i believe you can't get them in stores. My feet are still groing, sadly.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp00187?context=5)|I've seen up to size 16 in the stores in my area. And yeah, my feet are growing still too. For your sake, I hope you don't end up a size 22. \n[I know people with normal sized feet than can water ski barefoot.  I'd imagine you'd do well with this.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp05gjk?context=5)|Haha I guess so then. \n[Does Bigfoot take plaster-of-Paris molds of your feet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cozycct?context=5)|No. But my family and friends have found it amusing to see my footprints made with paint. The paper needs to be pretty big. \n[Do you ever wish your feet were normal size?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp084am?context=5)|Yes. I often really wonder how my life would be if I had a size 9 or 10. Having really big feet can just really suck. \n[Is your foot the same length as your forearm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp0mstg?context=5)|No. I've had this question asked many times before. My arms are kinda long, but don't match with my feet at all. \n[It looks like they are different sizes and colours. Is that just the photo? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp117zy?context=5)|Yes. It's the lighting. But one foot is bigger than the other though. But the camera's angle kinda exaggerated the difference. \n[Yeah hopefully the growth stops soon.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp0mnor?context=5)|According to doctors, the growth is supposed to keep going until my early to mid 20's (I know, hard to believe). So I'm not sure it'll stop anytime soon. But you're right, it is what it is. I just have really big feet.\n[Yes I'm sure but it is what it is. Just have some goals for yourself and work to accomplish them. That will allow you to focus on something else besides your feet and people's reactions to them. Don't let people tear you down over something you can't control. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp0mnor?context=5)|It's not very easy to drive my focus away from my feet (especially since they play a pretty big part in my life). But I try my best all the time. But I still know people will always stare and make comments, so I make the best of it as well. I try to balance everything together. \n[Well if you can stand it, some day you can make some money off it. Guinness world records , tv shows, YouTube, Instagram.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp188ys?context=5)|We'll just have to wait and see how big my feet get. And if it comes to breaking a record, I guess I'll have that going for me. Something good could come out of this.\n[Let me know if ya need a manager. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2xgshq/im_a_14_year_old_male_and_my_feet_are_size_2223_us/cp188ys?context=5)|Just curious.

I have lots and lots of friends/acquaintances outside of school, however they are basically all male people...\n\n**(-)** I discovered at very young age I had the gift to read and analyze people very very well and having the power to influence a person with ease, to tell each individual exactly the right thing to make him laugh, cry, etc according to their personality.\nBut the downside is it doesn't work with females! It's not that I lack confidence (or maybe it is?), I love talking to random people (if they are male or age 30+) and make successful conversations but somehow when I encouter a conversation with a girl with same age as me, I suddenly don't know what to say. I mean it's not a problem when girl is being very talkative and all I have to do is make some witty answer or comment but sadly very few girls are like this in my country and I just can't spawn ANY initiative subject/sentence from myself in conversations with girls. It's like my mind goes blank. **(-)**\n\nSince I'm not good with telling stories, but stating points, I point out few facts about myself that maybe help analyzing me better:\n\n- I was in religious middle school, where boys and girls were kept in separate classes. (I'm atheist)\n- School psychology test showed me that I am more extrovert than introvert and a massive control freak.\n- I sometimes question my mental stability\n- I love being dominant in conversations (if I could with girls, I would with them too :( )\n- Grew up in bad neighbourhood where violence was common\n- I have made out with girls twice, but that was only because they were attracted to me and were initiative. (also alcohol)\n- Not bad looking guy (not also a superstar looking)\n- Worked one summer being a salesman and broke all the employee records in the company (WHYY CANT I USE MY POTENTIAL WITH GIRLS? D:)\n\n\nNow inb4 the \"start talking with lots of different girls, it'll get better\" comments, I'm gonna say it out that people here in eastern europe are very closed and it's hard to start conversations with anybody.\n\nReason I posted here, is because it feels really bad when I always have to avoid talking personally with girls and maybe you guys/gals can give me something.\n \n \n \n \n**TL;DR**\nRead the **(-)** paragraph","retrieved_on":1440880063,"ups":10}

I figured it was time to update! (Side note: I'm 23 with no children)\n\n**Things are going great!** \n\n**Periods:**\nI've only had 2 periods. The first was 1 month after insertion and the other was 3 months later (4 months post-insertion). In both situations I had been experiencing sore nipples for a few days before my period started. As annoying as that is, I'm glad I at least get some kind of heads up that it's coming! My period is very light now. During my last period I decided to use 1 light tampon a day and 1 at night because I didn't want to wear panty-liners. (edit: As /u/minouu pointed out, tampons should be changed every 6-8 hours for health and safety reasons, even with light perods. So don't wear them for 12 hours at a time like I did!) After a few days I just decided to stop even wearing a tampon, and I didn't notice any spotting in my underwear. And that was that! \n\n**Acne**: My acne has completely cleared up! I had pretty bad acne for my first 3-4 months on my Mirena but my skin is great now. :)\n\n**Libido**: Still going strong!\n\n**Mood:** Still normal!\n\n**Strings:** Still right where they always are! (edit: I have actually only ever been able to feel ONE string, not both. Nothing has changed!)\n\n**Conclusion**: All my side effects have cleared up and I am so glad that I switched from the pill to Mirena.\n\nMy original post (the 14 week update) goes into a lot of detail about insertion, my first period after insertion, any side effects I was having, comfort during sex, etc. Here is the link again if you're curious: [link!](http://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/2ow53u/my_experience_with_mirena_so_far_14_weeks_in/)\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions.","media":null,"name":"t3_2xihb3","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"id":"2xihb3","num_comments":8,"author_flair_css_class":"","saved":false,"over_18":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"ritz_bitz","stickied":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/2xihb3/my_experience_with_mirena_so_far_6_months_in/","secure_media":null,"created":1425169458,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2snsq","edited":1425313616,"score":1,"quarantine":false}

VIII: King of the Slaves] (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2xfptk/rise_of_nations_pride_pt_viii_king_of_the_slaves/), [Vol. I end] (http://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2xn3u7/rise_of_nations_pride_pt_x_gate_to_the_west_end/)\n\n*It* descended from the clouds, as God had appeared to Abraham itself. Yet despite its claim, this was no god. It's feathered face featured cruel, lizard like eyes, and it's pointed beak revealed 2 rows of tiny sharp teeth. But that was not the most frightful thing about the creature. It was what it said in it's malicious, booming voice.\n\n\"Helmans! Kneel before your God Gilgamesh! By divine right I am your Emperor for I am your life! Should you refuse your rightful place as my slaves and worshippers, I shall just as easily become *death*.\" \n\nThe great bird-creature in the sky suddenly changed, but the voice remained.\n\n\"This shall become of your civilization if you refuse!\" It echoed loudly, as the image turned to a large city, razed to the ground. It's people hewn upon the blood stained ground, and great monuments broken. People all around Alders were either gasping in disbelief or staring in awe. Children cried holding their mothers, and all Alders could do was stare. He had tried to convince himself for the past week that this was just another adventure the Marine corps was known for having, but this was something else entirely. \n\n\"All who stand in the path of the God-King Gilgamesh shall be crushed and maimed! You savages have one day to surrender, and you shall signal this by burning the tallest structure in your city. Do this and you shall live as my slaves.\" with that the bird-creature's face that was in the sky vanished.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"Well don't just stand their you lazy fucks! Get to the Hagia Sophia now!\" Shouted sergeant Grady. Several yes sirs were given and Alder's platoon started running. As they made a turn on one of the main avenues, chaos was rampant. Soldiers dashing to and fro, people screaming and running around. Pure utter chaos. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"Push through the crowd! Form two lines and push! We've got to get to protect the Blue Mosque, and Hagia Sophia in case some asshole decides to burn it down! You two! Step aside and form a corridor so you can get these people past us!\" \n\nAlders and Chambers went in to the middle of the line and formed a gap in the line so the crowd of rampant citizens could tunnel through. Like a drain for water, the people in the street soon cleared up and the platoon began to jog at a brisk pace.\n\n\"Where'd you learn to do that sergeant? I've never practiced a drill like that.\" mentioned Chambers.\n\n\"I was a Pinkerton back in '57.\" replied Grady hastily.\n\n\"Alrighty then. Alders, Chambers! You two go tell Lieutenant whats-his-face from the wagon ride to gather his men at the Hagia Sophia. The rest of you! We're going to the Blue Mosque!\"\n\nGrady and the other 22 men ran off into the other direction, leaving Alders and Chambers in an eerily empty street. \n\n\"Jesus Christ. This has got to be the shittiest situation I've been in, and I saw the Battle of Gettysburg!\"\n\n\"Yeah well at least we're not gonna be eaten by cannibals in the Pacific.\"\n\n\"Yeah maybe not by cannibals, just giant fucken birds and ants.\" replied Chambers doubtfully. The two made their way down several side streets in the Istanbul slums.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"Alders are you seeing this?\" \n\nAs the two men walked through a small, empty street they saw people boarding their houses in and looking at them through the cracks in between. Those without homes begged the two soldiers for food.\n\n\"Yeah.\" Alders said meekly.\n\n\"Hold up a second.\" Alders said in a stronger voice this time.\n\n\"Bize fahi\u015fe lanet yemek ver!\" \n\n\"L\u00fctfen durun!\"\n\n\"What the hell is that?\" The two men raised their weapons tensely, and strode forth even more cautiously then before. As they came upon an alley the voices grew louder.\n\n\"Ver yoksa ben senin kollar\u0131n\u0131 kesmek olacak!\"\n\nAs Alders and Chambers turned, they saw a gang of rough looking men with daggers holding what looked like a teenage girl against her will and several baskets of vegetables.\n\n\"Hey!\" shouted Alders.\n\n\"Let go of the girl! Now!\" \n\n\"Bu nedir?\" said a large man stepping out of the shadows.\n\n\"Ne istiyorsun!?\" He shouted at the two marines.\n\n\"Sorry, we don't understand muslim.\" Chambers said ignorantly.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe man sneered. Then he began to speak English.\n\n\"American scum. Who are you that interfere with our business!?\" he spat out. He began to walk briskly toward Chambers.\n\nChambers began to point to himself in a sarcastic manner.\n\n\"Me? You've never heard of me? What's wrong with you man! I'm the famous, the one and only.\" He paused for just a second as he raised his [Winchester rifle] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_rifle) up to the Turk's face.\n\n\"I, good sir, am Mr. get the fuck outta my face.\" The Turk immediately backed away from the large rifle\n\n\"Now what you very nice men are going to do, is leave all the food here, and leave this nice young lady alone.\"\n\nMost of the men had already ran off once they saw the 2 Americans and their guns, but three stubborn ones had stayed. Now at the threat of being shot at they too ran out of the alley.\n\n\"And that's how you deal with punks Alders.\"\n\n\"Gee, I never woulda guessed.\"\n\n\"Of course you wouldn't have.\"\n\n\"We don't have time to help this lady though, we gotta go now Chambers.\"\n\n\"Yeah...just a shame.\" They turned their backs to the now sobbing girl, who would probably just be attacked again later. \n\nAs the two men walked out of the slums neither could stop thinking about the current state of affairs. People killing each other while an army of bird-ant-monsters gathered on Europe's door step was not the greatest combination of events. The only good thing was the ridiculously large 500,000 strong army gathered at Istanbul. As the two americans arrived at the entrance of the Hagia Sophia, they were greeted by the jovial Mehmet the Turk.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"Ah! My American friends! How are you on this fine day!\" Mehmet said pointing at the dark grey clouds gathering in the sky.\n\n\"Oh we were doing just fine, until Chambers here decided it would be a good idea to stick a gun in another guys face.\"\n\n\"Hey! He came onto me first! Besides they were about to kill some young girl and he had a big ass sword in his hand.\"\n\nMehmet laughed at the comment.\n\n\"Yes the slums of Istanbul has many undesirable thugs. You are lucky to have made it out alive in fact. But enough of that. What brings you here?\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"Well a few things actually. Mostly what the giant bird face that was in the sky said. Sergeant Grady told us to tell Lieutenant Serim to garrison the Hagia Sophia in case some one decided to burn it, but it seems you've got us beat.\"\n\n\"Indeed. As soon as that bird mentioned it the Lieutenant sent us and plenty of water in case of what you described.\" Mehmet said motioning to the 50 some Jannissaries and 100 regular troops.\n\n\"Well. Now that it seems we've been sent here for nothing...what's new?\" said Alders.\n\nMehmets face became grim. \n\n\"As you two already know. The situation is dire. But much worse than you think. This morning I was on my guard shift for General Osman. It appears that not only is a massive army coming from across the Bosphorus, it appears that we've been flanked by two massive armies that have turned southwards and are converging on Istanbul by land. Even if are destined to be defeated, it seems we will not be able to escape. Sultan Abdulaziz has declared that we shall not surrender, and that we shall fight these creatures to the last man, woman and child.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlders jaw dropped in shock. He knew that fighting against a foe this strong gave him a very good chance of dying. But he had always felt sure in the strength of the US military. That is what the posters said didn't they? \"Enlist in the unstoppable armies of freedom today!\" was the phrase Alders recalled. Alders was willing to take a high risk of death, but to be guaranteed it was something very different. Memories of the dirty tenement in New York flashed through his mind. \"You look just like your great grandfather\" he remembered his young mother saying to him. He remembered his great grandfather as well. A tall black haired dutchman with bright green eyes. Out of 7 children, he was the only one to inherit that look. He had always enjoyed his stories about the Revolutionary War, and how he had served under Washington at the crossing of the Delaware, and suffered at Valley Forge. He had remembered him at times staring into nothingness, repeating the same four words \"And the world burned.\" It sent shivers through Thomas Alders spine. Yet it was all he could think of now.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"Well how much longer before those feathered fucks arive?\" inquired Chambers.\n\n\"They arrive...within the night.\" Mehmet said sadly.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n*BOOM* The crack of thunder and lightning illuminated the stretch of land just 2 miles across the Bosphorus strait. There Alders could see from the Gate of St. Aemilianus the vast horde the creatures had brough forth. An estimated 800,000 we were told. \n\n*BOOM* Different this time, not thunder for it was much louder than that. Cannon fire from an ironclad warship's 110lb [Armstrong gun] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBL_7_inch_Armstrong_gun#Use_in_action). \n\n\"See those ripples in the waves Alders?\" whispered Grady to Alders.\n\n\"Yes sir.\" \n\n\"Those are landing craft. Those creatures think they're so strong they're just ignoring our ships. Arrogant bastards.\"\n\nAlders looked next to him. A young boy he looked barely 16 but was big for his age, was shaking at the knees.\n\n\"Take it easy kid. What's your name?\" Alders tapped him lightly.\n\n\"S-Sir?\" he replied.\n\n\"I'm not a sir kid, just a corporal. How old are you?\" \n\n\"14 si-. Corporal. I'm 14.\"\n\n\"Wow! You're big for your age. No wonder you got past the recruiting office.\"\n\n\"Thank you corporal.\" he responded.\n\n\"Don't be afraid. Those monsters across the water are just as killable as us. They bleed just as we bleed. Now quit shaking. If you can't fight your dead. If you do fight then their is only a really high chance that your dead.\" Alders joked morbidly.\n\n\"Which one would you rather take?\"\n\n\"I'd take only a high chance corporal.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGrady cleared his throat and began\n\n\"Alright boys listen up. Those bastards are gonna land soon. Real soon, I say about two minutes. I'm gonna start a countdown at 10, at which point you're all gonna get ready understand? At 5 you're gonna present arms and at 0 you're gonna give those bastards hell! You got me?!\"\n\n\"Yes sir!\" The 100 men in the trench shouted in unison.\n\n\"Here comes the day of reckoning.\" Chambers said lowly.\n\n\"10!\"\n\nThe ships came closer.\n\n\"9!\"\n\nFlying machines zoomed past overhead.\n\n\"8!\"\n\nThe ironclads in the strait kept on firing.\n\n\"7!\"\n\nIt had begun to rain.\n\n\"6!\" \n\nThe soldiers tensed up and the ships came even closer to the harbour.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"5! PRESENT ARMS!\"\n\nIn fluid motion, the 100 US marines raised their rifles.\n\n\"4!\"\n\n\"By the way kid. I'm Corporal Alders. What's your name?\"\n\n\"3!\"\n\n\"Th-Theodore. Theodore Roosevelt.\"\n\n\"2! MAKE READY!\"\n\n\"Fuck.\" Chambers said.\n\n\"1!!

They were accepting of me to a degree. As soon as I brought up starting HRT, my dad got a bit difficult. He brought up my neighbor/uncle who apparently also had gender dysphoria. My dad literally said, \"He's been living like that all his life and hasn't done anything about it. Why can't you?\" I had to tell him repeatedly that that wasn't what I wanted and how I felt inside. A bunch of questions and responses later, he tells me that he's going to schedule and appointment for me and my pediatrician on Friday. \n\nFast forward to Friday. My dad is driving me home from school and before I get out of the car, I ask my dad about the doctor's appointment and all of that. He told me that the insurance we have didn't cover what I wanted and that we wouldn't be able to afford it. I went into hysterics. I have this thought that he probably didn't even ask or didn't ask for the right thing.

(I'm 26 weeks, there are still 3 months to go!) She said they don't want to \"miss it.\"\n\nWhen my husband told me this, I said, \"Miss what? Sitting in the waiting room for 17 hours?\" He mentioned they might want to \"pop in and say hi,\" and I told him that the only person other than doctors/nurses allowed in the room is him. That's it, for all of labor. Even if things are going well and I'm bored off my ass, I want zero visitors. Same goes for the first hour or so after the baby is born.\n\nBIL and his wife just had a baby last fall, and she had both moms in during her labor to visit and commiserate. I'm just not that type of person. I want my privacy, and my chance to share this experience with my husband and ONLY my husband. I don't even want my own mother in there. I also don't want my divorced parents being forced to spend 17 hours (or however long my labor is) sitting in the hospital having to deal with each other, when both of them have jobs to go to. I know that my mom would probably get fired if she missed work for 2 days because she sat through her daughter's labor in the hospital (her boss/job is really shitty like that). So his parents are going to be there for the whole thing, and mine won't (or will, but will hate each other even more afterwards).\n\nAlso, if his parents are sitting around in the hospital the entire time, they're going to be itching for news, and instead of calling them he'll have to go talk to them. Which means he's out there with them, and not in the room with his laboring wife. If I feel preggo rage about that now, that's not going to fly when I'm raging through labor.\n\nI feel like this isn't fair. I don't want his parents sitting out in the waiting room making my own parents feel obligated to be there or shitty for not being there. I don't want them stealing my husband's time away from me, and I definitely don't want them sneaking past nurses (whom I will happily recruit to enforce my no visitor policy) to \"pop in and say hi.\" WTF.\n\nI know I still have an entire trimester to figure this out, but I'm pissed. What do I do/say to my MIL to make her understand my wishes? Do I have the right to request that they don't even come to the hospital? Am I being a ruthless bitch about it all? I only get to give birth to my son once, and I don't want to look back on it and regret not standing my ground.\n\nBonus background info: MIL was a post-partum nurse for 30+ years, and worked at the hospital I'll be giving birth at. It's the best facility in town, but I feel like she thinks I chose it because it was her recommendation. She still knows some of the staff there (but not much, because she's been retired for a while). Same with the OB clinic I've been going to, and the pediatrics office we've chosen to go with. (Her recommendations were sound, but they could have come from anyone and I still would have checked them out.) She has overstepped her bounds multiple times when it comes to my OB clinic, once even calling her friend there to ask for advice about a medical issue I was having, then calling me with the recommendation. I have been having serious personal boundary issues with MIL this entire pregnancy, and this latest thing is really close to being the last straw."}

I will turn 18 in April. This predicament that I am in, is dealing with my mother, and moving out.\n\n\nMy mom had me young. She was 16, turned 17 a month later. She never really \"grew up\". She would drop me off at my grandparents for days, sometimes weeks, in her 20s to go party and get drunk/high. She's also left me with \"friends\" of hers to do the same, people I'd never met before. She's been addicted to several drugs. Between the ages of 3-4, I was put into the foster care system because she was found smoking meth around me. Spent my 4th birthday in a stranger's home; I don't even remember my mom coming to visit me that day. When I was 8, she lost custody of me again because she fell asleep at the wheel of her car while I was in it, by taking too many xanax's. She spent about a month in jail that time, and because no other family was in the county we lived in, I went into the system for a second time. Now, my mom goes to a methadone clinic, so at least she is trying to clean up her act and get sober, or at least not be so out there on so many drugs. She won custody back both times. \n\nI don't know who my father is. There is no name on my birth certificate. My mom swears up and down she doesn't know/remember who he is, that I'm just a product of a one night stand (sometimes, she'll say she was raped and I am a product of rape, not sure which story to believe). \n\nEver since I hit puberty, my mom has gotten abusive. Not physical, but emotional and verbal. She has told me on more than one occasion how she \"should have aborted me like my dad wanted her to\" and that I'll \"never amount to anything and end up like her\". She has torn me down so many times, I have been suicidal in the past. When I tried to talk to her about these things I were feeling, she told me to suck it up, life isn't fair, and all of that stuff. When I was in a really bad place, I begged for her to get me some help, let me see a therapist or something, she just laughed in my face and called my bluff. That led to a suicide attempt when I was 15, but she still swears I was doing it for attention. \n\nI know, deep down, the smart decision is to just wait it out another two months until I graduate in June, but as my birthday nears, she's getting worse. The other day, I was sick in bed (had a fever of 101 and a sore throat) and once she found out I slept in past 8 am, she began to call me a \"lazy bitch\" and how it's a wonder I haven't failed any of my classes (only missed six days this entire school year due to sickness). She gets so angry at the drop of a hat. I could ask her what's for dinner and then she explodes on me, calling me an ungrateful bitch and how she shouldn't have to do anything. \n\nI don't know if I can handle another two months of her yelling at me, calling me names and making me feel so worthless. My grandparents refuse to step in and help - I can't tell you the amount of times I've called them, asking them to come pick me up so I could get away from her when she's high, or going on one of her rants. But I do have an uncle who's willing to take me in once April gets here, he knows the situation and knows how bad my mom can be/is. He's about 400 miles away from where we live now, and can arrange transportation for me (it'll be a greyhound bus, but it's better than hitchhiking).\n\nI know that if I do take my uncle up on this chance and move in with him, my mom will be incredibly pissed and upset and might even try to keep me from going anywhere, (I'm  5'0\", 90lbs soaking wet. My mom has a good 100lbs on me and has actually held me down/pushed me against a wall while yelling at me before)\n\n She's my mom, and I love her, and without her I wouldn't be here, but I don't think I could handle another two months of her abuse. I have a little over $600 put back and I'm hoping I can save up even more money. \n\nI think deep down, my mom does actually care about me/loves me, but she doesn't know how to do it in a healthy way. I am so scared of ending up like her when I have kids (if I have any). \n\n\nI'm not sure which option to choose. I want to get away from her as soon as possible, but I have no idea how to break it to her without her getting worse/angrier. Feels like I'm trapped,  and I don't know how to get out. I know my uncle will support me in finishing high school or getting my GED once/if I move in with him, and helping me get a job, and my license (she's never allowed me to get them) and everything else, but I fear her backlash. \n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Turning 18 in April. Mother's verbal/emotional abuse is escalating. Want to move in with my uncle, but not sure how to do it without mother getting even more angrier.

So I am 19 weeks now and my baby has been kicking pretty steady now, even to where my husband can catch a kick now and then. Yesterday I was sitting back on the couch, playing around on my laptop when I started feeling a weird... pressure in my abdomen, I guess? I really didn't know how to describe the feeling, it lasted a while before I realized that my baby was pressed against the front of my belly, and I could feel exactly where they were with my hand. (This was both super freaky and really cool at the same time) Anyway, it went from them pressing into the front, to shifting around and right before I went to bed they like... dropped to be low and towards the back. Of course they did this right as I went to pee so that became weird. Then it kinda hurt to walk, like they were blocking a muscle or something to my thigh on my right leg and getting into bed hurt because of where they were laying. Once I laid down they settled into a better position and I went to sleep. Today I managed to get half through the day, walked around a little expo center for 2 hours, then on the way home they started shifting around and giving me pressure but at times it also kinda hurt. (like a dull ache, sometimes with a slight twinge like they kicked me in the spot they were already squishing) Then they would shift after a couple of minutes and it would stop hurting, and they would move to a different spot and make that feel uncomfortable and the dull ache would come back. They only really bothered me if they were low or towards the back, it was just slight pressure if they were in the front towards the belly button. They kept shifting around making different spots hurt for an hour or so then I guess they went to sleep or something and I stopped getting any pressure or pain. I have been getting less \u201ckicks\u201d now and more of these pressure pains/movement. Has anyone else had anything like this? My husband was getting worried because of the pain involved, but I spoke to a medical friend who has had two kids herself who said her son in her 2nd pregnancy was kind of like that, constantly moving and being in uncomfortable positions, when her daughter in her first preg had been very quiet and she barely knew she was there. So she said I should mention it to my gyn when I'm there on Tues for an appointment, but I don\u2019t think it sounds like anything to worry about because of the pain not being in just one spot and because I could feel them actually moving around, but I thought I would see if this was a common thing around here. \n\nTLDR: 19weeks past two days less kicking (still happens though) and more moving now with random spots of pressure that change multiple times an hour when it happens for about hr or so. Pressure dull aches/hurts sometimes but just general uncomfortable feeling sometimes in lower abdomen area too. Right now as I finish typing this bunch of little kicks.\n","media":null,"link_flair_text":"Help?","permalink":"/r/BabyBumps/comments/2xitgk/weird_dullaching_moving_pressure_at_19_weeks/","is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"Akiro_Lyall","name":"t3_2xitgk","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":"hme","archived":true,"id":"2xitgk","author_flair_css_class":"BOY","num_comments":3,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"score":6,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s7cl","created":1425176534,"from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/2xitgk/weird_dullaching_moving_pressure_at_19_weeks/","secure_media":null}

{"media":null,"selftext":"Hey there,\nmy story might not be that intresting, but I have nobody to talk to, and I kinda feel the need to share it now..\n\n\nSo I'm 21 years old, used to be a normal guy from good family, always had good grades, never caused some serious problems and all that. However, I've never put much effort into studying, I was just basing on what I learnt on lessons, sometimes cheating.\n\nThis changed 2 years ago, after I graduated high school- my exams went well, I got into university I /wanted/- I never really knew what I want to do in life so I chose something random- economics. Starting there was also moving out from home- and that's where my problems started I think.. I got a lot of more freedom, I pretty much started spending all days and nights playing games and about 4 months later I got kicked out of uni. I didn't tell anybody, in fact my family still doesn't know about it. I tried to commit suicide 2 times back then I think, but something stopped me.. Then few months later my friends found out that I got kicked out. They conviced me that is not a big deal and that I can start over.. so I did.. But, it happend again. I started over, the same major and got kicked again pretty much due to the same reason.\n\nTo sum it up: I'm 2 times now univeristy drop out, my family and most of the people around me are sure that I'm on second year. I've been taking money from my parents for /studying/ for year and an half now. I can't really tell them about it because I know they would never accept it.. I know it sounds stupid but that's the truth, I would get kicked out of the house and I have nowhere to go.. \n\nI just don't want to be on this world anymore, I'm huge loser, I've lost all of my friends because I've been spending so much time on playing games. I dissapointed my family, and I don't have balls to tell them the truth so I've been lying for so long to everybody, but the lies are cumulative and it will soon all be out. \n\nI have nobody to talk to in real life so I decided to post it here.. I don't even know if it's right section, but yeah.. I'm going to try to end this sh*t life once again. Sorry if it's chaotic, hope somebody will talk to me here. Thank you for reading.

I am astounded at some of these stories. I didn't think anyone else would ever understand what I have gone through. Wow.\n\nI've always had mental and emotional issues stemming from my childhood. In the last two years things have spiraled out of control and I don't know what to do. \n\nTwo years ago my grandmother died. She was in hospice care and we all knew it was coming. A few days before she passed, my dad had her removed from her home and placed in the care of a distant family member (basically a stranger). He wouldn't allow his dad, only sibling, or myself and my siblings to see her in the two days before she died. He gave us permission to come see her the morning she died. However, we did not know she had died. We were all under the impression we were going to have a family lunch with her, knowing it may be her last. My sister and grandfather arrived first, together. Grandmother had been cleaned up, her oxygen placed on her &amp; turned on, and she was propped up in the bed making it look like she was sleeping. He let my sister and grandpa go into her room thinking she was alive. He never told them she was dead. My sister began speaking to her and they thought at first she was sleeping. After a few minutes, they realized she was dead and my sister began screaming. I was on my way there and by the time I got there and realized what happened I was in shock. My sister's husband was furious. The next few days were a blur. Eventually my sister confronted him and he denied ever knowing she was dead. Her husband, a nurse, called bullshit and said he could tell the scene was staged and it was done deliberately. I'm confident this was the reason my grandfather's health began failing immediately.\n\nA while after the funeral, he kicked my ailing grandfather out of his own home. He is the legal owner of the house. It's a long story. His behavior has gotten steadily worse since my grandmother died and with my grandfather's subsequent health issues. He somehow blamed my grandfather for her death. He refused to talk to him for months. Now he is doing everything in his power to get back involved in grandpa's life, mainly trying to gain access to land deeds, bank info, his will, and the trusts he has set up in our names. \n\nDuring grandmother's funeral and after, he played the victim. He was distraught in public. It's so much more detailed than what I can get into here but the same thing that happened before is happening again. I can't go through this again.\n\nA few weeks ago, I ventured home to help take care of my grandfather while he was in the hospital because he was afraid to be alone. My sister and I drove over 100 miles each to take turns sitting with him for a few days. My parents live in the same town. During those few days, I was staying at my parents' house. My dad never spoke to me, except to try to tell me how horribly he had been treated by his sister. She has been caring for him since my grandmother's death (because he was kicked out of his own home) with no help from my dad. I tried to explain to him that he was wrong and he blew up at me. I recently quit my job to go back to school full time, something I've wanted to do for a decade. I'm 34 and still unsure of what exactly I want to do but I was miserable in my profession. He made fun of me for going back to school and called me a 40 year old loser that couldn't take care of herself and would always be alone and never amount to anything. I said nothing, went upstairs to sleep, and prepared to leave the next morning. I cried all night. I've always hated myself, because of him. I'm single, my brother and sister are both happily married, great jobs, wonderful lives(minus their massive anxiety issues because of our parents), and I will never have that. I was born before my sister's first birthday and they never wanted me. I was told this on multiple occasions. My life has always been chaos, but I refuse to settle. I don't want that anymore but I feel it's too late for me. I'm ready to give up. The morning I got up to leave, I was still crying. My mom heard me, asked me what was wrong and when I told her she exploded and threw a bag of dog treats at me. I told her I couldn't take it anymore and she said oh it's our fault right; you're going to blame us for everything that's ever happened in your life and all of your mistakes. I just walked out and left. \n\nSince that day, I don't know what's happened to me but I'm suicidally depressed. I want to give up. I know better than this though but I can barely get out of bed most days. I can't believe their actions are still affecting me this way. I was always an outcast. In fact, I was relentlessly bullied, especially by a girl who's dad had been screwed over by mine, something I was never aware of until years later. I'm too old for this. Too old to be single, starting over, in college with a bunch of 20 year olds. I moved to a place where I know no one and haven't made any friends in 2 years. I moved here for school and my career initially and worked 80 hour weeks the first year I was here and ended up getting completely screwed there as well. I had a contract with my boss and he refused to honor it after someone else in the company complained to him that I was being sexually harassed (and even molested) by a co-worker. I eventually got fired over this and had to sue him. I've been dealing with that headache as well over the last year. That's yet another long story.\n\nI'm at my wit's end here. I don't know what to do. This isn't normal, right? I always end up making the wrong decision. Everything I do is a mistake. I know it's because I was neglected growing up and never had a support system. Something's got to give. I want to give up on everything. I'm questioning my decision to go back to school. I know I stayed in a horrible, abusive work situation for so long because that's all I've ever known. All of my equipment was stolen by my boss and he refused to give it back, so even if I wanted to do what I was doing before, I can't. That was thousands of dollars, not to mention the almost $30,000 he owes me on top of that. \n\nI'm dangerously close to giving up and I apologize for putting it here but some of you have to know what I'm going through. I need to know I'm not crazy. I need to know this isn't normal. I need to know not to give up. But for what? I have nothing. I go to sleep and wake up alone every day I can't do that anymore. I'm lost. ","media":null}

A girl I had been chatting with, let's call her Jessie, wrote me back and we quickly fell into some sexy banter..  \n\nIt was getting on lunchtime, she was in a hotel room near Dupont Circle - avoiding her ex who was in her house (I'm presuming they may not have been completely broken up).  And we were both hungry.  I suggested bringing over some lunch and she quickly, eagerly, agreed..  and said she was craving some McDonalds.  And gave me her room number..\n\nNot my usual food, but whatever.  I jump on the metro, grab the food, and carry it over to the hotel.  Freezing.  Ride the elevator up, making small-talk with a hotel employee who thought I was a guest, and then I was there.  Her room service tray from breakfast in the hallway..  I knocked.  Long pause.  Then the door opens..\n\nShe's in some incredibly pink fuzzy pajamas.  A long t-shirt.  No bra.  Blonde curly hair.  Grey eyes.  Probably D-cups, nice curves on her hips, and I'm smiling.  I'm 5'10\". 170 lbs.  Short brownish blonde hair.  I bike / run and am reasonably fit..  \n\nWe sit on her bed and eat.  She has Law and Order on and we make small talk..  laughing.  Inching closer.  Fries are the last to go.. and then I clear everything off the bed and sit closer.  Rubbing her back.  \"You like me?\"  she says.  And I lean in and kiss her..  \n\nShe's a good kisser - hungry lips.  Hands sliding under her shirt.  Under mine.  I lift off her shirt and kiss down her chest.  Sucking her nipples, hearing her moan.  She pushes me back and starts tugging at my shirt.  It's quickly on the floor as she slides back into the pillows..\n\nI tug off those pink pajamas and the panties at once..  kiss up her thighs.  She apologizes for not waxing, but I love a bit of stubble and start to lick...  Slowly at first, building up a rhythm.  She's getting wetter and wetter.  I start fucking her with my tongue and she's moaning.  She hasn't been eaten like this in years, she cries.  She cums.  Hard.  Shaking.  I slide up her body.  Stand and take off my jeans quickly.  \n\nMy cock out, hard, she reaches to return the favor.  I let her lick for a minute, but want to fuck.  And she wants it too..  I grab a condom from my coat on the couch and roll it on, she spreads her legs and plays with herself on the bed as I watch.  \n\nI move between her legs, fucking slowly at first, then harder.  Grabbing her hips, her tits.  Kissing.  She's so wet.  She wants on top, and wants me to stay inside.  I thrust deep, grab her hips and roll her on top of me in one move.  She smiles and starts riding me.  Tits bouncing..  moaning.  I grab her ass, slapping it.  She moans louder.  Getting closer.  I can't take it anymore and cum, hard.  She feels it and cums too, collapsing on top of me.  \n\nI wash up, get dressed, and head back out..  smiling.

Then, I did two years in a private catholic college for accounting. It was the summer between high school and college that I started taking freelance writing gigs online. I realized I had a talent for it. I kept with school to get an education on my resume and strengthen my business and real world smarts. I then started working as a marketing copywriter, and followed my passion. I have worked at a few marketing firms and now make $52,000 a year as a writer/strategist and have held this position for a year and a half now. I did this for myself. I was motivated to succeed and I go the extra mile every day. While here, I have been privileged enough to publish two of my own books.

A little background on me; I identify as queer because I feel as if that encompasses my openness to date people outside the binary better than other identities, although I have always been more attracted to women. I have been with others people who identified as trans or gender non-conforming before my current partner. \n\nMy partner and I began dating over a year and a half ago. He then identified as female. We decided to be exclusive soon after and began sleeping together. I noticed some things during sex that I had noticed when being intimate with partners in the past who were trans. I brought it up gently and he was shocked that I even noticed. It had apparently been something he had been hiding and carrying with him for a long time. Some time passed and he decided that it was definitely time he started living and presenting as a man. I was fully supportive and had family members and close friends who were able to help him begin his transition. Things were great for a long time, he was so much happier and more confident. It was a wonderful thing to be a part of. As I mentioned before, I have been with people who identify as trans, but I had never been with someone who started hormones before. It was a little scary to think about, there are so many misconceptions about what could happen. Everyone is obviously different. When he decided he was ready for hormones, a year of living and presenting as male, I was his biggest cheerleader. Finally something that he was so looking forward to was happening! \n\nFinally, the point, hormones have pretty much changed everything. Which is okay, there are pros and cons. It is just the mood swings and other behaviors are just so hard to deal with sometimes. It's been 5 1/2 months and almost everything about the person I started dating is gone, but I have fallen in love with him all over again every step of the way. I guess what I am really asking for is advice on how to get through this tough stage. How long does it typically last before completely leveling out? What are some other things to look forward to? Etc. I just need some support. I am trying so hard to be strong for him while he goes through this, but sometimes I need someone to lean on as well. \n\nSorry for it being so long.

When I think of my mistakes and things I should have done but was not smart enough to realize I should have done at the time (regrets), my eyes fill with tears and I feel a great sadness inside. The very unfairness of life comes not from this money hungry, ugly society we live in, but from within. The unfairness of breathing and living everyday when I very much do not want to be. The unfairness of not having a say in being born or realizing the crushing truths that consist of life's ugliness and wretchedness. The unfairness of being forced to participate as a human being, and putting up with the bullshit of everyday life, when I don't want to, or see the point in anything. The only thing that stops me from ending myself, is the impact it would have on my mother. That's it. In all other aspects of life that give it meaning, I have missed the boat and can never catch up to it.
